I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone and welcome to CBRE\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Our agenda for this morning\u2019s call will be as follows. First, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our fourth quarter results and expectations for the future. After their comments, we will open up the call for questions. Before I begin, I will remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE\u2019s future growth prospects, including 2021 outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment, financial performance, including profitability, margins and the effects of both cost savings initiatives in COVID-19 and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue, certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanation of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. Now please turn to Slide 4, which highlights our fourth quarter 2020 and full year financial results. During the fourth quarter, total revenue and fee revenue fell about 3% and 7% respectively driven by constrained transaction activity in Advisory Services. Lower revenue was more than offset by prudent cost management and the continued benefit of transformation initiatives that improved both our cost structure and operational agility. Overall, adjusted EPS grew nearly 10% to $1.45. GAAP EPS of $0.93 includes around $0.28 of transformation initiative costs. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year fourth quarter included a $0.67 tax benefit, primarily from legal entity restructuring. Excluding these unusual items in both periods, GAAP EPS would have been up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. Now for insights on results and our longer term strategy, please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Kristyn and good morning everyone. As you have seen, we ended 2020 on a high note with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE\u2019s competitive advantages, our ability to capture often overlooked industry opportunities and the resiliency we\u2019ve built into the business over the past decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the pandemic\u2019s unique effects on the office market. Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across four key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing presence in industrial, data centers and multi-family. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and facilities management, have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us, but our presence in Asia is robust and growing and our significant activity in Europe and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that have thrived over the past year. Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients purchased four or more services in 2020, up from less than a quarter a decade ago. Our broad diversification across these four key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12% in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80% peak to trough decline and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years. We are exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds. We have built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers\u2019 needs for greater flexibility in space obligations. This is reflected in our base case forecast, which nevertheless expects us to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments with meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles. One growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space. We identified this sector as an opportunity 3 years ago and have been building our Hana business expressly to meet rapidly rising demand from occupiers and investors. Our investment in Industrious now aligns this with an exceptional operator and outstanding leadership team that is executing a great strategy. With more than 100 units in 50 markets, Industrious enables us to participate in the flex space opportunity at scale and contribute meaningfully to Industrious\u2019 expansion. Now, Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021.\nLeah Stearns: Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8% respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This was partially offset by disciplined cost management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which in combination grew revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Global leasing revenue declined about 28%, as occupiers around the world continue to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the UK, which together comprise about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The UK again benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. We are also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% versus a decline of over 60% for those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels. The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multi-family transactional activity. Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269 billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific. Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together, declined about 4%. Property Management fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S. public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18% fewer projects than in the last year\u2019s fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity normalizes. Turning to Slide 9, our Global Workplace Solutions segment posted 3% fee revenue growth as a 7% increase in both Facilities and Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transactional revenue. Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base. While our new business pipeline remains solid, COVID restrictions continue to hamper new GWS client onboarding. We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and healthcare assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020. Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investment segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228% to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just 20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment. Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea. Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow driven by strong demand from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and predictability into our future development earnings. Lastly, Hana\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana\u2019s results were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to capitalize on this opportunity. Turning to Slide 11, we have ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion. This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding accelerates. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx investments to enhance growth, while preserving strong profitability. We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity. Turning to Slide 12, while considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business\u2019 resiliency and the world\u2019s continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturn due to the broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in industrial and multi-family transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid to high single-digits for the full year 2021. From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since by then, we will be comparing against the depressed levels of the pandemic\u2019s first month. Across the rest of advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with property management and mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year, reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization partially offset by the reversal of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select investments. Moving to GWS, we expect revenue to rise in the high single-digit range this year, with slightly better growth in adjusted EBITDA. The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding and catalyze GWS growth across project management and facilities management. Because of this, we expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to accelerate to low double-digits by year end. We believe this growth rate can be sustainable on a multiyear basis. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record-breaking adjusted EBITDA contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for compelling performance. In investment management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020\u2019s $475 million level, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020. This reflects some operating leverage as well as some incremental operating expense investments to enhance future growth. We project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid single-digit range from the $142 million generated this year. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow, reflecting increased appetite for warehouse and distribution space. We also envision targeted investments this year to expand our geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors, and accelerate future growth, including a new initiative to launch an industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe. We are seeing tremendous demand from U.S. based capital partners and occupiers for logistics facilities across Europe and are assembling an experienced team under the highly regarded Trammell Crow Company brand to meet this exploding demand. For our UK multi-family development business, we expect the pace of construction to pickup as COVID restrictions lift. As a result, we are forecasting this business to produce around $15 million more in adjusted EBITDA than the $3 million contribution it generated in 2020. All-in, we expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to approach our pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019, with some potential upside from our capital allocation activity. Turning to Slide 13, our track record over the last decade and notably over the last 12 months, has proven the resiliency of CBRE\u2019s business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth about a minimum low double-digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders. Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint. We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment through CBRE Global Investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment, which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jumpstart our growth while offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE\u2019s extensive platform capabilities. Finally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital, while preserving our investment grade credit ratings to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To this end, we view our shares as an attractive investment if we are unable to identify enough strategic acquisition opportunities at attractive valuations. We intend to resume our programmatic repurchase program and we will seek to repurchase shares as our financial capacity and valuation allows. We will provide progress updates annually as we pursue this multiyear growth framework. With that, please turn to Slide 14 and I will turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Leah. Before we take your questions, I want to briefly touch on CBRE\u2019s approach to environmental, social and governance issues. We know from our interactions with you that ESG is extremely important to our shareholders as well as our clients and our people. CBRE is determined to set the pace for our sector on ESG issues, particularly sustainability and diversity. Making measurable progress is one of my personal performance objectives for the year. When it comes to diversity, CBRE\u2019s commitment begins at the top. Our 12-person Board of Directors includes 3 women and 4 diverse men. Of the 13 executives who report to me, 5 are diverse. These direct reports include Tim Dismond, who is named Chief Diversity Officer last year. We have just expanded Tim\u2019s role to Chief Responsibility Officer and are bringing together all aspects of ESG, environmental sustainability, workplace safety and well-being, philanthropy and public affairs as well as diversity and inclusion under his leadership. One notable commitment is the use of our massive supply chain to advance diversity by spending $3 billion annually with minority and women-owned businesses by 2025. Accelerating our progress with recruiting and developing diverse team members remains a core focus. We are making steady progress as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index in late January. We have also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to make further gains. Late last year, we committed the science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than two-thirds by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world\u2019s largest manager of commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures, improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations, while benefiting our shareholders given the heightened demand for sustainability services. This is not only good for the planet it is simply good business practice. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. Leah and Bob, I was just wondering if you could maybe touch on I guess it\u2019s on Slide 11, it\u2019s the second bullet point where you talk about sort of accelerating future growth and rebalancing the portfolio. I am just trying to get a little bit more sort of understanding, is that sort of code for leasing and sales should come down sort of as percentages of the overall business and things like REI and GWS should be growing? Are there other things we should be thinking about as you talk about rebalancing?\nBob Sulentic: Yes, Steve. This gets back to the notion of us operating in a huge industry and having flexibility across four dimensions to adjust where we allocate our capital and focus the energies of our management team. So to repeat those four dimensions, it\u2019s product type, for instance, industrial versus office, etcetera. It\u2019s line of business, for instance, leasing versus project management versus facilities management. It\u2019s geographic spread and of course, it\u2019s client type. We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID and the crisis has caused us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under pressure. We have got a management team that\u2019s very well equipped to adjust focus and we got a balance sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus. And yes, we believe that we will be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those four dimensions that have secular advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient. And Leah can talk to you more about that. But we have really doubled down in thinking that way as it relates to our balance sheet and using the $4 billion of capacity we have. Leah, you want to add to that?\nLeah Stearns: No, I would just add, Steve, that from my perspective, this is really about ensuring that we are seeking to achieve the best total return from the investments that we make. And as we think about that, we will continue to evaluate our capital deployment strategy along the lines of ensuring that the returns that we seek are at or better than those presented by simply buying our stock back. So, ensuring that we are investing in areas where we will accelerate growth for the business. And as Bob just outlined, that is certainly aligned around our four dimensions of diversification as well as areas of secular tailwinds.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then I guess the second question sort of maybe piggybacks on that last statement just about the capital deployment, because I think you said in your comments that you would also look to maybe reinstitute a more programmatic share buyback, but I know you didn\u2019t buyback stock in the fourth quarter. So, just given the surge in the stock price, but obviously, earnings are clearly trending in the right direction. I guess how are you weighing the investment opportunities versus kind of the share buyback?\nLeah Stearns: Absolutely. We have a programmatic program. We have about $350 million remaining under our existing authorization. We will resume programmatic repurchases in the first quarter subject to meeting our valuation targets. And we look at that as the fact that we are currently in a net cash position and we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue both our M&A pipeline as well as begin returning capital back to shareholders through our share repurchase program. So, we feel we are in a very good position to be able to do that today. And given our view on the long-term growth of our business, we believe that it\u2019s an appropriate time to do so.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, thanks and good morning. My first question is on Industrious, can you talk about their specific business model whether it is currently in a profitable state or money losing state or like what that impact will be on CBRE in the near-term?\nBob Sulentic: Yes, Tony, we will only say with regard to Industrious\u2019 financials that we expect that acquisition to be accretive this year, not in a major way and then grow from there. But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we have been trying to do with Hana. It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model that means that they provide flex space as a service \u2013 as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers. They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana\u2019s client service that they beat us. They topped us. They were the one-off operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that there will be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hodari, their CEO, he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and broad relations across the occupiers around the world. So, we think that strategically Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years, because these occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They are going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They are going to want to be able to take smaller spaces away from their headquarters, so their people cannot have to come into CBDs in some cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn\u2019t. So, we think they were the perfect partner for us and we love where we have ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team, they would comment similarly on the situation.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And as CBRE\u2019s $200 million investment, does that provide enough capital for that to achieve a much larger scale over time or I don\u2019t know if the business model if [indiscernible] CapEx or how that works?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Tony, it\u2019s a capital-light model. They put in \u2013 it will provide them with some capital, but they are not spending a lot to expand that business. They are not taking on long-term leases. They are not putting them most of the tenant finish. So, they have the capacity to expand that business. We feel very good about that.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then on the M&A side, more broadly, you had mentioned a few times the pipeline there. Can you talk a bit more specifically on just whether you\u2019re seeing larger types of transactions or not, just given the financial capacity that you have?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Let me remind you how we think about M&A. We start with \u2013 and by the way, M&A and investments that we make, for instance, the Industrious investment, which clearly wasn\u2019t M&A. We, first and foremost, think about improving our ability to serve our clients, bringing something to the table that we didn\u2019t have before because at the core of our strategy is delivering outcomes to our clients they couldn\u2019t get elsewhere. We look across our business, all three segments. So advisory, GWS or outsourcing and REI, and we look for places where we can buy businesses to fill out our capability set. Of course, we\u2019re not going to do deals that don\u2019t make sense that don\u2019t achieve the hurdle rates we establish, so on and so forth. Right now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We\u2019re being very thoughtful about where we go. You know, Tony, we\u2019ve talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we think, have better growth profiles than others. So we are a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But we think we can find M&A opportunities across all three sectors. And I am going to highlight one that surprised everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the UK. That was an area where we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London that wasn\u2019t being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of that business, and now we\u2019re using our presence there to \u2013 and Leah commented on this, to expand into industrial development in the UK and Europe and very consistent with the model. That will be more of an organic expansion. But we think there is going to be opportunities across all three of our segments, some infill and some larger.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, thanks. And then last question maybe for Leah, I don\u2019t know if you explicitly mentioned margins \u2013 EBITDA margins for 2021. I may have missed it. But it seems like from all the brackets you\u2019ve provided on the business lines and so forth, it\u2019s pointing to margins being higher in \u201821 versus 2019 and 2020 full year numbers. Is that a fair assessment or is there anything to saying that could be an offset?\nLeah Stearns: We \u2013 correct, we did not speak specifically to margins. However, we have said that we do expect growth in GWS EBITDA to slightly outpace that of revenue as well as some slight margin improvement in advisory. So we are \u2013 we do expect slightly higher revenues that are pass-through in nature, and our REI business is related to Telford. That will create a little bit of margin pressure in REI. But net-net, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we expect flat to positive operating leverage for the year.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. Thanks for the help.\nOperator: The next question is from Rick Skidmore from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRick Skidmore: Good morning. Just to follow-up on the 2025 framework, Bob, can you just maybe talk a little bit about what that mix of organic versus, call it, inorganic growth might be that\u2019s embedded in that low double-digit growth rate expectation?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. I\u2019m going to make a broad comment on that, Rick, and then I\u2019m going to let Leah comment more specifically. But to get to that double-digit average growth rate between now and 2025, that threshold will be dominated by organic growth. It will include some capital investment in our REI businesses, co-investment, etcetera, and some M&A. But there is other capacity available beyond that, and I\u2019m going to let Leah speak about that.\nLeah Stearns: Thanks Bob. So the way we think about the base case is that we\u2019re effectively adding our organic growth from both the existing business we have and the benefit of a substantial portion of our free cash flow. We still have our investment capacity, given where our balance sheet sits today with a net cash position. And we think about leverage, the current position we are with respect to the cycle, we think we can operate around one turn leverage through deploying capital as it relates to M&A. And if we saw a strategic transaction, we would potentially take that to two turns, but would quickly de-lever from there back down. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about the base case, the opportunity for additional capital deployment as it relates to investments as well as capital return to shareholders.\nRick Skidmore: Great, thank you. And then just a follow-up on that, the comment about the projected decline of office, what\u2019s the base case assumption for how office demand changes over time and the impact on the business?\nLeah Stearns: So we\u2019ve taken a hard look at what we believe to be the impact office for our business. We certainly expect that to create some headwind from the secular decline. Today, our base case assumes a 200 to 300 basis point decline across our EPS CAGR as a result of that decline in office. And we are still able to offset that and achieve \u2013 we expect to be able to achieve a low double-digit EPS growth rate even given that headwind.\nRick Skidmore: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. On the M&A side, would you characterize the opportunities you\u2019re seeing as within those 4 silos you laid out in your outlook or are there areas potentially in logistics, infrastructure business services that you might consider to further diversify the company?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Jade, we always are open to M&A that would be adjacent to our business, not far adjacent but near adjacent to our business. And I\u2019m going to highlight again that Telford multifamily deal in the UK 1.5 years ago. But for the most part, we want to stay within the things we do because we have so much headroom for growth in the areas that we\u2019re already good but could be better at. We think that\u2019s the preferred place to deploy our capital. We think that\u2019s where the highest odds of success are. But we will look at things that are adjacent. I think you remember 3 years or so ago, we did an \u2013 in our investment management business, we did an infrastructure investment acquisition that we\u2019re very happy with. And I think that gives us opportunity for expansion. But we try to stay within our footprint for the most part when we do M&A.\nJade Rahmani: And thematically speaking, are you looking to strategies that would be considered more asset-light type businesses or would the majority of opportunities include balance sheet capital-intensive businesses such as the Telford?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Well, Telford is not particularly an asset-heavy business. We will have small co-investments in that, like we do in the rest of our development business. We have $14 billion or so of development in process. And Leah, how much capital do we have invested in that?\nLeah Stearns: Into Telford?\nBob Sulentic: No, in our total development, $200 million roughly. So Jade, that is not a capital-intensive development model that we deploy. However, I will say that across our REI business, we generated such strong returns on our co-investments. For instance, in our development business over the last 8 years or so, over 30% compounded IRRs on capital invested. We will look to put a little more money into the development business. We will look to put a little more money into co-investments in our REI business where we\u2019ve generated strong returns. But for the most part, when we buy services businesses that will be asset light, as Leah said in her prepared remarks, when you buy GWS or outsourcing businesses, you need some working capital to fund the growth, both of those individual client relationships, but we\u2019re mostly pretty asset-light. And I\u2019m going to say it again, one of the things we like so much about investors, very asset-light.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. And how much is the cumulative investment in Hana thus far?\nLeah Stearns: So in terms of Hana, we have invested approximately \u2013 I\u2019ll have to get you the exact number, Jade, but in terms of the current year, we had a loss of about $40 million related to Hana. And I\u2019ll get to the balance sheet number.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. Do you anticipate any internal reaction from the leasing broker sales force with respect to the industrial strategy? What do you think the implications are for the sales team?\nBob Sulentic: Well, we have two areas \u2013 you\u2019re talking about the leasing team that would either help the flex space operators get space in multi-tenant buildings or fill their space, right? Is that the group you\u2019re talking about?\nJade Rahmani: Yes. Yes.\nBob Sulentic: Okay. So the bottom line is we do not think this will impact that much at all. We serve some really good flex space operators out there, help them find space and help them fill their space. They will still be very anxious to have us do that. And of course, we\u2019re going to continue to do that with Industrious and look for ways to do some creative stuff on the services we provide to occupiers with that Industrious partnership. We don\u2019t think it will have a big impact on our broker\u2019s relationship with others. It\u2019s just the nature of the business. It\u2019s a very large opportunity.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. On the transaction outlook, I\u2019m curious as to why you would only expect mid to high single-digit growth in transaction revenue. I assume that\u2019s a blend of what you\u2019re anticipating in leasing, which would probably be at the lower end or perhaps below that, and capital markets, which would probably be at the high end or above that range. Is that why you are saying mid to high single-digit growth?\nLeah Stearns: Yes. That is \u2013 that\u2019s exactly correct. I would also note that you mentioned capital markets, but the transactions is just leasing and sales. So we do expect sales to be above that level, and we do expect leasing to be below. That does not include our debt and structured finance business, which we do expect to grow at a healthy clip.\nJade Rahmani: Okay, thank you very much for that. And just lastly, the transformational expenses, $120 million. Can you give what the full year number was? And is it possible to group that spend in categories so that we have a more specific understanding of what those initiatives relate to?\nLeah Stearns: Yes, absolutely. So we had really two types of costs this year \u2013 or in 2020 related to our optimization of our cost structure. First was workforce optimization. That was early in the year. It was really meant to address the immediate needs to respond to the changing demand environment as that was presented by COVID. We spent about $38 million on workforce optimization. We then turned our sights on transformation initiatives that were specifically targeted at changing the shape and the structure of parts of our business that are effectively positing us to be more agile going forward. We invested about $176 million into those transformation initiatives. We expect that the total run rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost. That\u2019s being offset in \u201821 by the resumption \u2013 or we had some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back. But net-net, we think there will be about $100 million of incremental savings in 2021 from the full work that we did in 2020 related to cost management. And this is spread across all three of our segments. Advisory was the largest. We estimate about 60% of our cost takeout was from advisory, with about 30% in GWS and the rest in our REI and corporate functions.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nStephen Sheldon: Good morning. Thanks. Great to hear about the continued trend in large customers purchasing more services from CBRE, I guess how much opportunity is there for CBRE to continue expanding relationships with these large customers? And how much does that factor into your confidence and the solid multiyear profit outlook?\nBob Sulentic: It factors massively into our confidence. We do work of some nature for virtually all of the Fortune 500 companies in all of the comparably large companies around the world. But we only do most of the real estate work for a very small handful of those companies. And there is some we don\u2019t do any for at all. And as I commented in my prepared remarks, if you went back a few years, we \u2013 quarter of our clients, we were doing multiple services for, for more services. Now it\u2019s 90%. It\u2019s gone up dramatically. And that\u2019s generally a trend when we take on work for these clients. We get in the door. We prove to them we can save them money or we can execute for them better on some basis than they have been getting on their own or from a myriad of providers, and we tend to grow those relationships. And it\u2019s been a powerful growth driver for us, and there is plenty of headroom for that to continue.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. And I guess, maybe related to this, what view do you have into how COVID and the issues of the last year have influenced the trend of customers slimming their vendor list? Is that \u2013 could it create any acceleration that, that has and could continue playing into your benefit as being in the next few years?\nBob Sulentic: I would say one thing, COVID has been done to everybody is anything they can do to streamline their business, make it simpler, cut cost is front and center for them. And generally speaking, working with fewer vendors is a benefit in that regard, and we\u2019re benefiting from that. That\u2019s been going on for years, by the way, but I think it\u2019s been accelerated by COVID.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then last one for me. I just wanted to \u2013 with the high investments and with the Industrious announcement, I guess, how do you envision companies utilizing flexible workspace in their broader real estate strategies over the next year or so, during this period of uncertainty with remote working and then longer term? And what client conversations have you been having there, I guess, in recent months? Are you seeing them more frequently considering, including flexible workspace? Just any detail on the demand trends that you are seeing?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Well, we had a huge amount of \u2013 one of the things that we\u2019ve just worn out during COVID is interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So first of all, I want to start with what we think in general. In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about 85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe 15%. Of course, we\u2019re all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID is over and there is not that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we\u2019re in the midst of COVID. We also know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they are going to want to make that a formal part of their portfolio. So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had two types of components to their portfolio. They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they are saying that\u2019s going to be a more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that\u2019s very high-quality, data security oriented towards corporate users that there is going to be big demand for what they do. They are not going to be the only ones. There is other providers that can do good work in that regard, too. But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients, and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Very helpful. Appreciate all the color and the guidance.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Funk from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Funk: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you for the questions. First, maybe related to an earlier question about market share gains, what type of market share gains are baked into your 2021 revenue estimates?\nLeah Stearns: So, Michael, when we look at our forecast each year, we do factor in our recent performance as it relates to recruiting as well as market share. So from our perspective, we continue to focus on taking number one, number two positions in really across the key markets in which we operate, and we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital towards those key recruiting initiatives in 2021.\nMichael Funk: And then I think in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that you are going to be reinvesting some of the savings from 2020 into OpEx in 2021, can you quantify that investment for us?\nLeah Stearns: Sure. We\u2019re not \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get too granular because we\u2019re not giving quantitative guidance for \u201821, but I would say a key part of our transformation initiative and the principle behind that was to ensure that we were reducing costs in certain areas, however, that we were \u2013 that would preserve our ability to maintain industry-leading margins as we invest into the opportunities and the secular tailwinds that we see presenting themselves as a result of coming out of COVID. So we believe that even with the investments that we\u2019re making, the cost takeout that we executed in 2020 will allow us to preserve those margins. So it\u2019s really across all three segments. We are investing across the business. It\u2019s across the key dimensions that Bob laid out. It\u2019s all in response to the intense strategy work that we took on throughout the course of the year. And we feel really good about how those investments are going to position us throughout \u201821 to really capture the long-term opportunities presented in the market today.\nMichael Funk: And then clearly, property sale is very strong in industrial, data center multifamily throughout 2020. Are you seeing a falling though in other property types as there now appears to be some glimmer of hope for a reopening or is there a greater interest in our property types?\nLeah Stearns: We\u2019re certainly seeing a glimmer of hope. I think the vaccine news in late 2020 was certainly a catalyst for investors to begin to come back off the sidelines for investment property sales. However, I think industrial and multifamily continue to be the real winners in terms of asset classes or property types in the market today, but we are seeing liquidity around other asset classes and we will continue to monitor that in \u201821.\nMichael Funk: And do you think that would be additive to the activity on the standard property types or do you think that would somewhat cannibalize that activity as capital moves to other property types?\nLeah Stearns: I don\u2019t see it as being cannibalistic. I think given the level of liquidity that\u2019s currently available and dry powder available in the hands of investors, I think that it will provide a nice uplift for sales in 2021, and that\u2019s reflected in our expectations.\nMichael Funk: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. Can you provide any commentary regarding CBRE\u2019s thought process for sponsoring the SPAC?\nBob Sulentic: We can, Patrick, and it\u2019s very much tied to that broad base of business we do across those four dimensions and the fact that we see an awful lot of opportunity out there when we do our M&A work to do business with companies that we can help and can help us, but they simply aren\u2019t the type of company for one reason or another that we should be buying in whole. So maybe it\u2019s a company that\u2019s super entrepreneur needs to have an ability to serve us and our competitors has a culture that\u2019s best independent, etcetera, etcetera; a brand that\u2019s best independent, but they can be really helpful to us, and we can be really helpful to them. When we contemplated doing the SPAC, that\u2019s what we had in mind. We would make an investment in those kind of companies. We would establish some kind of operating alliance with those type of companies, but we wouldn\u2019t buy them outright because of the reasons I just articulated. And we think that, that formula is going to work very well. We\u2019re seeing a bunch of companies that we think could be good candidates in the construction services arena, smart buildings, data centers, all kinds of things that serve buildings. We\u2019re quite confident we\u2019re going to find a good target for that SPAC, and there will be follow-on specs behind it. We\u2019re very differently situated than most SPAC sponsors. We have not really thought of as a financial sponsor. We\u2019re thought of as a strategic sponsor. And the way the SPAC is financially structured where our upside comes only when those \u2013 the company that we would quote de-SPAC grows in value speaks to our confidence that we can find a target partner and help them grow their business.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Great. That\u2019s helpful commentary. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, to what extent is existing facilities management clients reducing their office footprints posing a near-term headwind on GWS segment fee revenue?\nLeah Stearns: So near-term, Patrick, that\u2019s not a concern. We certainly are staying close to our GWS clients. They are looking to us for our expertise around workplace design and solutions. What is it\u2019s really created is a pause in their decision-making because for them to make significant outsourcing decisions that are long-term in nature, they need to have a clear understanding of how the footprint of their real estate needs will evolve over time. And so, it\u2019s not about a diminution or reduction of our existing revenue. It\u2019s more about a delay in our pipeline. And what\u2019s important to appreciate is that we have significant diversification across the clients that we serve within GWS. So we are not just serving their office footprint. We\u2019re also serving their data center needs. We are serving their for life sciences clients, we\u2019re serving their research facility needs. And so there is a lot of other opportunity out there across other property types and through our client diversification where we see significant opportunities for growth as well. So given the overall market size of integrated outsourcing, we currently think we have about a mid-single-digit market share in a $1.6 trillion market, I think a $200 billion market of the total asset market, which is about $1.6 trillion, I think there is still tremendous opportunity to grow that business and ensure that we are doing it aligned with our clients\u2019 needs.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Bob Sulentic for closing remarks.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks for joining us everyone and we\u2019ll talk to you again at the end of the second quarter \u2013 at the end of the first quarter, I\u2019m sorry.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristyn and good morning everyone. As you have seen, we ended 2020 on a high note with adjusted EPS for the quarter reaching an all-time high and adjusted EBITDA growing 9%. This capped a year of significant challenges stemming from COVID, but also one that brought to the forefront CBRE's competitive advantages, our ability to capture often overlooked industry opportunities and the resiliency we've built into the business over the past decade. This resilience has allowed us to offset the steep decline in sales and lease transactions and the pandemic's unique effects on the office market. Today, CBRE is more diversified than ever before across four key dimensions: property types, lines of business, geographic markets and clients. A few examples will bring definition to this. While office remains an important property type for us, its negative effects have been tempered by our large and growing presence in industrial, data centers and multi-family. Leasing is a key line of business for us that has been under pressure. However, other lines of business, such as GSE financing, investment management and facilities management, have all continued to grow. Geographically, New York, London and San Francisco are key markets for us, but our presence in Asia is robust and growing and our significant activity in Europe and second-tier U.S. markets has held up relatively well. We serve many clients that have been negatively impacted by COVID, but do a huge amount of business with technology, life science and other clients that have thrived over the past year. Reflecting how large companies increasingly rely on CBRE, nearly 90% of our 100 largest clients purchased four or more services in 2020, up from less than a quarter a decade ago. Our broad diversification across these four key dimensions has served us well compared with prior downturns. Adjusted EPS fell 12% in 2020. We expect earnings to rise to near peak profitability this year, the second year of the downturn and continue up from there. By comparison, during the great financial crisis, we suffered a more than 80% peak to trough decline and adjusted earnings per share did not return to the prior peak for 8 years. We are exiting the worst of the COVID crisis in great shape. Our strengths include a leaner operating structure, significant financial capacity and a strategy squarely aimed at the many opportunities unfolding in our industry, including those with secular tailwinds. We have built our long-term plan on the assumption that office demand remains under pressure due to a lasting increase in remote working and occupiers' needs for greater flexibility in space obligations. This is reflected in our base case forecast, which nevertheless expects us to achieve a minimum of low double-digit average annual adjusted EPS growth through at least 2025, absent a recession. This forecast is driven by organic growth and deploying capital, notably in M&A and real estate investments with meaningful upside potential from additional capital deployment. We expect to achieve this strong growth while continuing to evolve our business as we reduce contributions from lower secular growth business lines and increase our focus on areas that have higher secular growth profiles. One growth area we are particularly high on is flexible office space. We identified this sector as an opportunity 3 years ago and have been building our Hana business expressly to meet rapidly rising demand from occupiers and investors. Our investment in Industrious now aligns this with an exceptional operator and outstanding leadership team that is executing a great strategy. With more than 100 units in 50 markets, Industrious enables us to participate in the flex space opportunity at scale and contribute meaningfully to Industrious' expansion. Now, Leah will discuss the quarter and our outlook for 2021. Thank you, Leah. Before we take your questions, I want to briefly touch on CBRE's approach to environmental, social and governance issues. We know from our interactions with you that ESG is extremely important to our shareholders as well as our clients and our people. CBRE is determined to set the pace for our sector on ESG issues, particularly sustainability and diversity. Making measurable progress is one of my personal performance objectives for the year. When it comes to diversity, CBRE's commitment begins at the top. Our 12-person Board of Directors includes 3 women and 4 diverse men. Of the 13 executives who report to me, 5 are diverse. These direct reports include Tim Dismond, who is named Chief Diversity Officer last year. We have just expanded Tim's role to Chief Responsibility Officer and are bringing together all aspects of ESG, environmental sustainability, workplace safety and well-being, philanthropy and public affairs as well as diversity and inclusion under his leadership. One notable commitment is the use of our massive supply chain to advance diversity by spending $3 billion annually with minority and women-owned businesses by 2025. Accelerating our progress with recruiting and developing diverse team members remains a core focus. We are making steady progress as reflected in our earning a place on both the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in late January. We have also been recognized for our leadership in sustainability. For example, CBRE is the only commercial real estate services provider to land on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We are determined to make further gains. Late last year, we committed the science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets with the goal of cutting our emissions by more than two-thirds by 2035. We also pledged to make similarly ambitious reductions in the properties and facilities we manage for clients. As the world's largest manager of commercial properties, CBRE can play an outsized role in helping to limit the rise in global temperatures, improve the efficiency and sustainability of building operations, while benefiting our shareholders given the heightened demand for sustainability services. This is not only good for the planet it is simply good business practice. With that, operator, please open the lines for questions. Yes, Steve. This gets back to the notion of us operating in a huge industry and having flexibility across four dimensions to adjust where we allocate our capital and focus the energies of our management team. So to repeat those four dimensions, it's product type, for instance, industrial versus office, etcetera. It's line of business, for instance, leasing versus project management versus facilities management. It's geographic spread and of course, it's client type. We have done a ton of strategic work over the last year in response to COVID and the crisis has caused us to really get focused on what parts of our business are going to be accelerated given the current circumstance and the likely circumstance over the next few years and what parts are going to be under pressure. We have got a management team that's very well equipped to adjust focus and we got a balance sheet with lots of capacity to help us drive that adjustment to our focus. And yes, we believe that we will be moving in the direction of elements of our business across those four dimensions that have secular advantage or at least neutral as it relates to being resilient. And Leah can talk to you more about that. But we have really doubled down in thinking that way as it relates to our balance sheet and using the $4 billion of capacity we have. Leah, you want to add to that? Yes, Tony, we will only say with regard to Industrious' financials that we expect that acquisition to be accretive this year, not in a major way and then grow from there. But as it relates to their business model, it is so overlapping with what we have been trying to do with Hana. It was the perfect flex space operator for us to invest in. They have an asset-light model that means that they provide flex space as a service \u2013 as a service to landlord, as a service to tenants. They are not taking long-term leases and then turning around and doing short-term leases with occupiers. They are very, very riveted on client service. We were super proud of Hana's client service that they beat us. They topped us. They were the one-off operator in the marketplace that had better client service. They have a footprint of 100 units. It will be well over 100 with Hana and growing nicely from there so that there will be some scale to offer our occupier clients. And if you were to talk to Jamie Hodari, their CEO, he would tell you that one of the things he was excited about our ability to bring to the table is deep and broad relations across the occupiers around the world. So, we think that strategically Industrious is the right company for us to invest in and partner with in a sector that we believe is going to have really nice dynamics over the next several years, because these occupiers, as they rethink their space utilization, are going to want flexibility all over the place. They are going to want to be able to get in and out of space relatively quickly. They are going to want to be able to take smaller spaces away from their headquarters, so their people cannot have to come into CBDs in some cases or come into other areas of the CBD where the headquarter isn't. So, we think they were the perfect partner for us and we love where we have ended up there. And I think if you talk to Jamie and their team, they would comment similarly on the situation. Yes. Tony, it's a capital-light model. They put in \u2013 it will provide them with some capital, but they are not spending a lot to expand that business. They are not taking on long-term leases. They are not putting them most of the tenant finish. So, they have the capacity to expand that business. We feel very good about that. Yes. Let me remind you how we think about M&A. We start with \u2013 and by the way, M&A and investments that we make, for instance, the Industrious investment, which clearly wasn't M&A. We, first and foremost, think about improving our ability to serve our clients, bringing something to the table that we didn't have before because at the core of our strategy is delivering outcomes to our clients they couldn't get elsewhere. We look across our business, all three segments. So advisory, GWS or outsourcing and REI, and we look for places where we can buy businesses to fill out our capability set. Of course, we're not going to do deals that don't make sense that don't achieve the hurdle rates we establish, so on and so forth. Right now, we think there are some very good opportunities out there. We're being very thoughtful about where we go. You know, Tony, we've talked about it so much over the year. There are certain parts of our business, we think, have better growth profiles than others. So we are a little more oriented there when we do M&A. But we think we can find M&A opportunities across all three sectors. And I am going to highlight one that surprised everybody 1.5 years ago when we did the Telford Homes acquisition in the UK. That was an area where we came in. We realized that there was a real need for institutional quality, multifamily housing in London that wasn't being fulfilled. We had the opportunity to buy that business. We love the long-term profile of that business, and now we're using our presence there to \u2013 and Leah commented on this, to expand into industrial development in the UK and Europe and very consistent with the model. That will be more of an organic expansion. But we think there is going to be opportunities across all three of our segments, some infill and some larger. Yes. I'm going to make a broad comment on that, Rick, and then I'm going to let Leah comment more specifically. But to get to that double-digit average growth rate between now and 2025, that threshold will be dominated by organic growth. It will include some capital investment in our REI businesses, co-investment, etcetera, and some M&A. But there is other capacity available beyond that, and I'm going to let Leah speak about that. Yes. Jade, we always are open to M&A that would be adjacent to our business, not far adjacent but near adjacent to our business. And I'm going to highlight again that Telford multifamily deal in the UK 1.5 years ago. But for the most part, we want to stay within the things we do because we have so much headroom for growth in the areas that we're already good but could be better at. We think that's the preferred place to deploy our capital. We think that's where the highest odds of success are. But we will look at things that are adjacent. I think you remember 3 years or so ago, we did an \u2013 in our investment management business, we did an infrastructure investment acquisition that we're very happy with. And I think that gives us opportunity for expansion. But we try to stay within our footprint for the most part when we do M&A. Yes. Well, Telford is not particularly an asset-heavy business. We will have small co-investments in that, like we do in the rest of our development business. We have $14 billion or so of development in process. And Leah, how much capital do we have invested in that? No, in our total development, $200 million roughly. So Jade, that is not a capital-intensive development model that we deploy. However, I will say that across our REI business, we generated such strong returns on our co-investments. For instance, in our development business over the last 8 years or so, over 30% compounded IRRs on capital invested. We will look to put a little more money into the development business. We will look to put a little more money into co-investments in our REI business where we've generated strong returns. But for the most part, when we buy services businesses that will be asset light, as Leah said in her prepared remarks, when you buy GWS or outsourcing businesses, you need some working capital to fund the growth, both of those individual client relationships, but we're mostly pretty asset-light. And I'm going to say it again, one of the things we like so much about investors, very asset-light. Well, we have two areas \u2013 you're talking about the leasing team that would either help the flex space operators get space in multi-tenant buildings or fill their space, right? Is that the group you're talking about? Okay. So the bottom line is we do not think this will impact that much at all. We serve some really good flex space operators out there, help them find space and help them fill their space. They will still be very anxious to have us do that. And of course, we're going to continue to do that with Industrious and look for ways to do some creative stuff on the services we provide to occupiers with that Industrious partnership. We don't think it will have a big impact on our broker's relationship with others. It's just the nature of the business. It's a very large opportunity. It factors massively into our confidence. We do work of some nature for virtually all of the Fortune 500 companies in all of the comparably large companies around the world. But we only do most of the real estate work for a very small handful of those companies. And there is some we don't do any for at all. And as I commented in my prepared remarks, if you went back a few years, we \u2013 quarter of our clients, we were doing multiple services for, for more services. Now it's 90%. It's gone up dramatically. And that's generally a trend when we take on work for these clients. We get in the door. We prove to them we can save them money or we can execute for them better on some basis than they have been getting on their own or from a myriad of providers, and we tend to grow those relationships. And it's been a powerful growth driver for us, and there is plenty of headroom for that to continue. I would say one thing, COVID has been done to everybody is anything they can do to streamline their business, make it simpler, cut cost is front and center for them. And generally speaking, working with fewer vendors is a benefit in that regard, and we're benefiting from that. That's been going on for years, by the way, but I think it's been accelerated by COVID. Yes. Well, we had a huge amount of \u2013 one of the things that we've just worn out during COVID is interfacing with these occupier clients about what their expectations are about going back to the office. So first of all, I want to start with what we think in general. In general, we believe that on kind of a weighted average basis, clients will go back to the office at about 85% of where they were before. In other words, their weighted average headcount will be down maybe 15%. Of course, we're all going to learn a whole lot more about that once COVID is over and there is not that kind of psychological overhang of making those decisions while we're in the midst of COVID. We also know that most of the occupiers are going to want to have some remote capability for their people to come into the office. A lot of them are doing that now, but they are going to want to make that a formal part of their portfolio. So historically, when we work with these big clients, they had two types of components to their portfolio. They had space they own and space they lease in a traditional long-term way. They started to get into the flex space as a third option toward the end of the last cycle. And now they are saying that's going to be a more pronounced part of their portfolio of space going forward. So we think that means for companies like Industrious, in particular, Industrious, who has a offering that's very high-quality, data security oriented towards corporate users that there is going to be big demand for what they do. They are not going to be the only ones. There is other providers that can do good work in that regard, too. But we think that this will be a permanent piece in a bigger way of the portfolio of these occupier clients, and that will serve right into the heart of the Industrious strategy. Thank you. We can, Patrick, and it's very much tied to that broad base of business we do across those four dimensions and the fact that we see an awful lot of opportunity out there when we do our M&A work to do business with companies that we can help and can help us, but they simply aren't the type of company for one reason or another that we should be buying in whole. So maybe it's a company that's super entrepreneur needs to have an ability to serve us and our competitors has a culture that's best independent, etcetera, etcetera; a brand that's best independent, but they can be really helpful to us, and we can be really helpful to them. When we contemplated doing the SPAC, that's what we had in mind. We would make an investment in those kind of companies. We would establish some kind of operating alliance with those type of companies, but we wouldn't buy them outright because of the reasons I just articulated. And we think that, that formula is going to work very well. We're seeing a bunch of companies that we think could be good candidates in the construction services arena, smart buildings, data centers, all kinds of things that serve buildings. We're quite confident we're going to find a good target for that SPAC, and there will be follow-on specs behind it. We're very differently situated than most SPAC sponsors. We have not really thought of as a financial sponsor. We're thought of as a strategic sponsor. And the way the SPAC is financially structured where our upside comes only when those \u2013 the company that we would quote de-SPAC grows in value speaks to our confidence that we can find a target partner and help them grow their business. Thanks for joining us everyone and we'll talk to you again at the end of the second quarter \u2013 at the end of the first quarter, I'm sorry."

            "content": "Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA declined about 13% and nearly 8% respectively. These declines are mostly attributable to continued weakness in high-margin sales and leasing businesses. This was partially offset by disciplined cost management and strong performance by the rest of our advisory businesses, which in combination grew revenue nearly 11%. Overall, our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 120 basis points compared to a year ago. This margin benefited from cost optimization efforts and 210 basis points from substantially higher OMSR gains than in last year's fourth quarter. Global leasing revenue declined about 28%, as occupiers around the world continue to defer leasing decisions due to the pandemic. For the U.S., Continental Europe and the UK, which together comprise about 78% of global leasing, revenue decreased 36%, 18% and 6%, respectively. The UK again benefited from particularly strong industrial activity in the quarter, which helped offset subdued demand for office space. The continued growth of e-commerce drove industrial leasing revenue increases of 20% globally and 24% in the Americas. We are also seeing greater resilience among U.S. leasing transactions generating less than $1 million of revenue, which were down just 25% versus a decline of over 60% for those over $1 million. Advisory sales improved notably from Q3, but remained 15% below Q4 2019 levels. The Americas and APAC regions saw sequential improvement, paced by the U.S., where advisory sales revenue fell just 5% in Q4 compared with nearly 39% in Q3. Strength in the Americas reflected both U.S. market share gains of 90 basis points to nearly 19% and relatively strong industrial and multi-family transactional activity. Looking more closely at our activity with office assets underscores the benefits of our geographic diversification. In the Americas, office sales and leasing revenue fell over 50% compared to declines of around 30% for each in EMEA and 17% for sales and 20% for leasing in APAC. Commercial mortgage origination revenue rose 49% in the quarter, reflecting a surge in GSE lending, particularly targeted at affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and loan sales activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan originations, our loan servicing portfolio grew 17% to $269 billion, while servicing revenue grew nearly 25%. Valuation revenue grew about 4%, reflecting increased assignments for investor clients, particularly in Continental Europe, North Asia and Pacific. Finally, Advisory Property and Project Management together, declined about 4%. Property Management fee revenue grew just over 1%, while advisory project management declined 12%, as demand from U.S. public sector and industrial clients partially offset a steep decline in office. Notably, we completed 18% fewer projects than in the last year's fourth quarter, while the margin on these projects improved. We expect Project Management to benefit from pent-up demand as economies reopen and business activity normalizes. Turning to Slide 9, our Global Workplace Solutions segment posted 3% fee revenue growth as a 7% increase in both Facilities and Project Management offset a steep decline in GWS transactional revenue. Despite limited transaction revenue in the fourth quarter our GWS adjusted EBITDA margin expanded over 350 basis points to nearly 18%, marking our third consecutive quarter of record profitability. GWS margins continued to benefit from lower discretionary spending and structural changes to the cost base. While our new business pipeline remains solid, COVID restrictions continue to hamper new GWS client onboarding. We expect GWS growth to gain momentum in the middle part of this year as the economy continues to reopen. Despite these recent operational challenges, we expect our GWS business to continue benefiting from greater diversification across client sectors and property types. For example, our focus on specialized services for life sciences and healthcare assets resulted in a 240 basis point increase in revenue contribution from these clients in these sectors in 2020. In addition, our data center services business delivered notably strong revenue growth in 2020. Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investment segment achieved $110 million of adjusted EBITDA, a $68 million increase from the prior year Q4. Investment management adjusted EBITDA rose over 228% to nearly $53 million. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at nearly $123 billion, driving 15% growth in asset management fees. Importantly, just 20% of total AUM is invested in office, while industrial and logistics comprise our largest investment. Additionally, carried interest surged to $31.5 million versus just $9.7 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of the disposition of a retail property portfolio in South Korea. Development adjusted EBITDA rose to over $67 million, reflecting an elevated level of industrial asset sales in the quarter. Our in-process development portfolio continued to grow driven by strong demand from industrial clients, reaching a new record at $14.9 billion. Importantly, fee development and build-to-suit projects comprise more than half of this in-process portfolio, offering greater visibility and predictability into our future development earnings. Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of over $10 million was slightly more than that in Q3. Hana's results were impacted by the pandemic and the cost of building out new units. As Bob detailed earlier, we expect demand for flexible solutions to ramp up as the pandemic recedes and occupiers act on their desire for optionality in their real estate portfolios. Our investment and partnership with Industrious positions us to capitalize on this opportunity. Turning to Slide 11, we have ended 2020 with record free cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and considerable financial capacity. During 2020, free cash flow increased 68% to nearly $1.6 billion. This was partially driven by lower working capital required by our GWS business as new client onboarding slowed from a particularly strong pace in 2019. We expect this to modestly reverse as client onboarding accelerates. Nevertheless, we will benefit from improved cash management processes and our cost optimization efforts, which generated savings of around $120 million in 2020. Structural cost changes are expected to deliver over $100 million of incremental savings in 2021, even after accounting for the reversal of certain actions that were temporary in nature. These changes will enable us to pursue OpEx investments to enhance growth, while preserving strong profitability. We managed our balance sheet prudently heading into the downturn. This, coupled with the strong cash flow generation, enabled us to end 2020 with a net cash position and $4.6 billion of liquidity. Turning to Slide 12, while considerable uncertainty remains, we expect our business' resiliency and the world's continued progress in mitigating the pandemic to benefit our 2021 results. While transaction revenue has been weak, we have fared much better than in prior downturn due to the broad diversification of both deal sizes and property types. During 2021, we expect continued growth in industrial and multi-family transactions as well as a modest rebound in retail leasing to offset continued pressure in the office market. Within office, we anticipate quicker leasing improvement outside of the Americas. Overall, we expect transactional revenue growth in the mid to high single-digits for the full year 2021. From a sequential standpoint, we expect the sales and leasing revenue decline on a combined basis in Q1 relative to prior year to be similar to the pullback we saw in Q4 of 2020. The transactional revenue should begin to rebound in Q2, particularly since by then, we will be comparing against the depressed levels of the pandemic's first month. Across the rest of advisory, we expect high single-digit revenue growth, with property management and mortgage origination leading the gains. We expect modest margin improvement in advisory this year, reflecting this revenue growth and the full year effects of cost optimization partially offset by the reversal of some temporary cost savings measures we imposed during the depth of the crisis as well as select investments. Moving to GWS, we expect revenue to rise in the high single-digit range this year, with slightly better growth in adjusted EBITDA. The relaxation of COVID restrictions should enable faster client onboarding and catalyze GWS growth across project management and facilities management. Because of this, we expect sequential improvement in our GWS growth as we move through 2021, with the rate expected to accelerate to low double-digits by year end. We believe this growth rate can be sustainable on a multiyear basis. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record-breaking adjusted EBITDA contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for compelling performance. In investment management, we expect revenue to approximate 2020's $475 million level, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid to high single-digit range compared with the $125 million contributed in 2020. This reflects some operating leverage as well as some incremental operating expense investments to enhance future growth. We project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to rise in the mid single-digit range from the $142 million generated this year. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow, reflecting increased appetite for warehouse and distribution space. We also envision targeted investments this year to expand our geographic reach, deepen our position in growth sectors, and accelerate future growth, including a new initiative to launch an industrial and logistics development capability in Continental Europe. We are seeing tremendous demand from U.S. based capital partners and occupiers for logistics facilities across Europe and are assembling an experienced team under the highly regarded Trammell Crow Company brand to meet this exploding demand. For our UK multi-family development business, we expect the pace of construction to pickup as COVID restrictions lift. As a result, we are forecasting this business to produce around $15 million more in adjusted EBITDA than the $3 million contribution it generated in 2020. All-in, we expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to approach our pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019, with some potential upside from our capital allocation activity. Turning to Slide 13, our track record over the last decade and notably over the last 12 months, has proven the resiliency of CBRE's business and provides the foundation for enduring average annual earnings growth about a minimum low double-digits through at least 2025, with meaningful upside potential from additional capital allocation. We expect to further enhance our organic earnings growth through a combination of investments and capital returns to shareholders. Given our diversified business mix, we expect strong organic growth in key parts of our business to more than offset lower demand for office space as hybrid work models result in smaller corporate footprint. We see growth opportunities through increasing broker recruiting, digital and technology investment and principal and co-investment activity in our REI segment. A good example of this is our co-investment through CBRE Global Investors into private infrastructure programs, which is an area we expect will benefit from secular growth tailwinds. Initiatives like the SPAC sponsorship and Industrious investment, which partners us with an industry leader in flexible workspaces, can further jumpstart our growth while offering younger, developing companies the benefit of aligning with CBRE's extensive platform capabilities. Finally, we intend to dynamically allocate our capital, while preserving our investment grade credit ratings to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. To this end, we view our shares as an attractive investment if we are unable to identify enough strategic acquisition opportunities at attractive valuations. We intend to resume our programmatic repurchase program and we will seek to repurchase shares as our financial capacity and valuation allows. We will provide progress updates annually as we pursue this multiyear growth framework. With that, please turn to Slide 14 and I will turn the call back over to Bob for some closing remarks. No, I would just add, Steve, that from my perspective, this is really about ensuring that we are seeking to achieve the best total return from the investments that we make. And as we think about that, we will continue to evaluate our capital deployment strategy along the lines of ensuring that the returns that we seek are at or better than those presented by simply buying our stock back. So, ensuring that we are investing in areas where we will accelerate growth for the business. And as Bob just outlined, that is certainly aligned around our four dimensions of diversification as well as areas of secular tailwinds. Absolutely. We have a programmatic program. We have about $350 million remaining under our existing authorization. We will resume programmatic repurchases in the first quarter subject to meeting our valuation targets. And we look at that as the fact that we are currently in a net cash position and we believe we have ample liquidity to pursue both our M&A pipeline as well as begin returning capital back to shareholders through our share repurchase program. So, we feel we are in a very good position to be able to do that today. And given our view on the long-term growth of our business, we believe that it's an appropriate time to do so. We \u2013 correct, we did not speak specifically to margins. However, we have said that we do expect growth in GWS EBITDA to slightly outpace that of revenue as well as some slight margin improvement in advisory. So we are \u2013 we do expect slightly higher revenues that are pass-through in nature, and our REI business is related to Telford. That will create a little bit of margin pressure in REI. But net-net, I think it's fair to say that we expect flat to positive operating leverage for the year. Thanks Bob. So the way we think about the base case is that we're effectively adding our organic growth from both the existing business we have and the benefit of a substantial portion of our free cash flow. We still have our investment capacity, given where our balance sheet sits today with a net cash position. And we think about leverage, the current position we are with respect to the cycle, we think we can operate around one turn leverage through deploying capital as it relates to M&A. And if we saw a strategic transaction, we would potentially take that to two turns, but would quickly de-lever from there back down. So that's how we're thinking about the base case, the opportunity for additional capital deployment as it relates to investments as well as capital return to shareholders. So we've taken a hard look at what we believe to be the impact office for our business. We certainly expect that to create some headwind from the secular decline. Today, our base case assumes a 200 to 300 basis point decline across our EPS CAGR as a result of that decline in office. And we are still able to offset that and achieve \u2013 we expect to be able to achieve a low double-digit EPS growth rate even given that headwind. Into Telford? So in terms of Hana, we have invested approximately \u2013 I'll have to get you the exact number, Jade, but in terms of the current year, we had a loss of about $40 million related to Hana. And I'll get to the balance sheet number. Yes. That is \u2013 that's exactly correct. I would also note that you mentioned capital markets, but the transactions is just leasing and sales. So we do expect sales to be above that level, and we do expect leasing to be below. That does not include our debt and structured finance business, which we do expect to grow at a healthy clip. Yes, absolutely. So we had really two types of costs this year \u2013 or in 2020 related to our optimization of our cost structure. First was workforce optimization. That was early in the year. It was really meant to address the immediate needs to respond to the changing demand environment as that was presented by COVID. We spent about $38 million on workforce optimization. We then turned our sights on transformation initiatives that were specifically targeted at changing the shape and the structure of parts of our business that are effectively positing us to be more agile going forward. We invested about $176 million into those transformation initiatives. We expect that the total run rate benefit from the $214 million of investment will be around $369 million of cost. That's being offset in \u201821 by the resumption \u2013 or we had some temporary costs that were cut in 2020 that will come back. But net-net, we think there will be about $100 million of incremental savings in 2021 from the full work that we did in 2020 related to cost management. And this is spread across all three of our segments. Advisory was the largest. We estimate about 60% of our cost takeout was from advisory, with about 30% in GWS and the rest in our REI and corporate functions. So, Michael, when we look at our forecast each year, we do factor in our recent performance as it relates to recruiting as well as market share. So from our perspective, we continue to focus on taking number one, number two positions in really across the key markets in which we operate, and we'll continue to allocate capital towards those key recruiting initiatives in 2021. Sure. We're not \u2013 I'm not going to get too granular because we're not giving quantitative guidance for \u201821, but I would say a key part of our transformation initiative and the principle behind that was to ensure that we were reducing costs in certain areas, however, that we were \u2013 that would preserve our ability to maintain industry-leading margins as we invest into the opportunities and the secular tailwinds that we see presenting themselves as a result of coming out of COVID. So we believe that even with the investments that we're making, the cost takeout that we executed in 2020 will allow us to preserve those margins. So it's really across all three segments. We are investing across the business. It's across the key dimensions that Bob laid out. It's all in response to the intense strategy work that we took on throughout the course of the year. And we feel really good about how those investments are going to position us throughout \u201821 to really capture the long-term opportunities presented in the market today. We're certainly seeing a glimmer of hope. I think the vaccine news in late 2020 was certainly a catalyst for investors to begin to come back off the sidelines for investment property sales. However, I think industrial and multifamily continue to be the real winners in terms of asset classes or property types in the market today, but we are seeing liquidity around other asset classes and we will continue to monitor that in \u201821. I don't see it as being cannibalistic. I think given the level of liquidity that's currently available and dry powder available in the hands of investors, I think that it will provide a nice uplift for sales in 2021, and that's reflected in our expectations. So near-term, Patrick, that's not a concern. We certainly are staying close to our GWS clients. They are looking to us for our expertise around workplace design and solutions. What is it's really created is a pause in their decision-making because for them to make significant outsourcing decisions that are long-term in nature, they need to have a clear understanding of how the footprint of their real estate needs will evolve over time. And so, it's not about a diminution or reduction of our existing revenue. It's more about a delay in our pipeline. And what's important to appreciate is that we have significant diversification across the clients that we serve within GWS. So we are not just serving their office footprint. We're also serving their data center needs. We are serving their for life sciences clients, we're serving their research facility needs. And so there is a lot of other opportunity out there across other property types and through our client diversification where we see significant opportunities for growth as well. So given the overall market size of integrated outsourcing, we currently think we have about a mid-single-digit market share in a $1.6 trillion market, I think a $200 billion market of the total asset market, which is about $1.6 trillion, I think there is still tremendous opportunity to grow that business and ensure that we are doing it aligned with our clients' needs."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and posted it on the Investor Relations page of our website cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks, as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: first, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO will discuss our third quarter results in more detail. After their comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin I will remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE\u2019s future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance including profitability and margin, the effect of cost savings initiatives in our 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Total revenues and fee revenue fell about by 5% and 13% respectively, driven by the declines in advisory services segment. Lower revenue was partially offset by disciplined cost management and temporary cost reduction, as well as the initial benefits of transformation initiatives targeted to improve the ongoing cost structure of the business, which limited the adjusted EBITDA declined to 3%. Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.73, while GAAP EPS, which includes around $0.13 of transformation initiative costs totaled $0.55. Now for insight on the quarter and our longer-term outlook, please turn to Slide 6, as I turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks Kristyn, and good morning everyone. The results we reported this morning highlight the progress CBRE has made in building a more resilient business since the last downturn occurs more than a decade ago. We were markedly different company from the one that endured the global financial crisis. I'll briefly side some specific ways the company has evolved and improved. Facilities management, which provide steady recurring revenue has grown exponentially with the portfolio up by 3.7 billion square feet in 10 years, and now totaling 4.2 billion square feet. And we have added a data center management capability that is growing robustly. Our industrial and multifamily offerings have also grown dramatically and are proving to be very resilient in the current environment. These offerings together cut across leasing, sales and mortgage origination and servicing. They also comprise the majority of our real estate development portfolio. U.S. project management has grown five-fold in 10 years, and COVID is further capitalizing demand for this group's specialized services. Finally, our investment management businesses core asset portfolio, which has grown more than 300% over 10 years and now comprises nearly 85% of total AUM has held up quite well this year. The resilient aspects of our business are helping us whether the sharp COVID driven fall in property leasing and sales. Another key contributor was quickly aligning our expenses with reduced market demand. A significant portion of our compensation structure falls automatically in the current environment, and our global leadership team has rapidly implemented other cost management actions. Many of these actions were contemplated before COVID following a strategic review designed to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work has been quite effective cutting where appropriate without compromising our future. I want to briefly comment on the macro environment before handing the call to Leah. At the present time, COVID is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunities in other parts, several of which I highlighted earlier. Inevitably, the magnitude of COVID's impact will diminish considerably once the public health crisis passes. We can expect our sales and leasing businesses for decision making is now largely frozen to be prime beneficiaries. However, a significant amount of the COVID driven change will be permanent. For instance, our work with occupier clients confirms that companies will continue moving towards a hybrid model that combines working from the office and from home. Occupiers will take space for fewer employees but that space will be less densely populated, more intensely managed, and more flexible. There will be a premium on high quality well managed buildings with great infrastructure. We are continuing to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends that were driven by the last cycle, including occupier outsourcing, industrial and logistics space, institutional quality multifamily assets, and workplace experience services. We expect new secular opportunities to be created in the wake of COVID in our positioning our strategy and leadership focus and allocating our capital to make the most of them as the new cycle unfolds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the quarter in detail.\nLeah Stearns,: Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32% respectively, reflecting weakness and high margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to. While our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell about 180 basis points year-over-year, it improved sequentially approximately 560 basis points to about 15.5%. This sequential improvement was due to the combined impact of short-term cost reduction including continued furloughs, lower bonus accruals and tight management of travel and entertainment expenses, as well as the initial impacts of transformation and workforce optimization effort. Additionally, about 190 basis points of the sequential improvement was due to the cadence of COVID related items. Global leasing revenue declined about 31%, as the pandemic continue to negatively impact our major global market. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K. which together comprised about 81% a global leasing in the period revenue decreased 36%, 22%, and 6% respectively. The U.K. benefited from large industrial transaction during the quarter, which helped to offset weak demand for office space. Globally, industrial leasing fueled by the continued shift to e-commerce increased 10% in Q3, and 8% year-to-date. Advisory sales improved sequentially falling 34% year-over-year in Q3 versus 48% in Q2. All three regions saw sequential improvement paced by Continental Europe where Advisory sales revenue fell just 7% in Q3, compared to 26% in Q2. In the U.S., we added 280 basis points to our market share according to RCA, as investors seek out the best advice and execution in a challenging market. Given the high level of institutional dry powder and continued low interest rates, investor demand for quality real estate assets with strong rent rolls and creditworthy tenants remains solid despite the pandemic. Commercial mortgage revenue fell 21% in the quarter. The lending environment improved marginally from the second quarter, but lenders remain quite conservative in our underwriting standards which weighed on volumes. Notably multifamily volumes rebounded sequentially during the quarter and by September exceeded the prior-year level. Refinancing activity comprised 60% of our year-to-date originations up from the typical 40% to 50% range. Our other advisory services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Valuation revenue fell about 10% in line with the last quarter, while advisory property and project management and loan servicing each saw fee revenue growth of over 2%. Slower growth in loan servicing was the result of lower loan prepayment fees excluding prepayment fees, our servicing revenue would have grown at a low double-digit growth consistent with previous quarters. The loan servicing portfolio grew 13% over the prior year period and 3% sequentially to nearly $253 billion. Forbearance requests also continued to be immaterial for this business. Turning to Slide 9, our global workplace solutions business increased fee revenue, nearly 6% as 9% growth in facilities management, and 13% growth in project management offset a steep decline in GWS transaction revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly at 480 basis points to nearly 17% despite the loss of high margin transaction revenue. And this was our second consecutive quarter of record profitability. This strong improvement in profitability was partially driven by temporary measures primarily associated with lower discretionary spending and bonus accruals. Long-term cost efficiency initiatives and about $12 million in expenses in the prior year period that did not recurring. Structural changes to the cost structure contributed about one-third of the margin improvement. We also expect to drive gradual long-term improvements in profitability as our client relationship, expand and mature. Long tenured satisfied clients typically, expand their scope of service and engage us - to support their project and transaction management needs. While our margins are improving and our new business pipeline is strong. We continue to feel the effects of pandemic related to delays in securing and on boarding new GWS clients. Several large contract decisions slipped from Q3 to Q4, while others are temporarily on hold. As a result, we continue to expect top-line growth to be more muted than we would typically expect in a more normal recessionary environment. Turning to Slide 10, let's now look at our real estate investment segment where we achieved $65 million of adjusted EBITDA and $51 million increase from the prior year period. Development was the standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising to approximately $50 million, reflecting a large number of asset sales, and a small contribution from UK and multifamily development business we acquired last October. We are benefiting from positioning our portfolio to meet elevated demand for multifamily, industrial and healthcare assets. In fact, these three property type, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased comprised over 80% of our in-process activity. Because of this and our sizable pipeline, we expect our development business will remain resilient moving forward. Our investment management business also had an impressive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose over 12% and importantly, adjusted EBITDA from recurring sources increased nearly 70%. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at $114.5 billion and more than offset a lower contribution from carried interest revenue and co-investment returns. Lastly, Hana\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss of nearly $10 million was slightly higher than in the last quarter. Hana\u2019s results continue to be impacted by lower than anticipated occupancy. As a result of the pandemic, as well as costs associated with expanding our enterprise focused flexible space solutions. Turning to Slide 11, given COVID-19\u2019s uncertain trajectory and adverse economic impact, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, but will provide an update on our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter. In advisory, we are taking a conservative view of transaction activity in Q4. Transaction revenue has performed better than expected during this crisis, which is partially driven by the transaction size and geographic diversification embedded in our business. In the U.S. deals less than 250,000 which comprise over half of total transaction revenue declined about 26% year-to-date versus 40% decrease from transactions over 2 million. We anticipate a similar benefit of this diversification in our Q4 results, but also expect the transaction business to recover more gradually. We expect sales and leasing revenue together to be down approximately 30% to 40% in Q4, in line with the trends we saw in the second and third quarters with the Americas slightly lagging other parts of the world. For the rest of the advisory business combined, we foresee a mid-single digit revenue decline in the fourth quarter. This reflects the expectation that Q4 will be our highest revenue generating quarter as it usually is. Given this uptick in revenue and our continued focus on cost management, we expect advisory adjusted EBITDA fee margin to continue expanding by around 2% compared with Q3. Moving to GWS, we now believe growth in fee revenue will rise in the mid single-digit range for the year with growth and contractual facilities management and project management revenue offsetting continued weakness in GWS transaction. This marginally lower than normal growth expectation reflects our view that the pandemic related delays I mentioned earlier will improve more slowly than we previously expected. At the same time, we expect double-digit full-year adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting the benefit of stronger than expected Q3 performance and the continuation of our cost management efforts into Q4. We expect margin expansion will be slower sequentially as the benefit of temporary cost actions dissipate. Looking at REI, our global investment management and development business lines are well positioned for the current environment and we foresee more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In investment management, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will grow in the high teens range from the $91 million achieved last year. We now expect growth in recurring EBITDA stemming from our growing AUM, to be complemented by higher expectations for incentive fees and carried interest than we previously anticipated. We now project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to exceed more than $100 million generated in 2019. Demand for quality assets has been stronger than we previously anticipated and we now expect to complete more asset sales before year-end. We again expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from UK multifamily development in Q4. The pace of improvement since the peak of the pandemic has exceeded our expectations and we now expect a small, but positive EBITDA contribution from the UK multifamily development for the full year. This is an improvement from the breakeven performance we expected previously. And finally, our expectations for Hana remain consistent with our previous outlook with an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $35 million to $40 million for 2020 which is marginally higher than the loss incurred in 2019. Turning to Slide 12, we continue to fortify our financial position throughout the COVID-19 crisis. On a run rate basis, we have lowered our expense structure by nearly $200 million. We expect to realize about $120 million of this in 2020 and approximately $80 million in 2021. We primarily achieved these reductions by making structural changes in the design of our workforce, while also focusing on right-sizing our cost base and teams to meet future demand. In addition, our liquidity has increased by almost $1 billion from a year ago period to $4.2 billion and we ended Q3 with just 0.2 turns of leverage down over 0.4 turns from a year ago. This improvement reflects the long-term strategic work we initiated well before the pandemic to drive improvements in profitability and cash flow conversion. Given that we've been able to strengthen our financial position meaningfully at the depths of the COVID-19 crisis. We are highly confident we have ample capacity to attend future challenges while simultaneously deploying discretionary capital. As Bob highlighted at the outset of the call, we strongly believe there will be parts of our business that will benefit from COVID driven secular trends as well as portions that are likely to be adversely impacted. We plan to focus our discretionary capital deployment on areas where we believe the crisis is likely to accelerate demand. At the moment, we are deploying capital for internal investments and actively evaluating a steadily increasing M&A pipeline as we begin to see strategic opportunities. This means we\u2019ll prioritize internal investments and M&A rather than share repurchases. We want to ensure we are using our liquidity and financial capacity to enhance the revenue and profitability growth trajectory of our business as well as the resiliency of our business over the long run. We are also recognizing that the cost actions we've taken this year have impacted our people. As we've said before, once the time is appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly valued acquisition opportunities, we will then consider share repurchases. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're more confident than ever that our business and our capital structure, our position should not only weather the challenges presented by COVID, but to build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings and cash flow growth. With that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back to Bob.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks Leah. Before we take your questions, I want to briefly acknowledge our CBRE employees. Their hard work and strong focus on our clients are truly distinguishing our company at a time of significant challenges stemming from the public health crisis. These challenges have also brought us closer together as a company. The $6.1 million we raised from our people and the company for the CBRE Employee Resilience Fund has enabled us to provide more than 9,000 grants to our colleagues, who are facing financial hardship. We are pleased to help make their lives a little easier during this stressful time. Now, operator we'll take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I just wanted to circle up on a couple of things. Leah the $55 million in expenses that you talked about these transformation initiatives, I just wanted to get a little bit more understanding? How much of that was to benefit the current quarter, and how much of that is really kind of longer term kind of benefits to the company and how do we sort of measure or see those benefits going forward?\nLeah Stearns: Sure, Steve. The $55 million was one-time costs that we recognized in the quarter attributable to the separation and other expenses related to the transformation. Those will - in combination with workforce actions that we took in the second quarter will amount to about $200 million of run rate savings, a little more than half of that will benefit from this year, and the rest will commence in 2021.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, great thanks. And then I know you can't be too specific about the M&A activity, but I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit better feel for the areas, maybe if you think about your three divisions where you're more likely to deploy capital or maybe where you are more likely to see opportunities arise or maybe where you're seeing more opportunities today?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes Steve, this is Bob. We've gone through our business pretty carefully in the past year, it subject to a very thorough strategy update that we did. And we've identified areas of our business that we think either we're well positioned to grow disproportionately in or there will be secular tailwinds. And we're targeting those areas of our business for M&A activity. Now we'll do M&A activity in other areas if we think we can get particularly good deal or if we think we have holes in our geographic coverage, things of that nature. And ability to add to our capability for our clients, but we're really focused on some areas of the business that we think is going to have nice secular tailwinds and they're very much in line with what we do as part of our core offering. And we're pretty excited about what's out there for us right now, but I will say we're going to be patient. We're not going to run out just because we have the dry powder we have, because we're in a low point in the market cycle and buy up a bunch of stuff unless we think we can integrate it well. It's got a good cultural fit and we can make a reasonable deal.\nOperator: We'll go next to Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: First question is, I guess we'll stick with the M&A side of things, are you considering deals that just add to businesses that you're already in as you think about this. Are there new places, you think you can go into? Similarly in the last several years you've done. You did more runs approximately with data centers you build infrastructure on the investment management side? And so just curious if it's - if what you're focused on is additive or just new to the platform?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes Tony, we will look for things that are closely adjacent to what we do. And what we've been consistent with our skill set and relevant to our client base. We would not like go too far afield from that, because we think there is enough opportunities that would meet that requirement or be more quarter what we do, and that's basically how we think about that.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And do you see the opportunity you said having some sizing you had mentioned, it sounds like putting buyback on the back burner. So it sounds like - are these are potential size that you would not be able to do both?\nLeah Stearns: So Anthony it\u2019s Leah. Our current pipeline is actually larger than we could reasonably entertain in any one quarter. So we are being very cognizant of the opportunity set that we have. We want to make sure that we have sufficient dry powder to act quickly, if we find the right opportunity. And so from our perspective, we think it's the prudent measure given one, we have a very active M&A pipeline. And two, we are taking actions that directly impact our people for us to balance our approach on the buyback and put that off per quarter.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay great. And then on the cost side right, thanks for all the detail there. Just wondering if there is a way to think about it of the $200 million for instance, if we thought of 2019 as a baseline what piece of that should we think about as being I guess, more permanent that would change the margins on a more long-term basis?\nLeah Stearns: That is all incremental reduction from 2019 levels. So it is all run rate.\nAnthony Paolone: And you think that's all permanent not just part of the current environment and doing things more temporarily?\nLeah Stearns: Correct. There have been [ph] other actions that we've taken. For example, furloughs we\u2019re deferring, our compensation structure naturally reduces because of commissions and bonuses based on certain targets that were set at the outset of the year that won't be achieved. So those were not included in the $200 million. The $200 million is actual structural cost reductions, either through reducing - really through reducing overhead, and headcount basically headcount.\nAnthony Paolone: And then last one from me. You had mentioned in GWS a couple of items just slipping. I think last quarter you had mentioned I think mid-to-high single-digit topline and high single-digit EBITDA? Does that change I didn't catch if you had updated that part of it?\nLeah Stearns: So, we now expect the GWS revenue to be in the single-digit. However, we do expect profitability or EBITDA growth to be double-digit. So we have updated that.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jade Rahmani with KBW.\nJade Rahmani: Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just to start off with, I think last quarter. [indiscernible] said that the average office lease duration in their pipeline was down by about 16%. What kind of trend that you are seeing in terms of how occupiers are looking at their office exposure. And are you seeing a reduction in average lease maturity?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes Jade we\u2019ll - the overwhelming thing that\u2019s impacting average lease maturity is that a lot of the big long-term leases just have been put on hold, decisions aren't being made. We have that circumstance with our own portfolio of office space for our CBRE people. As everybody tries to figure out what space use is going to look like post-COVID those big decisions aren't being made. By the way, that's something that will definitively come back. We'll it all come back probably not, but much of it will come back and that's on hold. So the average lease is shorter as a result of that, what you're seeing now is renewals, extensions small deals getting done. But all of that impacts the averages and we expect that to continue as long is COVID is having the impact it\u2019s having now.\nJade Rahmani: Thanks very much for taking my question. Just separately I've gotten a lot of calls from investors today on the restructuring charges and I was wondering if you could provide any insight as to what types of actions. Those relate to was that on the advisory services business, was that as it relates to infrastructure and administrative back office functions? Where did the actions occur and should we really be expecting in terms of the fixed run rate benefit $200 million in annual savings?\nLeah Stearns: So Jade it\u2019s Leah, the distribution about 60% of it was in our advisory segment, about 30% was in GWS and about 10% was an REI that's a combination of the workforce actions we took in the second quarter as well as the transformation initiative that we launched in the third quarter. The third quarter, our actions were principally around the standalone exercise that we did. Just looking at the overall shape and structure of our organization and making sure that we were appropriately structured to be as efficient as possible coming out of this. So most of it is related to severance and other separation costs related to that action. We do have some lease terminations other things that have come through as we've thought to consolidate our workforce. But the vast majority of that is represented in terms of severance costs.\nJade Rahmani: And to what extent does it reflect a - expectation of a very moderate and drawn out recovery in transaction volumes with respect to perhaps 2021 and 2022 in terms of the advisory segment?\nLeah Stearns: Well, we certainly are very cognizant - and when we said that. I said that earlier that we do expect it to be a more moderate recovery. Therefore we are being very cautious around the expense structure for our advisory business. And so you should expect we'll continue to look at ways to make sure we're right-sized to ensure that our business and our workforce reflects the level of demand that's coming from our clients.\nJade Rahmani: And I guess if you could stratify the cost savings in terms of headcount reductions versus other structural changes you mentioned lease terminations. How would that be split amongst those two categories?\nLeah Stearns: The majority of it is severance costs.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. And then finally just on the EMEA outperformance on capital markets which you mentioned? What do you think is driving that and could that be a leading indicator as to a pickup in demand on that side of the transaction pipeline?\nLeah Stearns: Yes, we actually had some really strong performance across EMEA particularly in Continental Europe. So, certainly we'll watch each one of those markets Europe certainly came out of the COVID lockdown before the Americas that we're seeing some of that come back - overly cautious right now in terms of level of activity that we're expecting in the fourth quarter headed into 2021.\nOperator: We'll go next to Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.\nJosh Lamers: This is actually Josh Lamers on for Stephen Sheldon and thanks for taking questions here. I'm going to start with the recurring question but always good to gauge. Wondering how far along you characterize we are in the price discovery process on the investment sales side? Wondering if there are any indications that bid ask spreads could come in over the last couple of months and if not? Can you just outline why there is some valuation gap?\nLeah Stearns: I think it's going to be really important for us to see larger transactions on the leasing side occur before there significant transactions that come back from an overall capital markets activity perspective. So I think we are still a better ways away from seeing significant capital markets activity resume. One of the benefits though is that we are seeing more liquidity in the market and that will certainly help bringing our investment property sales business come back more - with more strength than we've seen in prior cycles where there has been more of a credit constraints in the market.\nJosh Lamers: And then just picking up with one of the prior question lines here just generally speaking on the leasing front, I mean we noted longer term delays and making longer-term leasing decisions. So based on the conversations more recently has it influenced your thought process in any way about leasing activity picking up in a more meaningful way in 2021, but is it seem that leasing activity is not going to resume at a higher level and so there some health resolution?\nRobert Sulentic: This summer we saw in the level of activity in discussions start to pick up some Stephen, but the fact of the matter is we are deeply engaged with most of the big occupiers around the U.S. and around the world and how they're thinking about this. And they really are looking for clarity - related to COVID before they make their big decisions. And this is really an important point there is two separate things going on here. One, we do think there will be some real change in the way office space is used. Going forward, we think there will be less people in the office. We think the offices that will be used less densely. We think there will be more intensively managed. We think buildings with great infrastructure will be favored. There is a whole separate issue from that though and the separate issue is the leasing it\u2019s going to get done. Isn\u2019t going to get decided on in this environment and that is going to come back. It's not all one thing it\u2019s a two separate things.\nJosh Lamers: And then switching gears to GWS good to hear that interactions and continued to hear. Although I have to say, I guess a little surprising from my perspective to hear that occupiers are delaying their decision making on this front. Just given that there is usually first year cost savings associated with outsourcing and then later and the added risk of managing operations due to COVID? So I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the reason behind the contract delays and what's your confidence at this point and GWS returning to double-digit growth next year?\nRobert Sulentic: We had very big backlogs of opportunities not only relative earlier this year, but relative to prior years, but the simple thing is there is so much physical presence that's needed to get these things done. People need to examine space. People need to think about moving people from one place to another people need to think about bringing project managers on site and getting work done. All of that is hard to be in this environment, decision makers traveling the C-space and uses inevitably slow things down. And clients very directly tell us that, they tell us that they're not in a decision making mode or their decision making has been delayed for those reasons. Not knowing how the space is going to get laid out when they move into it or when they move out of it. And so again, there is - it\u2019s so important as all of us think about what this means for our business, the use of office space and the impact of COVID on leasing or office occupancy. There is the absence of decision making that's taking place that will come back and happen when we go to the other side of COVID. And then there is the different way space will be used on the other side of COVID. It's really important to separate those two things.\nJosh Lamers: Okay, that all makes sense. And then last one from me, just looking to grab some comments from you on Hana you've noted that you're targeting to have tenants open by early next year now. Given your comments around office considerations and the outlook for the future I mean, does this become more of a priority looking ahead or - is it being rolled out I guess apart as you expect to maybe a year ago?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, so we believe that given what we've learned about the way space is likely to be used going forward. Several things greater flexibility more satellite type users because of people working from home. Company is hesitant to put capital in, because they're not sure how they're going to think about their space, long-term versus short-term. We believe that there is evidence that flex space like Hana will become more necessary than it is today. But like every other kind of office space out there. Most markets around the world people aren't going into the office space in short-term. They're working from home because of COVID. So in the short-term Hana has been impacted materially. It performed like we thought it was going to perform this quarter. But in the short-term it's been impacted materially like every other kind of office space has been in the long-term we believe that it could be a more prominent strategy than it has been historically, and we're pretty encouraged about the prospects for flex space in Hana.\nOperator: We'll go next to Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: How are you guys thinking about pressure in office rents wane on leasing capital markets revenue, on transaction volume does more fully rebound?\nLeah Stearns: So as we look at the level of activity that we see today, there has been a smaller impact or lesser impact on the secondary and tertiary markets relative to the large top 25 cities in the world. So if we look at the space needs, I think, near-term, there will be less impact on rents in some of those smaller markets, and particularly on smaller size leases. In those cases and in certain asset classes the property types like industrial, as well as multifamily on the capital market side, I think you will also see more price discovery happen sooner. But certainly from an office perspective, we're watching those smaller markets and those smaller space transactions really lead to the path for that price discovery, and we would expect that as COVID began to attenuate and we have a vaccine and better therapeutics we will be able to see more occupancy levels - occupancy level increase in office space and that should lead to more leasing decisions as Bob alluded to and help to drive more capital market transactions in office. So we certainly would expect there to be in terms of capital market activity, transactions happen where you have strong credit rent rolls, long-term tenant leases in place, those transactions are happening where we're seeing pause is really in the larger cities and in value add asset class space that where there's just too much risk for underwriting today.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: But when you do see the bid ask narrow into your major city centers in New York and Boston and San Francisco and those transaction start to happen again. If you thought that the rents and the building prices have to move lower in order to kind of hit that market clearing level. And if so, are you - is there a concern of that presents a long-term headwind in terms of the commission that you're making off of those transactions?\nLeah Stearns: I would say it's really ultimately going to depend how leasing decisions are made post-COVID. I think it's too early to say specifically where rents are going to go relative to where they are today. There may be some distressed assets where you do see some concessions, but it's not as though there is massive amount of vacancy or new assets coming online. You really have to see a radical shift in terms of occupancy need all at once, and you have to remember, most of these leases are over or coming up on renewal type over a long period of time, you don't see massive changes in terms of occupancy being able to execute it - being able to be executed in a very short period of time.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: And then I guess on the theme of major city centers versus secondary and tertiary areas. How are you thinking about the potential impact of urban slide on the multifamily business, as people want to maybe live in the suburbs and not in the city centers? Do you still see the same sort of structural demand for multifamily units as maybe you would have expected a year ago?\nLeah Stearns: Multifamily has really been driven by an underlying affordability issue for around housing, and so we don't see that abating and in fact is getting more challenging for us - for individual from a single-family perspective. So we certainly think there continue to be secular tailwinds for multifamily.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: And the last one from me and sorry to go back to margins again. But specifically with regard to your Global Workplace Solutions commentary that approximately one-third of the margin expansion was driven by structural improvements, does that imply the remaining two-thirds was due to more temporary cost reduction measures and those costs do come back in a more normalized environment?\nLeah Stearns: Correct.\nOperator: We'll go next to Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yes, thank you for the questions. So, just - if I could. So going back to your market share comments in the U.S. the 280 basis points during the quarter. Can you comment on this when you're seeing in the 4Q if you expect that market share gap to improve, and then what you attribute that improvement?\nLeah Stearns: So Michael, I think it's a bit too early to speculate on market share for the fourth quarter. Certainly something that we were pleased to see, and we will continue to monitor it, but I think it's just too early to make a call on that.\nMichael Funk: Okay. Maybe little more if I could then. So obviously early on, COVID put a pause on all the activity and you commented before they have very strong capital availability is driving sales cycle right now. Are you seeing any impact over in Europe in the recent [indiscernible]?\nLeah Stearns: It's way too soon Michael to make a call in terms of how that's going to impact the market in Europe.\nMichael Funk: Okay. I'll try one more time then. So the comment about more of the volume activity towards the low end of the margin expansion, which is out the below type of deals, and then more multifamily industrial. Are these more opportunistic deals, and is there enough potential pipeline there to continue that, you know, or - do you think it's more shorter-term benefits and we need to see more of a full recovery to see, I guess, carry through on the sales cycle?\nLeah Stearns: You're asking about the fourth quarter?\nMichael Funk: What you see during the third quarter [indiscernible] about these smaller deals, whether or not those kind of reflected more of a time normal course of business or as large enough pool for that to continue to help to drive similar type of activity?\nLeah Stearns: Yes, so once again I think we will see happen in the fourth quarter is the 731 exchange activity on transactions from a capital markets perspective that tends to be when we see quite a bit of multifamily transactions come to market in that smaller to mid-tier range. So that is something that we would expect to help build in the market particularly in the U.S. But we do have transactions happening within the sales part of our business. There are well diversified strong credit tenant, long duration rentals, underlying certain assets as well as certain asset classes, certain office assets, as well as certain asset classes like industrial multifamily that are commanding a tighter bigger spread. And that's resulting in transactions happening in the market. So we certainly think there are transactions out there to be done. And that was evidenced in the third quarter around our leasing and sales results. But it's certainly a more muted market just because there is such a significant pause going on around decisions that are being made particularly.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Bob Sulentic with closing remarks.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks everyone for joining us today and during this move from morning to afternoon, and we look forward to talking with you next time when we report our year-end results.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Leah Stearns",
            "content": "Sure, Steve. The $55 million was one-time costs that we recognized in the quarter attributable to the separation and other expenses related to the transformation. Those will - in combination with workforce actions that we took in the second quarter will amount to about $200 million of run rate savings, a little more than half of that will benefit from this year, and the rest will commence in 2021. So Anthony it's Leah. Our current pipeline is actually larger than we could reasonably entertain in any one quarter. So we are being very cognizant of the opportunity set that we have. We want to make sure that we have sufficient dry powder to act quickly, if we find the right opportunity. And so from our perspective, we think it's the prudent measure given one, we have a very active M&A pipeline. And two, we are taking actions that directly impact our people for us to balance our approach on the buyback and put that off per quarter. That is all incremental reduction from 2019 levels. So it is all run rate. Correct. There have been [ph] other actions that we've taken. For example, furloughs we're deferring, our compensation structure naturally reduces because of commissions and bonuses based on certain targets that were set at the outset of the year that won't be achieved. So those were not included in the $200 million. The $200 million is actual structural cost reductions, either through reducing - really through reducing overhead, and headcount basically headcount. So, we now expect the GWS revenue to be in the single-digit. However, we do expect profitability or EBITDA growth to be double-digit. So we have updated that. So Jade it's Leah, the distribution about 60% of it was in our advisory segment, about 30% was in GWS and about 10% was an REI that's a combination of the workforce actions we took in the second quarter as well as the transformation initiative that we launched in the third quarter.

Well, we certainly are very cognizant - and when we said that. I said that earlier that we do expect it to be a more moderate recovery. Therefore we are being very cautious around the expense structure for our advisory business. And so you should expect we'll continue to look at ways to make sure we're right-sized to ensure that our business and our workforce reflects the level of demand that's coming from our clients. The majority of it is severance costs. Yes, we actually had some really strong performance across EMEA particularly in Continental Europe. So, certainly we'll watch each one of those markets Europe certainly came out of the COVID lockdown before the Americas that we're seeing some of that come back - overly cautious right now in terms of level of activity that we're expecting in the fourth quarter headed into 2021. I think it's going to be really important for us to see larger transactions on the leasing side occur before there significant transactions that come back from an overall capital markets activity perspective. So I think we are still a better ways away from seeing significant capital markets activity resume. One of the benefits though is that we are seeing more liquidity in the market and that will certainly help bringing our investment property sales business come back more - with more strength than we've seen in prior cycles where there has been more of a credit constraints in the market.

So we certainly would expect there to be in terms of capital market activity, transactions happen where you have strong credit rent rolls, long-term tenant leases in place, those transactions are happening where we're seeing pause is really in the larger cities and in value add asset class space that where there's just too much risk for underwriting today. I would say it's really ultimately going to depend how leasing decisions are made post-COVID. I think it's too early to say specifically where rents are going to go relative to where they are today. There may be some distressed assets where you do see some concessions, but it's not as though there is massive amount of vacancy or new assets coming online. You really have to see a radical shift in terms of occupancy need all at once, and you have to remember, most of these leases are over or coming up on renewal type over a long period of time, you don't see massive changes in terms of occupancy being able to execute it - being able to be executed in a very short period of time. Multifamily has really been driven by an underlying affordability issue for around housing, and so we don't see that abating and in fact is getting more challenging for us - for individual from a single-family perspective. So we certainly think there continue to be secular tailwinds for multifamily. Correct. So Michael, I think it's a bit too early to speculate on market share for the fourth quarter. Certainly something that we were pleased to see, and we will continue to monitor it, but I think it's just too early to make a call on that. It's way too soon Michael to make a call in terms of how that's going to impact the market in Europe. You're asking about the fourth quarter? Yes, so once again I think we will see happen in the fourth quarter is the 731 exchange activity on transactions from a capital markets perspective that tends to be when we see quite a bit of multifamily transactions come to market in that smaller to mid-tier range. So that is something that we would expect to help build in the market particularly in the U.S. But we do have transactions happening within the sales part of our business. There are well diversified strong credit tenant, long duration rentals, underlying certain assets as well as certain asset classes, certain office assets, as well as certain asset classes like industrial multifamily that are commanding a tighter bigger spread. And that's resulting in transactions happening in the market. So we certainly think there are transactions out there to be done. And that was evidenced in the third quarter around our leasing and sales results. But it's certainly a more muted market just because there is such a significant pause going on around decisions that are being made particularly."

            "content": "Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our Advisory Services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell over 23% and nearly 32% respectively, reflecting weakness and high margin sales and leasing activities that Bob alluded to. While our advisory adjusted EBITDA margin fell about 180 basis points year-over-year, it improved sequentially approximately 560 basis points to about 15.5%. This sequential improvement was due to the combined impact of short-term cost reduction including continued furloughs, lower bonus accruals and tight management of travel and entertainment expenses, as well as the initial impacts of transformation and workforce optimization effort. Additionally, about 190 basis points of the sequential improvement was due to the cadence of COVID related items. Global leasing revenue declined about 31%, as the pandemic continue to negatively impact our major global market. In the U.S., Continental Europe and the U.K. which together comprised about 81% a global leasing in the period revenue decreased 36%, 22%, and 6% respectively. The U.K. benefited from large industrial transaction during the quarter, which helped to offset weak demand for office space. Globally, industrial leasing fueled by the continued shift to e-commerce increased 10% in Q3, and 8% year-to-date. Advisory sales improved sequentially falling 34% year-over-year in Q3 versus 48% in Q2. All three regions saw sequential improvement paced by Continental Europe where Advisory sales revenue fell just 7% in Q3, compared to 26% in Q2. In the U.S., we added 280 basis points to our market share according to RCA, as investors seek out the best advice and execution in a challenging market. Given the high level of institutional dry powder and continued low interest rates, investor demand for quality real estate assets with strong rent rolls and creditworthy tenants remains solid despite the pandemic. Commercial mortgage revenue fell 21% in the quarter. The lending environment improved marginally from the second quarter, but lenders remain quite conservative in our underwriting standards which weighed on volumes. Notably multifamily volumes rebounded sequentially during the quarter and by September exceeded the prior-year level. Refinancing activity comprised 60% of our year-to-date originations up from the typical 40% to 50% range. Our other advisory services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Valuation revenue fell about 10% in line with the last quarter, while advisory property and project management and loan servicing each saw fee revenue growth of over 2%. Slower growth in loan servicing was the result of lower loan prepayment fees excluding prepayment fees, our servicing revenue would have grown at a low double-digit growth consistent with previous quarters. The loan servicing portfolio grew 13% over the prior year period and 3% sequentially to nearly $253 billion. Forbearance requests also continued to be immaterial for this business. Turning to Slide 9, our global workplace solutions business increased fee revenue, nearly 6% as 9% growth in facilities management, and 13% growth in project management offset a steep decline in GWS transaction revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded nearly at 480 basis points to nearly 17% despite the loss of high margin transaction revenue. And this was our second consecutive quarter of record profitability. This strong improvement in profitability was partially driven by temporary measures primarily associated with lower discretionary spending and bonus accruals. Long-term cost efficiency initiatives and about $12 million in expenses in the prior year period that did not recurring. Structural changes to the cost structure contributed about one-third of the margin improvement. We also expect to drive gradual long-term improvements in profitability as our client relationship, expand and mature. Long tenured satisfied clients typically, expand their scope of service and engage us - to support their project and transaction management needs. While our margins are improving and our new business pipeline is strong. We continue to feel the effects of pandemic related to delays in securing and on boarding new GWS clients. Several large contract decisions slipped from Q3 to Q4, while others are temporarily on hold. As a result, we continue to expect top-line growth to be more muted than we would typically expect in a more normal recessionary environment. Turning to Slide 10, let's now look at our real estate investment segment where we achieved $65 million of adjusted EBITDA and $51 million increase from the prior year period. Development was the standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising to approximately $50 million, reflecting a large number of asset sales, and a small contribution from UK and multifamily development business we acquired last October. We are benefiting from positioning our portfolio to meet elevated demand for multifamily, industrial and healthcare assets. In fact, these three property type, plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased comprised over 80% of our in-process activity. Because of this and our sizable pipeline, we expect our development business will remain resilient moving forward. Our investment management business also had an impressive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose over 12% and importantly, adjusted EBITDA from recurring sources increased nearly 70%. This reflected continued strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record at $114.5 billion and more than offset a lower contribution from carried interest revenue and co-investment returns. Lastly, Hana's adjusted EBITDA loss of nearly $10 million was slightly higher than in the last quarter. Hana's results continue to be impacted by lower than anticipated occupancy. As a result of the pandemic, as well as costs associated with expanding our enterprise focused flexible space solutions. Turning to Slide 11, given COVID-19's uncertain trajectory and adverse economic impact, we will again refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance, but will provide an update on our expectations for the full year and fourth quarter. In advisory, we are taking a conservative view of transaction activity in Q4. Transaction revenue has performed better than expected during this crisis, which is partially driven by the transaction size and geographic diversification embedded in our business. In the U.S. deals less than 250,000 which comprise over half of total transaction revenue declined about 26% year-to-date versus 40% decrease from transactions over 2 million. We anticipate a similar benefit of this diversification in our Q4 results, but also expect the transaction business to recover more gradually. We expect sales and leasing revenue together to be down approximately 30% to 40% in Q4, in line with the trends we saw in the second and third quarters with the Americas slightly lagging other parts of the world. For the rest of the advisory business combined, we foresee a mid-single digit revenue decline in the fourth quarter. This reflects the expectation that Q4 will be our highest revenue generating quarter as it usually is. Given this uptick in revenue and our continued focus on cost management, we expect advisory adjusted EBITDA fee margin to continue expanding by around 2% compared with Q3. Moving to GWS, we now believe growth in fee revenue will rise in the mid single-digit range for the year with growth and contractual facilities management and project management revenue offsetting continued weakness in GWS transaction. This marginally lower than normal growth expectation reflects our view that the pandemic related delays I mentioned earlier will improve more slowly than we previously expected. At the same time, we expect double-digit full-year adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting the benefit of stronger than expected Q3 performance and the continuation of our cost management efforts into Q4. We expect margin expansion will be slower sequentially as the benefit of temporary cost actions dissipate. Looking at REI, our global investment management and development business lines are well positioned for the current environment and we foresee more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In investment management, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will grow in the high teens range from the $91 million achieved last year. We now expect growth in recurring EBITDA stemming from our growing AUM, to be complemented by higher expectations for incentive fees and carried interest than we previously anticipated. We now project U.S. development adjusted EBITDA to exceed more than $100 million generated in 2019. Demand for quality assets has been stronger than we previously anticipated and we now expect to complete more asset sales before year-end. We again expect sequential growth in adjusted EBITDA from UK multifamily development in Q4. The pace of improvement since the peak of the pandemic has exceeded our expectations and we now expect a small, but positive EBITDA contribution from the UK multifamily development for the full year. This is an improvement from the breakeven performance we expected previously. And finally, our expectations for Hana remain consistent with our previous outlook with an adjusted EBITDA loss of around $35 million to $40 million for 2020 which is marginally higher than the loss incurred in 2019. Turning to Slide 12, we continue to fortify our financial position throughout the COVID-19 crisis. On a run rate basis, we have lowered our expense structure by nearly $200 million. We expect to realize about $120 million of this in 2020 and approximately $80 million in 2021. We primarily achieved these reductions by making structural changes in the design of our workforce, while also focusing on right-sizing our cost base and teams to meet future demand. In addition, our liquidity has increased by almost $1 billion from a year ago period to $4.2 billion and we ended Q3 with just 0.2 turns of leverage down over 0.4 turns from a year ago. This improvement reflects the long-term strategic work we initiated well before the pandemic to drive improvements in profitability and cash flow conversion. Given that we've been able to strengthen our financial position meaningfully at the depths of the COVID-19 crisis. We are highly confident we have ample capacity to attend future challenges while simultaneously deploying discretionary capital. As Bob highlighted at the outset of the call, we strongly believe there will be parts of our business that will benefit from COVID driven secular trends as well as portions that are likely to be adversely impacted. We plan to focus our discretionary capital deployment on areas where we believe the crisis is likely to accelerate demand. At the moment, we are deploying capital for internal investments and actively evaluating a steadily increasing M&A pipeline as we begin to see strategic opportunities. This means we'll prioritize internal investments and M&A rather than share repurchases. We want to ensure we are using our liquidity and financial capacity to enhance the revenue and profitability growth trajectory of our business as well as the resiliency of our business over the long run. We are also recognizing that the cost actions we've taken this year have impacted our people. As we've said before, once the time is appropriate, if we are unable to identify suitable and properly valued acquisition opportunities, we will then consider share repurchases. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we're more confident than ever that our business and our capital structure, our position should not only weather the challenges presented by COVID, but to build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings and cash flow growth. With that, please turn to Slide 13 and I'll turn the call back to Bob."

            "name": "Robert Sulentic",
            "content": "Thanks Kristyn, and good morning everyone. The results we reported this morning highlight the progress CBRE has made in building a more resilient business since the last downturn occurs more than a decade ago. We were markedly different company from the one that endured the global financial crisis. I'll briefly side some specific ways the company has evolved and improved. Facilities management, which provide steady recurring revenue has grown exponentially with the portfolio up by 3.7 billion square feet in 10 years, and now totaling 4.2 billion square feet. And we have added a data center management capability that is growing robustly. Our industrial and multifamily offerings have also grown dramatically and are proving to be very resilient in the current environment. These offerings together cut across leasing, sales and mortgage origination and servicing. They also comprise the majority of our real estate development portfolio. U.S. project management has grown five-fold in 10 years, and COVID is further capitalizing demand for this group's specialized services. Finally, our investment management businesses core asset portfolio, which has grown more than 300% over 10 years and now comprises nearly 85% of total AUM has held up quite well this year. The resilient aspects of our business are helping us whether the sharp COVID driven fall in property leasing and sales. Another key contributor was quickly aligning our expenses with reduced market demand. A significant portion of our compensation structure falls automatically in the current environment, and our global leadership team has rapidly implemented other cost management actions. Many of these actions were contemplated before COVID following a strategic review designed to enhance scalability and efficiency. This work has been quite effective cutting where appropriate without compromising our future. I want to briefly comment on the macro environment before handing the call to Leah. At the present time, COVID is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunities in other parts, several of which I highlighted earlier. Inevitably, the magnitude of COVID's impact will diminish considerably once the public health crisis passes. We can expect our sales and leasing businesses for decision making is now largely frozen to be prime beneficiaries. However, a significant amount of the COVID driven change will be permanent. For instance, our work with occupier clients confirms that companies will continue moving towards a hybrid model that combines working from the office and from home. Occupiers will take space for fewer employees but that space will be less densely populated, more intensely managed, and more flexible. There will be a premium on high quality well managed buildings with great infrastructure. We are continuing to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends that were driven by the last cycle, including occupier outsourcing, industrial and logistics space, institutional quality multifamily assets, and workplace experience services. We expect new secular opportunities to be created in the wake of COVID in our positioning our strategy and leadership focus and allocating our capital to make the most of them as the new cycle unfolds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah, who will take you through the quarter in detail. Thanks Leah. Before we take your questions, I want to briefly acknowledge our CBRE employees. Their hard work and strong focus on our clients are truly distinguishing our company at a time of significant challenges stemming from the public health crisis. These challenges have also brought us closer together as a company. The $6.1 million we raised from our people and the company for the CBRE Employee Resilience Fund has enabled us to provide more than 9,000 grants to our colleagues, who are facing financial hardship. We are pleased to help make their lives a little easier during this stressful time. Now, operator we'll take questions. Yes Steve, this is Bob. We've gone through our business pretty carefully in the past year, it subject to a very thorough strategy update that we did. And we've identified areas of our business that we think either we're well positioned to grow disproportionately in or there will be secular tailwinds. And we're targeting those areas of our business for M&A activity. Now we'll do M&A activity in other areas if we think we can get particularly good deal or if we think we have holes in our geographic coverage, things of that nature. And ability to add to our capability for our clients, but we're really focused on some areas of the business that we think is going to have nice secular tailwinds and they're very much in line with what we do as part of our core offering. And we're pretty excited about what's out there for us right now, but I will say we're going to be patient. We're not going to run out just because we have the dry powder we have, because we're in a low point in the market cycle and buy up a bunch of stuff unless we think we can integrate it well. It's got a good cultural fit and we can make a reasonable deal. Yes Tony, we will look for things that are closely adjacent to what we do. And what we've been consistent with our skill set and relevant to our client base. We would not like go too far afield from that, because we think there is enough opportunities that would meet that requirement or be more quarter what we do, and that's basically how we think about that. Yes Jade we'll - the overwhelming thing that's impacting average lease maturity is that a lot of the big long-term leases just have been put on hold, decisions aren't being made. We have that circumstance with our own portfolio of office space for our CBRE people. As everybody tries to figure out what space use is going to look like post-COVID those big decisions aren't being made. By the way, that's something that will definitively come back. We'll it all come back probably not, but much of it will come back and that's on hold. So the average lease is shorter as a result of that, what you're seeing now is renewals, extensions small deals getting done. But all of that impacts the averages and we expect that to continue as long is COVID is having the impact it's having now. This summer we saw in the level of activity in discussions start to pick up some Stephen, but the fact of the matter is we are deeply engaged with most of the big occupiers around the U.S. and around the world and how they're thinking about this. And they really are looking for clarity - related to COVID before they make their big decisions. And this is really an important point there is two separate things going on here. One, we do think there will be some real change in the way office space is used. Going forward, we think there will be less people in the office. We think the offices that will be used less densely. We think there will be more intensively managed. We think buildings with great infrastructure will be favored. There is a whole separate issue from that though and the separate issue is the leasing it's going to get done. Isn't going to get decided on in this environment and that is going to come back. It's not all one thing it's a two separate things. We had very big backlogs of opportunities not only relative earlier this year, but relative to prior years, but the simple thing is there is so much physical presence that's needed to get these things done. People need to examine space. People need to think about moving people from one place to another people need to think about bringing project managers on site and getting work done. All of that is hard to be in this environment, decision makers traveling the C-space and uses inevitably slow things down. And clients very directly tell us that, they tell us that they're not in a decision making mode or their decision making has been delayed for those reasons. Not knowing how the space is going to get laid out when they move into it or when they move out of it. And so again, there is - it's so important as all of us think about what this means for our business, the use of office space and the impact of COVID on leasing or office occupancy. There is the absence of decision making that's taking place that will come back and happen when we go to the other side of COVID. And then there is the different way space will be used on the other side of COVID. It's really important to separate those two things. Yes, so we believe that given what we've learned about the way space is likely to be used going forward. Several things greater flexibility more satellite type users because of people working from home. Company is hesitant to put capital in, because they're not sure how they're going to think about their space, long-term versus short-term. We believe that there is evidence that flex space like Hana will become more necessary than it is today. But like every other kind of office space out there. Most markets around the world people aren't going into the office space in short-term. They're working from home because of COVID. So in the short-term Hana has been impacted materially. It performed like we thought it was going to perform this quarter. But in the short-term it's been impacted materially like every other kind of office space has been in the long-term we believe that it could be a more prominent strategy than it has been historically, and we're pretty encouraged about the prospects for flex space in Hana. Thanks everyone for joining us today and during this move from morning to afternoon, and we look forward to talking with you next time when we report our year-end results."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is now being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to, Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and posted it on the Investor Relations page of our website cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I will provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our second quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we will open up the call for your questions. Before I begin I will remind that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE\u2019s future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Now please turn to Slide 4 of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Total revenues and fee revenue fell about by 6% and 21% respectively, driven by the declines in advisory and RAI. Lower revenue coupled with $25 million of incremental COVID related costs and a $16 million donation into the company's COVID Relief Fund, caused adjusted EBITDA to fall 43%. Overall, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35, including the negative impact of around $0.10 attributable to the COVID related expenses and Relief Fund donation. Now for insights on the quarter and our longer term outlook, please turn to Slide six and I will turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning everyone. As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter, which impacts felt across every part of our business. However, the overall impact was cushioned by our diverse business mix, particularly the sustained growth of our contractual businesses over the past decade. We also benefited from early moves to reduce our expense base, a process that is continuing and strengthened our financial position and cash flow generation despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in our global workplace solutions segment demonstrated the resiliency of a business that occupier clients increasingly rely on in good times and bad to run essential operations and drive critical cost efficiencies. Since the global financial crisis, other parts of our business have become more resilient as well. For example, or U.S. development business is expected to earn twice as much both this year and next, as it did at the peak of the last market cycle. This reflects greater emphasis on core product development, particularly industrial and multifamily projects, along with an emphasis on fee development. We have built a 245 $billion loan servicing portfolio that adds growing recurring revenue to our capital markets offering, we are larger originators for Freddie and Fannie which are expected to match last year's loan volumes this year and we are positioned to capture a significant share of their business. Our investment management business grew nicely in the quarter. Today it earns a significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA from recurring asset management fees, this business continues to new capital at brisk pace. So the revenue base should grow. Like any major crisis COVID will have near term and long term affects on our sector and how we serve clients. In the near-term, we see precipitous drop in leasing and sales activity. Investment capitalist has moved to the sidelines as investors begin the process of price discovery. Occupiers are hesitant to make long-term decisions in mid the uncertainty preferring short-term, lease renewals where possible. Our ongoing interaction with major occupier clients has given us insight into their current thinking. Three distinct trends are emerging. First, most companies will give their employees greater flexibility to choose between working in the office and working from home. Second, the physical office will remain vitally important in these hybrid work models, particularly in fostering culture and collaboration and attracting talent. Third, the decades long densification trend is likely to reverse and gaining some of the effects on office demand associated with more remote working. The pandemic has elevated the importance of the workplace strategy on corporate agendas. Now more than ever, clients will need the strategic insight, thoughtful advice and reliable execution that CBRE and our people are best positioned to provide. We have built the company for opportunities like this and intend to capitalize on it. Now I'm going to turn the call over.\nLeah Stearns: Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our advisory services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 50% respectively, as expected significant weakness in our high margin, but cycles sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines. Our advisory adjusted EBITDA margins fell to around 10%, which was impacted by revenue compression about right million and incremental COVID related expenses and 11 million for the companies donation to a COVID relief fund. Together these items reduced the advisory margin, approximately 140 basis points from the quarter. Global leasing revenue declined about 38% as the pandemic negatively impacted our largest markets in the quarter, in the U.S. continental Europe and the UK, which collectively comprise over 80% of global leasing revenue decreased 43%, 25% and 20% respectively. Greater - global leasing this quarter achieved 14% growth following a 26% decline in Q1. While there was pressure across all property types in the quarter, industrial was resilient with leasing revenue declining just 10%. We saw similar pattern in property sales with global revenue down 48% and declined 26% in continental Europe, 51% in the U.S. and 76% in the UK. Notably we improved our U.S. market position significantly with 160 basis points share gain. Our 17.6% share for the quarter is 860 basis points more than our closest competitor. Like leasing, we saw a rebound in greater China with property sales climbing 46% after decreasing over 70% in Q1. Commercial mortgage revenue fell 28% as most capital sources pulled back from lending. We did however, see an increase in activity from banks with a strong appetite for offer an industrial project. The selling of credit markets that began in the second quarter has extended into July. Other advisory services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Advisory properties and project management revenue fell about 8%, driven by the temporary shutdown of construction activity and reduced spending on capital projects. Valuation revenue fell about 12% with modest growth in EMEA and our APAC market. Finally, loan servicing revenue grew 15% as our portfolio reached 245 billion, our multifamily properties which comprise nearly half of our global servicing portfolio, and more than two-thirds in the U.S. is proven to be resilient during the pandemic. We have just a handful of loans in forbearance and have not received a new request since May. Turning to Slide 9, our global workplace solutions segments saw lighter than usual revenue performance, but strong growth in profitability. Facilities management which accounts for more than 85% of the segments fee revenue, and is a contractual business saw 7% growth. This was offset by more cyclically sensitive project management and transaction services, which together posted a 33% fee revenue decline. Even with lower contributions from these higher margin revenue sources, and 17 million incurred for COVID related expenses and three million for the COVID Relief Fund. GWS's adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue expanded more than 170 basis points to 15.4%, leading to adjusted EBITDA, growth of more than 11%. This is the highest quarterly margin ever for the GWS business and our performance was driven by proactive cost management. We sustained a high contract renewal rate in the quarter, and the new business pipeline continued to increase from your end levels. COVID logistical challenges continue to hamper and prolong the contracting and on-boarding processes. Yet, after a pause at the onset of the COVID crisis, companies are beginning to move ahead without sourcing plans as they seek to capture efficiencies in a constrained economic environment. GWS is also a well diversified business, serving clients across a wide array of property types and industries, including many deemed essential during the current crisis. We are very proud of the work our GWS team continues to do supporting our clients during this challenging time. Turning to Slide 10. Our real estate investment segment adjusted EBITDA came in at 18 million down 41%, it included incremental COVID expenses and the relief fund donation allocation, which together totaled about $2 million. Investment management was a standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising 62%. This reflected strong growth and recurring asset management fees, AUM increasing three billion from a year-over-year period, as well as higher carried interest in co-investment returns partially offset by lower acquisition, incentives and disposition fees. Our focus on core and corporate strategies is highly advantageous in the current environment. Capital raising remains elevated totaling 11.4 billion over the past 12-months. As Bob mentioned, U.S. development is well positioned entering the downturn. Although adjusted EBITDA fell about 55% this is largely due to deal timing. We continue to be optimistic about second half performance as their in process activity stands at 13.7 billion. About half of that activity is comprised of fee development and built-to-suit and the remaining assets are well-capitalized with strong equity partners. Our development business in the UK incurred and adjusted EBITDA loss of 11 million during the period. This loss is largely attributable to transitory operational challenges due to COVID-19, including temporary construction, stoppages and other challenges, as well as constrained sales activity. We expect performance to improve now to construction and commercial activities have largely resumed. Lastly, the 9 million adjusted EBITDA loss in our enterprise focused co-working solution Connor was in line with Q1 performance. Connor's results in the period were impacted by mandated shutdowns and elevated costs to ensure the safety of occupants as units reopened. Let\u2019s now take a look at our 2020 outlook on Slide 11, given the continued uncertainty about COVID-19 trajectory and its impact on the broader economy we will again, refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance. However, we will discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2020 in detail. Starting with the advisory services segment, where our revenue declined was shallower than we expected in the second quarter. We now expect the recovery in our transaction businesses to be more gradual and drawn out. We expect revenue decline in Q3 and Q4, to be similar to that of Q2. With relatively better performance outside of the Americas. Sales and leasing revenue were off significantly in the quarter, benefited from robust pipelines built before the COVID crisis. Future performance is highly dependent on pipeline replenishments, and we are tracking signed confidentiality agreements and other leading indicators to inform our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the rest of the advisory business combined, we expect to mid to high single-digit revenue decline. Variable costs which comprise about half of our advisory cost structure are expected to decline a bit more than overall revenue. We anticipate a modest mid single digit decrease in advisory fixed costs, as it typically takes longer for our actions in this area to show an impact. Moving to GWS. We expect gross revenue to rise in the mid single-digit and fee revenue in the mid to high single-digits with growth in contractual facilities, management revenue offsetting an expected decline in GWS transaction revenue. As a result of disciplined cost management we also expect to achieve modest margin expansion, which will drive high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. This growth rate includes an expected headwind from COVID related items in the mid single-digit range. Our outlook is also premised on slower growth and facilities management revenue as we face tough compares in Q3 and Q4, when facilities management achieved growth of 15% and 18% respectively. Our first half results benefited from the high level of client on boarding in late 2019 that drove the strong prior year growth rate. Simultaneously while the logistical challenges of contracting and on boarding clients are slowly receding, we did not bring on new clients during the first half at the same pace as last year. This is expected to weigh on growth in Q3 and Q4 and we would expect growth to resume to double digit levels once these new clients\u2019 transitioned delays abate. Looking at REI, we continue to believe our core legacy business line global investment management and U.S. development are well positioned for the current environment and we anticipate more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment Management, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid teens range. As higher return adjusted EBITDA, is offset by lower contributions from Net Promote as dispositions flow and lower co-investment returns. We expect U.S. developments to contribute similar adjusted EBITDA as in 2019, as investors continue to have an appetite for high quality assets. At present nearly 80% of our in-process portfolio is comprised of healthcare, industrial and multifamily properties and office properties are 90% leased. We expect UK multifamily residential development to generate sequentially improved the adjusted EBITDA in each of the remaining quarters and be about breakeven for the year. Construction resumed during May and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business, given the housing shortage in the UK and our robust pipeline of new projects.  Similarly, we continue to believe in the long-term rationale for investment in Hana. But expect to incur a larger adjusted EBITDA loss in 2020 than in the prior year. This is primarily the results of additional units being brought online in 2020, as well as revenue delays due to COVID-19 related shutdowns, and longer new unit development period. Longer term, we see an opportunity for accelerated transition to an asset light investment model, partly catalyzed by dislocations in the flex space market. Turning to Slide 12, our financial position has continued to strengthen despite the challenges of COVID-19. We ended Q2 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, down 0.2 turns from a year-ago and 3.5 billion of liquidity, an increase of half a billion from the year ago period. In addition, we have no debt, maturing until 2023. Given the uncertainty around the virus' trajectory, and its impact on economic activity, we will continue to prioritize liquidity over discretionary capital deployment. Once we have more confidence in an economic recovery, we will resume deploying discretionary capital in line with our capital allocation strategy. In the meantime, we are continuing to prioritize investments in our people and platform and selective M&A. Our key focus will be companies that enhance the diversification of our service offerings and resiliency of the overall business by increasing the scale of less cyclical business lines. Finally, we view our share price is highly attractive at current levels and could resume repurchases when appropriate if we are unable to identify suitable and properly priced acquisition opportunities. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we are confident that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID, but build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings growth. With that, I will ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks Leah. This certainly has been a trying time for everyone. And we are proud of how our people who have helped our clients and our company to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19 recent months have also seen significant social unrest here in the U.S., which has called attention to the racial inequality and injustice that have persisted in our society for too long. It has also highlighted the need for better progress on diversity and inclusion within corporate America.  From speaking with many of you, we know that this topic is extremely important to our shareholders and you expect us to address it. So, I will take a few moments to tell you where we are. We have made progress with diversity and inclusion on several fronts, for example, since 2015, we have meaningfully increased diversity on both our board of directors and management executive committee and put more women into key leadership roles. These are important gains that we are proud of, at the same time we must do more to improve ethnic diversity at our company, particularly within our management and brokerage ranks. This is a challenge we are focused on and actively addressing. Last month we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, Tim Dismond, who has long been a senior leader at CBRE. Tim has joined the 12 member Global Executive Committee that is responsible for running our company and will report directly to me. We intend to give Tim the necessary resources and support to accelerate our progress on diversity and inclusion. This is a priority for me personally, as well as for the company. With that operator we will open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Anthony Paul from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\nAnthonyPaul: Thank you and good morning. I think one of the comments in the deck was around flexibility that folks are looking for. And I\u2019m wondering if part of that, if you could talk to whether you are seeing tenants doing more short-term renewals or looking for shorter leases and seeking flexibility doing things like to potentially reduce the commission pots in the near-term.\nRobertSulentic: Yes. Tony in the short-term tenants are definitively trying to make short-term decisions, given all the uncertainty that everybody is faced with what we have learned and we have confidence about is the following. And we have spent a lot of time, we surveyed our big clients that everybody knows the number of clients we have relationships with. So this is what we know. There will be more flexibility to do hybrid working going forward. There will be more work-from -home. There will also be a big focus on the office on an enduring basis. Something like 80% of the big clients we surveyed said that the office will be as important or almost as important as it was historically. And by the way, that answer came in the midst of the COVID crisis and all that goes with COVID crisis. The other thing we know is that space will be de densified. And so the net, net of what will happen is, yes, there will be more work-from-home, there will be less people in the office, but almost everybody will be back in the office in a less dense format. That is what will play out in the long run, in the short run people are trying to avoid making decisions till they have more clarity on what is going to happen with COVID-19.\nAnthonyPaul: Okay. Thank you for that. And then a question on cost savings, can you just talk about where you are making those changes, can they stick once activity starts to come back? Just how to think about that and then also the COVID expenses that you called out in the second quarter, it sounds like some of those went into fund, but I was just wondering if there is more of that to come in say 3Q or 4Q.\nLeahStearns: Anthony its Leah. I would start with your last part of your question. Those were primarily costs in the quarter that won't recur, unless we have significant resumption of lockdown. So, those are really onetime cost. We may have some going into the second half of the year, but I don't think will be at the same level that we saw in Q1 or Q2. And then with respect to cost savings, we are actively assessing the cost structure within the business. We want to make sure that we are structured to meet the demand environment that will evolve coming out of the current crisis. And so that is something that we certainly are looking at and expect to address over the next quarter to two. And we will certainly be able to provide more color on that when we come back and speak with you in the third quarter.\nAnthonyPaul: Okay, and the just last question. On the GSE business, have you seen any need or material amounts of P&I that you all have had to extend without getting money in the door, I think that I was a topic maybe last quarter and just curious as to what the update is there, what you are seeing now?\nLeahStearns: We are not seeing any material amount of forbearance requests, we have actually not received one since May, any of that was not material.\nAnthonyPaul: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live.\nJadeRahmani: Thank you very much for taking the questions and good to hear from all of you. I was wondering in terms of the transaction outlook, what key factors in your mind would drive an increase in terms of investor confidence, in terms of tenant confidence in their ability to consummate new transactions?\nLeahStearns: So there are certainly elements around the environment with respect to the COVID vaccine and the ability for investors to have confidence around the economic recovery that will come out of that. I think that is critical to regaining confidence. Part of the price discovery that is going on right now, I think start with seeing a recovery on the leasing side to really build confidence on the investor side. And so we need to see really where that equilibrium shakes out. We certainly are seeing activity continue. And it is not as severe as we had expected, as I said in my remarks, but I think it will be really critical to begin to see leasing decisions on a larger scale basis, particularly on the large leasing transactions. The place where we have seen the most significant decline is on those large transactions. We still have actually seen a high volume of transactions but on a relative basis, they have been on a smaller set of - or smaller size deals. So, I think we really need to see confidence come back ground leasing, that will lead to more strong and confident underwriting behind our investors clients. And I think that will lead to better capital markets performance in the future.\nJadeRahmani: Are you seeing any corporate occupiers contemplate strategies where they are going to be looking at satellite offices, suburban offices, and curtail their footprint in gateway markets?\nRobertSulentic: We have seen some of our big occupier clients try to figure out whether or not satellite formats are going to work for them. Almost nobody has made a definitive decision to move in that direction. And again, I think this is the circumstance we are in now, people are really trying to figure out how this is all going to play out before they make definitive decisions. But there isn't a lot of evidence yet that that satellite model is going to be prominent.\nJadeRahmani: And are you seeing companies make decisions to cancel or delay plans? Are you seeing an uptick in cancellations.\nRobertSulentic: The cancellations of leases or -.\nJadeRahmani: Yes. Of contracts that were in process, but not fully consummated.\nRobertSulentic: Yes. I think the bottom line is everybody is trying to not make long-term decisions now, when they are generally want to make short-term decisions, by the way, they are not making long-term decisions to give up or take space either direction.\nJadeRahmani: And in gateway markets, have you seen pressure in office rents? Are you seeing offs rents beginning to decline at this point?\nRobertSulentic: There hasn't been enough big deal gateway transactions to draw conclusions in that regard. I mean, literally we are in an environment where people are in the wait and see mode. Renewals are generally happening where they have been happening at.\nJadeRahmani: And just finally in the multifamily space where CBRE is a major lender to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could you give any insights as to how investors in that space are looking at the risk to the outlook, particularly in the U.S. based on a potential reduction in the government stimulus programs.\nLeahStearns: So for the GSEs and multi family businesses, one that is highly profitable and from a risk perspective performed incredibly well on a relative basis to the single family business that they run. So from our perspective, multifamily provides a much more affordable and cost effective way for occupants to maintain ownership of property. So we believe that the multifamily business under the GSEs is one that will be enduring and resilient through this cycle.\nJadeRahmani: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. \nSteveSakwa: Thanks. Bob, I wanted to maybe go back to the comment you made about the densification, and maybe just help us think through you guys do a lot of work with tenants and kind of laying out space, how much more space do you think overtime those tenants could take and the offset would be letting people work from home. So when you kind of net those two out, do you think we are kind of flat down or up kind of on space needs moving forward?\nRobertSulentic: Yes. I wish I could be more definitive Steve. Here is generally what happens though. By the way, this was happening before COVID, you look at the percentage of your people that are in the office at any given point in time and then you add a buffer on top of that, and you tend to size to that amount of space. So that is probably going to come down some if 10% or 15% or 20% of people are going to work a couple of days from home a week, that number will come down some, but the amount of space per person is going to go up meaningfully. I mean, offices have gotten pretty denced going into COVID-19. And that trend had been going on for years and years. We don't know exactly where that is going to play out. But it could offset most of the downward pressure in what we are seeing from people working from home. By the way, I will give you my personal view on this from having talked to a lot of clients. I think the certainty about people working from home to some degree is at least as high as everybody says it is. I think the certainty about people coming back to the office is higher than the headlines out there today, because it is exciting to give a headline to talk about all the productivity of working from home. But then you go talk to executives that run businesses that have to deal with on boarding new people, moving managers around, oversee new people, training people, dealing with collaboration, dealing with creativity. And what you hear is we got to get people back to the office. So, I mean, both of those trends have high certainly more working from home, and the importance of the office going forward, and maybe they will offset each other, the actual math hasn't sorted out yet.\nSteveSakwa: Okay, thanks. I guess second question would just be around the Hana business. And, we have seen sort of a big change in kind of we work and co-working in general. How are you just sort of looking at that business? And, kind of what is the expectation moving forward? Are you as excited about that business? Or do you think, that has got kind of a slower ramp to roll out and what have you seen on the utilization front?\nRobertSulentic: Well we are shutdown, Right. So, utilization is you can\u2019t get any read on utilization. But from day one Hana was a sweet model. It was a model that was oriented toward institutional occupiers strong focus on data security, strong focus on a very professionally managed environment. And here is what it does for occupiers that we believe will make it a an important concept going forward. It allows you to have the flexibility to move in and out quickly without capital expenditures. It allows you the flexibility to assemble teams in a particular market, or a different market for relatively short periods of time, by the way, not much, but years, instead of five years, a year or two years. We believe that will be at least as important going forward as it was before COVID-19. We are excited about the Hana model. We are anticipating that it will be more of a service provider model and that the landlords will actually own the units going forward. There was a move in that direction anyway. So, we think strategically Hana was oriented toward a market that we are going to see post COVID-19. And about two-thirds of the clients we surveyed suggested that co-working although they are going to call it flexible space going forward will be a significant part of what they do and their utilization of space in the future.\nSteveSakwa: Okay, and I guess last question. Leah, you made a comment about sort of preserving liquidity over discretionary capital spending, but then you said your share price is attractive, but you didn't buy back any stock in the quarter. So, I'm just sort of trying to kind of reconcile some of those comments and what would give you the confidence to buy back shares at these levels?\nLeahStearns: That comment was really around liquidity, it is really focused on the current environment Steve. So, as we think about our capital allocation policy and process and our overall strategy, we ultimately seek first to invest into our business. Our platform in short scalable, ensure we have the right after setting for operations. We then look at how do we add capabilities to our existing lines of business or potentially add new capabilities that will serve our clients in the most effective and value creative way. And ultimately, if those investment opportunities are kept or are exhausted, and we don't see anything that is attractive on the horizon, our next lever for us within the capital allocation strategy is our buyback. Now, that is something that we consider in the context of a more normalized environment. And we want to make sure that we use our buyback within a framework that is cognizant of our current leverage in the overall economic environment. And so my comments were meant to imply within our current capital allocation strategy in a normal environment, we would actually be in the market from a purchase perspective, but given the importance that we are placing on liquidity today because of the uncertainty around COVID we are taking a more conservative approach and therefore preserving capital. We believe that moments and times like this can create incredible opportunities for investments that wouldn't otherwise present themselves. And so we want to make sure that we aren't getting ahead of ourselves and using our more, normal economic environment, capital allocation strategy too early. And so really providing you context that we are still committed to that strategy once we have conviction that the recovery is in sight.\nSteveSakwa: Okay thanks that is it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today coming from Stephen Sheldon from Williams Blair. Your line is open.\nStephenSheldon: On the new business pipeline in GWS, now sound like that is going to continue to expand nicely here. So I guess, is there any way to quantify how much of the improvement you have seen in the pipeline there over the last few quarters? And just some more detail on the types of clients, and arrangements where you're kind of seeing traction right now. \nLeahStearns: So the GWS business, the pipeline is actually at double digit from a year ago, period. We are seeing activity across many different sectors, life sciences, T&T industrial. So I think overall, we are seeing lots of opportunities across many different areas of our client base. They are pretty similar to what we saw last year, but certainly the pipeline is up. I would add that the pipeline continues to grow. It is just the period of transition from when we sign a contract to then go into full transition mode. That is the part that has presented a challenge for us just in terms of driving growth out of that pipeline. We certainly, aren't seeing a lack of interest in our service offerings. It is just, we are in a moment of a crisis and there is a bit of a pause in terms of decisions that are being made, not just on our leasing and advisory business, but also within our occupier outsourcing business. So as soon as we begin to see momentum convert from that pipeline into transitions and ultimately allow us to begin monetizing those new outsourcing contracts, I think that business will be back on its normal double digit trajectory going forward.\nStephenSheldon: Got it. And then within investment sales, I get that there still a lot of crisis going on, but have you seen any conversions broadly and bid ask spreads, especially with some more economic data points since the pandemic began that could be used in underwriting. And additionally, what trends have you seen in terms of distressed sale activity that could pick up over the next few quarters?\nLeahStearns: So in terms of bid ask, you are right. I think going back to my earlier comments, we certainly believe that leasing or resumption of large leasing transactions will help drive confidence within our capital markets business in particularly the marquee transactions. We have seen some trade, EMEA, APAC were certainly doing much better relative to the U.S. from that perspective. And so from where we sit today, I wouldn't say that we believe that there is high competence. As I said, my prepared remarks, we expect the second half to be a continuation for transaction businesses of what we saw in Q2. It is just uncertain given all of the COVID related issues. If we do see a second whether or not there will be an opportunity for more price discovery. With respect to distress sales, there are some, but I would say investors are being very patient. I think it is important to remember that coming into this public health crisis, this was not a thing over stretched industry from an underwriting perspective, there was discipline cap rates were strong. And it wasn't a situation where there was over leveraged and significant in a bubble like activity. So we feel really good that owners and owners of properties today are sitting there and have their ability to be patient and can weather this crises.\nStephenSheldon: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming Michael Funk from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nMichaelFunk: Yes, thank you very much and good morning everyone. So thank you for the qualitative guidance. Actually, it is very helpful. And I understand your comment about the linkage between leasing and sales activity, but just so I understand it, so if we are assuming based on headlines that companies don't begin to run repopulating offices until sometime in 2021. Is it fair to assume that your baseline is that these trends continue well into 2021?\nLeahStearns: It is really too early to speak to, and again, we are just providing qualitative guidance for 2020 because of the uncertainty around the economic outlook, and how that relates to the current COVID environment. We are watching so many different indicators across the disease, the macroeconomic landscape and within commercial real estate, as an industry, and as we get more condition as to how that will lead into 2021. And the business trends will certainly provide that color, Michael I think it is just too early to say how it will translate today.\nMichaelFunk: Okay. And then on the on the relatively strong trend in Germany, China and Mexico. Is that something you see continuing through the remainder of the year are there reasonably that might change direction?\nLeahStearns: There was some marquee asset transactions that happened in our Germany business, I would say China's certainly whether resumption of activity posts the locked down, that certainly was a bright spot in the quarter. But I think those markets are smaller, we tend to see more volatility in the performance of those markets. And I would say just pointing to our broader statements around how we believe the second half will play out, we think that our international businesses will likely be a bit stronger just because they do have that diversification. Whereas in the U.S., we certainly have a strong belief that it will be a more muted environment.\nMichaelFunk: Okay And you just commented on price discovery, I guess that implies that people are putting pen to paper or at least paying attention to cap rates available assets. If that is true, I think you are in early conversations with potential investors, are you going to see color on where that bid ask spread is today. Let's say cap rates were, 3% pronounced at last, where is that essential bid today?\nLeahStearns: Again, there haven't been enough transactions to really give you a strong - to lead to strong conviction on my part if I can answer that question with any certainty. I would just say that there certainly are investors who are watching closely what is happening in all the markets. I think there are opportunities for domestic capital where, cross border capital maybe constrained due to travel restrictions, that presents unique opportunities for pension and other funds who may have historically been, sitting on the sidelines, because of the level of competition from foreign capital. That gives some pretty unique opportunities for investors in markets to capitalize on distressed sales if they are presenting themselves. But I would just say the volume of activity is just not sufficient enough for us to be able to say today what a bid ask is.\nMichaelFunk: And then one more if I could please. You said you are assessing the cost structure. And so, I didn't share any target range for cost savings, you have a target range for cost savings?\nLeahStearns: We certainly do. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think from my perspective, sitting here today, it is important for us to take a step back and look at the overall demand environment that is developing as it relates to all of the different lines of businesses that we currently operate and make sure that the business and the cost structure that we have going into 2021 is right sized. And so I don't want to jump to any conclusions as to what that will look like because we are watching several indicators and several trends develop, but we certainly are actively assessing opportunities across the platform to make sure that we are rightsizing the business from a fixed cost perspective as we head into the second half of the year in 2021.\nMichaelFunk: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nRobert Sulentic: Thank you everyone for being with us. And we will talk to you at the end of the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Leah Stearns",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. Turning to Slide 8, our advisory services segment fee revenue and adjusted EBITDA fell about 31% and 50% respectively, as expected significant weakness in our high margin, but cycles sensitive sales and leasing businesses drove the declines. Our advisory adjusted EBITDA margins fell to around 10%, which was impacted by revenue compression about right million and incremental COVID related expenses and 11 million for the companies donation to a COVID relief fund. Together these items reduced the advisory margin, approximately 140 basis points from the quarter. Global leasing revenue declined about 38% as the pandemic negatively impacted our largest markets in the quarter, in the U.S. continental Europe and the UK, which collectively comprise over 80% of global leasing revenue decreased 43%, 25% and 20% respectively. Greater - global leasing this quarter achieved 14% growth following a 26% decline in Q1. While there was pressure across all property types in the quarter, industrial was resilient with leasing revenue declining just 10%. We saw similar pattern in property sales with global revenue down 48% and declined 26% in continental Europe, 51% in the U.S. and 76% in the UK. Notably we improved our U.S. market position significantly with 160 basis points share gain. Our 17.6% share for the quarter is 860 basis points more than our closest competitor. Like leasing, we saw a rebound in greater China with property sales climbing 46% after decreasing over 70% in Q1. Commercial mortgage revenue fell 28% as most capital sources pulled back from lending. We did however, see an increase in activity from banks with a strong appetite for offer an industrial project. The selling of credit markets that began in the second quarter has extended into July. Other advisory services business lines were less impacted by COVID during the quarter. Advisory properties and project management revenue fell about 8%, driven by the temporary shutdown of construction activity and reduced spending on capital projects. Valuation revenue fell about 12% with modest growth in EMEA and our APAC market. Finally, loan servicing revenue grew 15% as our portfolio reached 245 billion, our multifamily properties which comprise nearly half of our global servicing portfolio, and more than two-thirds in the U.S. is proven to be resilient during the pandemic. We have just a handful of loans in forbearance and have not received a new request since May. Turning to Slide 9, our global workplace solutions segments saw lighter than usual revenue performance, but strong growth in profitability. Facilities management which accounts for more than 85% of the segments fee revenue, and is a contractual business saw 7% growth. This was offset by more cyclically sensitive project management and transaction services, which together posted a 33% fee revenue decline. Even with lower contributions from these higher margin revenue sources, and 17 million incurred for COVID related expenses and three million for the COVID Relief Fund. GWS's adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue expanded more than 170 basis points to 15.4%, leading to adjusted EBITDA, growth of more than 11%. This is the highest quarterly margin ever for the GWS business and our performance was driven by proactive cost management. We sustained a high contract renewal rate in the quarter, and the new business pipeline continued to increase from your end levels. COVID logistical challenges continue to hamper and prolong the contracting and on-boarding processes. Yet, after a pause at the onset of the COVID crisis, companies are beginning to move ahead without sourcing plans as they seek to capture efficiencies in a constrained economic environment. GWS is also a well diversified business, serving clients across a wide array of property types and industries, including many deemed essential during the current crisis. We are very proud of the work our GWS team continues to do supporting our clients during this challenging time. Turning to Slide 10. Our real estate investment segment adjusted EBITDA came in at 18 million down 41%, it included incremental COVID expenses and the relief fund donation allocation, which together totaled about $2 million. Investment management was a standout performer with adjusted EBITDA rising 62%. This reflected strong growth and recurring asset management fees, AUM increasing three billion from a year-over-year period, as well as higher carried interest in co-investment returns partially offset by lower acquisition, incentives and disposition fees. Our focus on core and corporate strategies is highly advantageous in the current environment. Capital raising remains elevated totaling 11.4 billion over the past 12-months. As Bob mentioned, U.S. development is well positioned entering the downturn. Although adjusted EBITDA fell about 55% this is largely due to deal timing. We continue to be optimistic about second half performance as their in process activity stands at 13.7 billion. About half of that activity is comprised of fee development and built-to-suit and the remaining assets are well-capitalized with strong equity partners. Our development business in the UK incurred and adjusted EBITDA loss of 11 million during the period. This loss is largely attributable to transitory operational challenges due to COVID-19, including temporary construction, stoppages and other challenges, as well as constrained sales activity. We expect performance to improve now to construction and commercial activities have largely resumed. Lastly, the 9 million adjusted EBITDA loss in our enterprise focused co-working solution Connor was in line with Q1 performance. Connor's results in the period were impacted by mandated shutdowns and elevated costs to ensure the safety of occupants as units reopened. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook on Slide 11, given the continued uncertainty about COVID-19 trajectory and its impact on the broader economy we will again, refrain from providing explicit EPS guidance. However, we will discuss our expectations for the remainder of 2020 in detail. Starting with the advisory services segment, where our revenue declined was shallower than we expected in the second quarter. We now expect the recovery in our transaction businesses to be more gradual and drawn out. We expect revenue decline in Q3 and Q4, to be similar to that of Q2. With relatively better performance outside of the Americas. Sales and leasing revenue were off significantly in the quarter, benefited from robust pipelines built before the COVID crisis. Future performance is highly dependent on pipeline replenishments, and we are tracking signed confidentiality agreements and other leading indicators to inform our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the rest of the advisory business combined, we expect to mid to high single-digit revenue decline. Variable costs which comprise about half of our advisory cost structure are expected to decline a bit more than overall revenue. We anticipate a modest mid single digit decrease in advisory fixed costs, as it typically takes longer for our actions in this area to show an impact. Moving to GWS. We expect gross revenue to rise in the mid single-digit and fee revenue in the mid to high single-digits with growth in contractual facilities, management revenue offsetting an expected decline in GWS transaction revenue. As a result of disciplined cost management we also expect to achieve modest margin expansion, which will drive high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. This growth rate includes an expected headwind from COVID related items in the mid single-digit range. Our outlook is also premised on slower growth and facilities management revenue as we face tough compares in Q3 and Q4, when facilities management achieved growth of 15% and 18% respectively. Our first half results benefited from the high level of client on boarding in late 2019 that drove the strong prior year growth rate. Simultaneously while the logistical challenges of contracting and on boarding clients are slowly receding, we did not bring on new clients during the first half at the same pace as last year. This is expected to weigh on growth in Q3 and Q4 and we would expect growth to resume to double digit levels once these new clients' transitioned delays abate. Looking at REI, we continue to believe our core legacy business line global investment management and U.S. development are well positioned for the current environment and we anticipate more resilient performance than during the last downturn. In Investment Management, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid teens range. As higher return adjusted EBITDA, is offset by lower contributions from Net Promote as dispositions flow and lower co-investment returns. We expect U.S. developments to contribute similar adjusted EBITDA as in 2019, as investors continue to have an appetite for high quality assets. At present nearly 80% of our in-process portfolio is comprised of healthcare, industrial and multifamily properties and office properties are 90% leased. We expect UK multifamily residential development to generate sequentially improved the adjusted EBITDA in each of the remaining quarters and be about breakeven for the year. Construction resumed during May and we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of this business, given the housing shortage in the UK and our robust pipeline of new projects.  Similarly, we continue to believe in the long-term rationale for investment in Hana. But expect to incur a larger adjusted EBITDA loss in 2020 than in the prior year. This is primarily the results of additional units being brought online in 2020, as well as revenue delays due to COVID-19 related shutdowns, and longer new unit development period. Longer term, we see an opportunity for accelerated transition to an asset light investment model, partly catalyzed by dislocations in the flex space market. Turning to Slide 12, our financial position has continued to strengthen despite the challenges of COVID-19. We ended Q2 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, down 0.2 turns from a year-ago and 3.5 billion of liquidity, an increase of half a billion from the year ago period. In addition, we have no debt, maturing until 2023. Given the uncertainty around the virus' trajectory, and its impact on economic activity, we will continue to prioritize liquidity over discretionary capital deployment. Once we have more confidence in an economic recovery, we will resume deploying discretionary capital in line with our capital allocation strategy. In the meantime, we are continuing to prioritize investments in our people and platform and selective M&A. Our key focus will be companies that enhance the diversification of our service offerings and resiliency of the overall business by increasing the scale of less cyclical business lines. Finally, we view our share price is highly attractive at current levels and could resume repurchases when appropriate if we are unable to identify suitable and properly priced acquisition opportunities. While the environment remains highly uncertain, we are confident that our business and our capital structure are positioned to not only weather the challenges presented by COVID, but build on our industry leadership position and maximize long-term earnings growth. With that, I will ask you to turn to Slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts. Anthony its Leah. I would start with your last part of your question. Those were primarily costs in the quarter that won't recur, unless we have significant resumption of lockdown. So, those are really onetime cost. We may have some going into the second half of the year, but I don't think will be at the same level that we saw in Q1 or Q2. And then with respect to cost savings, we are actively assessing the cost structure within the business. We want to make sure that we are structured to meet the demand environment that will evolve coming out of the current crisis. And so that is something that we certainly are looking at and expect to address over the next quarter to two. And we will certainly be able to provide more color on that when we come back and speak with you in the third quarter. We are not seeing any material amount of forbearance requests, we have actually not received one since May, any of that was not material. So there are certainly elements around the environment with respect to the COVID vaccine and the ability for investors to have confidence around the economic recovery that will come out of that. I think that is critical to regaining confidence. Part of the price discovery that is going on right now, I think start with seeing a recovery on the leasing side to really build confidence on the investor side. And so we need to see really where that equilibrium shakes out. We certainly are seeing activity continue. And it is not as severe as we had expected, as I said in my remarks, but I think it will be really critical to begin to see leasing decisions on a larger scale basis, particularly on the large leasing transactions. The place where we have seen the most significant decline is on those large transactions. We still have actually seen a high volume of transactions but on a relative basis, they have been on a smaller set of - or smaller size deals. So, I think we really need to see confidence come back ground leasing, that will lead to more strong and confident underwriting behind our investors clients. And I think that will lead to better capital markets performance in the future. So for the GSEs and multi family businesses, one that is highly profitable and from a risk perspective performed incredibly well on a relative basis to the single family business that they run. So from our perspective, multifamily provides a much more affordable and cost effective way for occupants to maintain ownership of property. So we believe that the multifamily business under the GSEs is one that will be enduring and resilient through this cycle. That comment was really around liquidity, it is really focused on the current environment Steve. So, as we think about our capital allocation policy and process and our overall strategy, we ultimately seek first to invest into our business. Our platform in short scalable, ensure we have the right after setting for operations. We then look at how do we add capabilities to our existing lines of business or potentially add new capabilities that will serve our clients in the most effective and value creative way. And ultimately, if those investment opportunities are kept or are exhausted, and we don't see anything that is attractive on the horizon, our next lever for us within the capital allocation strategy is our buyback. Now, that is something that we consider in the context of a more normalized environment. And we want to make sure that we use our buyback within a framework that is cognizant of our current leverage in the overall economic environment. And so my comments were meant to imply within our current capital allocation strategy in a normal environment, we would actually be in the market from a purchase perspective, but given the importance that we are placing on liquidity today because of the uncertainty around COVID we are taking a more conservative approach and therefore preserving capital. We believe that moments and times like this can create incredible opportunities for investments that wouldn't otherwise present themselves. And so we want to make sure that we aren't getting ahead of ourselves and using our more, normal economic environment, capital allocation strategy too early. And so really providing you context that we are still committed to that strategy once we have conviction that the recovery is in sight. So the GWS business, the pipeline is actually at double digit from a year ago, period. We are seeing activity across many different sectors, life sciences, T&T industrial. So I think overall, we are seeing lots of opportunities across many different areas of our client base. They are pretty similar to what we saw last year, but certainly the pipeline is up. I would add that the pipeline continues to grow. It is just the period of transition from when we sign a contract to then go into full transition mode. That is the part that has presented a challenge for us just in terms of driving growth out of that pipeline. We certainly, aren't seeing a lack of interest in our service offerings. It is just, we are in a moment of a crisis and there is a bit of a pause in terms of decisions that are being made, not just on our leasing and advisory business, but also within our occupier outsourcing business. So as soon as we begin to see momentum convert from that pipeline into transitions and ultimately allow us to begin monetizing those new outsourcing contracts, I think that business will be back on its normal double digit trajectory going forward. So in terms of bid ask, you are right. I think going back to my earlier comments, we certainly believe that leasing or resumption of large leasing transactions will help drive confidence within our capital markets business in particularly the marquee transactions. We have seen some trade, EMEA, APAC were certainly doing much better relative to the U.S. from that perspective. And so from where we sit today, I wouldn't say that we believe that there is high competence. As I said, my prepared remarks, we expect the second half to be a continuation for transaction businesses of what we saw in Q2. It is just uncertain given all of the COVID related issues. If we do see a second whether or not there will be an opportunity for more price discovery. With respect to distress sales, there are some, but I would say investors are being very patient. I think it is important to remember that coming into this public health crisis, this was not a thing over stretched industry from an underwriting perspective, there was discipline cap rates were strong. And it wasn't a situation where there was over leveraged and significant in a bubble like activity. So we feel really good that owners and owners of properties today are sitting there and have their ability to be patient and can weather this crises. It is really too early to speak to, and again, we are just providing qualitative guidance for 2020 because of the uncertainty around the economic outlook, and how that relates to the current COVID environment. We are watching so many different indicators across the disease, the macroeconomic landscape and within commercial real estate, as an industry, and as we get more condition as to how that will lead into 2021. And the business trends will certainly provide that color, Michael I think it is just too early to say how it will translate today. There was some marquee asset transactions that happened in our Germany business, I would say China's certainly whether resumption of activity posts the locked down, that certainly was a bright spot in the quarter. But I think those markets are smaller, we tend to see more volatility in the performance of those markets. And I would say just pointing to our broader statements around how we believe the second half will play out, we think that our international businesses will likely be a bit stronger just because they do have that diversification. Whereas in the U.S., we certainly have a strong belief that it will be a more muted environment. Again, there haven't been enough transactions to really give you a strong - to lead to strong conviction on my part if I can answer that question with any certainty. I would just say that there certainly are investors who are watching closely what is happening in all the markets. I think there are opportunities for domestic capital where, cross border capital maybe constrained due to travel restrictions, that presents unique opportunities for pension and other funds who may have historically been, sitting on the sidelines, because of the level of competition from foreign capital. That gives some pretty unique opportunities for investors in markets to capitalize on distressed sales if they are presenting themselves. But I would just say the volume of activity is just not sufficient enough for us to be able to say today what a bid ask is. We certainly do. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think from my perspective, sitting here today, it is important for us to take a step back and look at the overall demand environment that is developing as it relates to all of the different lines of businesses that we currently operate and make sure that the business and the cost structure that we have going into 2021 is right sized. And so I don't want to jump to any conclusions as to what that will look like because we are watching several indicators and several trends develop, but we certainly are actively assessing opportunities across the platform to make sure that we are rightsizing the business from a fixed cost perspective as we head into the second half of the year in 2021."

            "name": "Robert Sulentic",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning everyone. As expected, COVID-19 took a toll on our performance in the second quarter, which impacts felt across every part of our business. However, the overall impact was cushioned by our diverse business mix, particularly the sustained growth of our contractual businesses over the past decade. We also benefited from early moves to reduce our expense base, a process that is continuing and strengthened our financial position and cash flow generation despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. Double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in our global workplace solutions segment demonstrated the resiliency of a business that occupier clients increasingly rely on in good times and bad to run essential operations and drive critical cost efficiencies. Since the global financial crisis, other parts of our business have become more resilient as well. For example, or U.S. development business is expected to earn twice as much both this year and next, as it did at the peak of the last market cycle. This reflects greater emphasis on core product development, particularly industrial and multifamily projects, along with an emphasis on fee development. We have built a 245 $billion loan servicing portfolio that adds growing recurring revenue to our capital markets offering, we are larger originators for Freddie and Fannie which are expected to match last year's loan volumes this year and we are positioned to capture a significant share of their business. Our investment management business grew nicely in the quarter. Today it earns a significant majority of its adjusted EBITDA from recurring asset management fees, this business continues to new capital at brisk pace. So the revenue base should grow. Like any major crisis COVID will have near term and long term affects on our sector and how we serve clients. In the near-term, we see precipitous drop in leasing and sales activity. Investment capitalist has moved to the sidelines as investors begin the process of price discovery. Occupiers are hesitant to make long-term decisions in mid the uncertainty preferring short-term, lease renewals where possible. Our ongoing interaction with major occupier clients has given us insight into their current thinking. Three distinct trends are emerging. First, most companies will give their employees greater flexibility to choose between working in the office and working from home. Second, the physical office will remain vitally important in these hybrid work models, particularly in fostering culture and collaboration and attracting talent. Third, the decades long densification trend is likely to reverse and gaining some of the effects on office demand associated with more remote working. The pandemic has elevated the importance of the workplace strategy on corporate agendas. Now more than ever, clients will need the strategic insight, thoughtful advice and reliable execution that CBRE and our people are best positioned to provide. We have built the company for opportunities like this and intend to capitalize on it. Now I'm going to turn the call over. Thanks Leah. This certainly has been a trying time for everyone. And we are proud of how our people who have helped our clients and our company to navigate the COVID-19 crisis. In addition to the challenges of COVID-19 recent months have also seen significant social unrest here in the U.S., which has called attention to the racial inequality and injustice that have persisted in our society for too long. It has also highlighted the need for better progress on diversity and inclusion within corporate America.  From speaking with many of you, we know that this topic is extremely important to our shareholders and you expect us to address it. So, I will take a few moments to tell you where we are. We have made progress with diversity and inclusion on several fronts, for example, since 2015, we have meaningfully increased diversity on both our board of directors and management executive committee and put more women into key leadership roles. These are important gains that we are proud of, at the same time we must do more to improve ethnic diversity at our company, particularly within our management and brokerage ranks. This is a challenge we are focused on and actively addressing. Last month we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, Tim Dismond, who has long been a senior leader at CBRE. Tim has joined the 12 member Global Executive Committee that is responsible for running our company and will report directly to me. We intend to give Tim the necessary resources and support to accelerate our progress on diversity and inclusion. This is a priority for me personally, as well as for the company. With that operator we will open the lines for questions. Yes. Tony in the short-term tenants are definitively trying to make short-term decisions, given all the uncertainty that everybody is faced with what we have learned and we have confidence about is the following. And we have spent a lot of time, we surveyed our big clients that everybody knows the number of clients we have relationships with. So this is what we know. There will be more flexibility to do hybrid working going forward. There will be more work-from -home. There will also be a big focus on the office on an enduring basis. Something like 80% of the big clients we surveyed said that the office will be as important or almost as important as it was historically. And by the way, that answer came in the midst of the COVID crisis and all that goes with COVID crisis. The other thing we know is that space will be de densified. And so the net, net of what will happen is, yes, there will be more work-from-home, there will be less people in the office, but almost everybody will be back in the office in a less dense format. That is what will play out in the long run, in the short run people are trying to avoid making decisions till they have more clarity on what is going to happen with COVID-19. We have seen some of our big occupier clients try to figure out whether or not satellite formats are going to work for them. Almost nobody has made a definitive decision to move in that direction. And again, I think this is the circumstance we are in now, people are really trying to figure out how this is all going to play out before they make definitive decisions. But there isn't a lot of evidence yet that that satellite model is going to be prominent. The cancellations of leases or -. Yes. I think the bottom line is everybody is trying to not make long-term decisions now, when they are generally want to make short-term decisions, by the way, they are not making long-term decisions to give up or take space either direction. There hasn't been enough big deal gateway transactions to draw conclusions in that regard. I mean, literally we are in an environment where people are in the wait and see mode. Renewals are generally happening where they have been happening at. Yes. I wish I could be more definitive Steve. Here is generally what happens though. By the way, this was happening before COVID, you look at the percentage of your people that are in the office at any given point in time and then you add a buffer on top of that, and you tend to size to that amount of space. So that is probably going to come down some if 10% or 15% or 20% of people are going to work a couple of days from home a week, that number will come down some, but the amount of space per person is going to go up meaningfully. I mean, offices have gotten pretty denced going into COVID-19. And that trend had been going on for years and years. We don't know exactly where that is going to play out. But it could offset most of the downward pressure in what we are seeing from people working from home. By the way, I will give you my personal view on this from having talked to a lot of clients. I think the certainty about people working from home to some degree is at least as high as everybody says it is. I think the certainty about people coming back to the office is higher than the headlines out there today, because it is exciting to give a headline to talk about all the productivity of working from home. But then you go talk to executives that run businesses that have to deal with on boarding new people, moving managers around, oversee new people, training people, dealing with collaboration, dealing with creativity. And what you hear is we got to get people back to the office. So, I mean, both of those trends have high certainly more working from home, and the importance of the office going forward, and maybe they will offset each other, the actual math hasn't sorted out yet. Well we are shutdown, Right. So, utilization is you can't get any read on utilization. But from day one Hana was a sweet model. It was a model that was oriented toward institutional occupiers strong focus on data security, strong focus on a very professionally managed environment. And here is what it does for occupiers that we believe will make it a an important concept going forward. It allows you to have the flexibility to move in and out quickly without capital expenditures. It allows you the flexibility to assemble teams in a particular market, or a different market for relatively short periods of time, by the way, not much, but years, instead of five years, a year or two years. We believe that will be at least as important going forward as it was before COVID-19. We are excited about the Hana model. We are anticipating that it will be more of a service provider model and that the landlords will actually own the units going forward. There was a move in that direction anyway. So, we think strategically Hana was oriented toward a market that we are going to see post COVID-19. And about two-thirds of the clients we surveyed suggested that co-working although they are going to call it flexible space going forward will be a significant part of what they do and their utilization of space in the future. Thank you everyone for being with us. And we will talk to you at the end of the third quarter."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President and Corporate Finance. Thank you. You may begin.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, and it is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows: First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter; next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our first quarter results in more detail. After these comments, we'll open up the call for your questions. Before I begin, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Future growth prospects, operations, market share, capital deployment, acquisition integration, financial performance and 2020 outlook, including the impact of COVID-19 and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and 10-Q, respectively.  We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, fee revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Now please turn to slide four of our presentation, which highlights our financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Combined services revenue grew 13%, while adjusted EBITDA rose 8%, primarily driven by advisory services. Adjusted EBITDA in our Real Estate investment segment fell 56% year-over-year, largely due to a $27 million decline in co-investments in our Public Securities business, driven by the equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter and fewer large development deals that in Q1 2019. Overall, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA decreased modestly versus the prior year with strength in advisory services offsetting most of the REI decline. As a reminder, this will be the last quarter that we will provide geographic level disclosures based on the old segment reporting in our Excel supplemental, given the change to reporting three global business segments that we adopted at the beginning of 2019. Now for an update on our business fundamentals, please turn to slide six, and I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families' good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base. A significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure. As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively in early to take out nonessential costs. In early April, I decided to forgo my salary and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely, economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks. Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13. This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. I will cite five examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution. Given our strong balance sheet and industry-leading market position, we are poised to withstand the negative impacts of COVID-19, while also remaining very focused on identifying and capitalizing on potential long-term growth catalysts that will emerge from this crisis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah.\nLeah Stearns: Thanks, Bob. Turning to slide eight. Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non-revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses. Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest market, France and Germany delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior two quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. Certain advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and Property Management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.  Turning to slide nine. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in Project Management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.  Turning to slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions. Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our Investment Management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million and adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter. Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, Hana, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.  Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our two largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiments. Additionally, while our business is geographically diverse, the U.S. and U.K. comprise more than 70% of our global leasing and property sales revenue in 2019. We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio.  Thus far, a dominiums number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about two-three of the cost of sales in our advisory business is variable in nature as commissions decline in steps with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in advisory. Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations. As the pandemic creates pressures not seen in previous downturns, largely stemming from logistical challenges. Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges and on boarding new clients as a result of the current shelter in place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts.  Given the slower pace of growth expected in 2020, we are focused on improving our business processes to ensure we are ready to accelerate growth when business conditions rebound. We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect Project Management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work. Looking at REI. We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near-term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Investment Management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training. Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market, and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020. Until we have more clarity around COVID-19 impact on occupier demand. Turning to slide 12. Our financial position is strong, we ended Q1 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, liquidity of $3.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth. Our M&A strategy is focused on enhancing and differentiating our capabilities globally, and we believe that COVID-19 crisis may lead to unique and compelling opportunities. Finally, we may utilize our share repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program. And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position. In addition, our senior leadership team is taking decisive action to identify opportunities to further differentiate CBRE and position the business to accelerate once we are more certain of an economic recovery. With that, I'll ask you to turn to slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Leah. Before we conclude this morning's call, I'll take a few minutes to highlight ways that CBRE's business activities for clients are producing social good. We know this is of great importance to many of our shareholders because they tell us so on a regular basis. And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need has never been more urgent. CBRE teams around the world have been going to extraordinary links to serve our clients as they react to the demands of COVID-19.  In Spain, our team worked with our client, the Hospital Del Mar to convert the Hotel Barcelona Princess into an extension of the hospital. The 363 room field hospital opened on April one and serves more than 200 COVID-19 patients. CBRE's on-site technicians provided essential maintenance and installation services to keep the field hospital running. In the U.K., we supported our client National Exhibition Center in the creation of its Birmingham Nightingale field hospital for COVID-19 patients. The first phase of the hospital opened on April 16, our team delivered essential materials and services and provides ongoing maintenance of the hospital. In Atlanta, our project management team worked with our client, Piedmont Healthcare to move up the opening of the patient floors in a new building under construction by more than three months to create more capacity as the hospital prepared for potentially higher admissions due to COVID-19. While many of our people have been working remotely, we have some 40,000 professionals like the ones highlighted here who have been working at client locations to keep properties operational and essential projects moving forward. They are among the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, and we salute them. We also recognize that COVID-19 has caused significant hardship for some of our CBRE people. In response, we have set aside $5 million of our more than $15 million COVID-19 relief fund to help colleagues who have fallen on hard times. The fund's remaining $10 million is dedicated to support regional and local organizations that are alleviating COVID-19 worst defects around the world. It's part of our commitment to looking out for one another as well as for our communities. With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. I think my first question. My first question is for Bob, you mentioned when you come out of things like this, there's always big changes. Can you give us any initial thoughts on what you think the potential positive as well as the potential negative implications for your business long-term are that you see right now?\nBob Sulentic: I can, Tony. So, I'm going to start with industrial space. Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices. Our best guess is that there'll be more working from home and less dense use of office, lots of services provided to get to that state of affairs. And sometimes when you can't figure out what's going to happen, you look for clues, we think a good analogy is what happened in the last three years before COVID-19 when there was an intense move toward alternative workplace in office space around the world. And one of the big concerns about that was that occupiers were going to be able to use 65%, 70%, 75% of the space that they had previously occupied. That, in fact, happened. But it also created for ourselves and our competitors, one of the biggest opportunities we've seen in years as there was a lot of opportunity to do new leasing, reconfigure space, et cetera. So we're going to watch what happens with our office space. We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex space. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites type high-quality with real data security very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in offices, and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens. We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And on the outsourcing side, you gave a little color on just potential pressure points there. But do you think the EBITDA from that business still grows in 2020? Or is there just too many pressure points at this point for that to go up?\nLeah Stearns: So Tony, it's Leah. We're not giving explicit guidance around EBITDA for the business. But I would say that we do expect, just given the tailwind of new contract wins from 2019, we do believe revenue will grow. I think we're just being cautious given the fact that the operational conditions that exist around COVID-19 and our desire to manage and be prepared to accelerate out of this, we may take on some costs that otherwise we would not have. And so we just want to have the ability to manage through this in a more agile way then I think if we committed today that EBITDA would grow, we wouldn't be able to do that.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then last one for me. The GSE business are more specifically the Fannie stuff, you mentioned maybe some capital needs in the near term. Can you put any numbers around that? And also whether or not you've started to take any reserves for any potential loss sharing?\nLeah Stearns: Sure. So maybe just to start, with the CECL adoption at one-one, we did increase our reserve for our loan losses by about $15 million as of one-one, and that's on the balance sheet. We did take an incremental $5 million reserve on top of that through the P&L. So you'll see that in our results. We have not normalized for that. But Fannie, as it relates to the loan loss reserve and any potential funding for forbearance is fairly minimal. We actually have a very strong portfolio of loans in that part of our business, and we don't see that as having a material impact on our overall cash position.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, got it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Green with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Green: Good morning. Thank you. On the sales and leasing figure being down 40% in April, just curious what activity you're still seeing in the marketplace? And specifically, what was activity like for new leases and asset sales?\nLeah Stearns: So, I'll take sales, and I'll let Bob speak to leasing activity. But with respect to sales, there were certainly some assets that were in the pipeline where terms had already been set and so certain activity has come through. With respect to industrial and logistics, that continues to be an asset class, where we're seeing strength and activity continues. The issue for slowing down that has been the primary hurdle for folks has been around inspections, on-site tours. And those are things that we would expect as shelter in place orders are lifted. We would be able to address. And in addition, we've used technology to provide more virtual visual access to space so that folks can continue doing diligence as needed.\nBob Sulentic: Yes, Jason, as it relates to leasing, it's really a similar scenario to what Leah described for sales. First of all, it's heavily impacted by the fact that you can't get out and show space. Nobody's figured out how to get around that yet. And we of course, we've only been at it for a couple of months. So we completed transactions that were in the pipeline. And we, of course, have a significant base of our transactions that are renewals, and I think historically, that's been about 30% of our leasing, so that continued. But there is definitely a big impact on leasing when you can't go look at the space. And when people just have huge uncertainty in general about how long this COVID-19 thing is going to go. So we saw the downward pressure to the degree that we had described, it was down 40%, and we're going to wait and see how that plays out from here.\nJason Green: Got it. And then maybe just on the capital allocation side. You did about $50 million of repurchases in the quarter, and you're sitting about 20% below where you repurchased those shares. I guess, should we expect that you're still in the market for your shares given that price decline, or is thinking changed since you repurchased in Q1?\nLeah Stearns: Sure. So the 10b5-1 plan that we had in place in Q1 was designed really to take advantage of volatile markets and I certainly think the volatility that we saw was more pronounced than what we had expected when the plan was put in place. And so it was actually executed fairly quickly in March. So as a result of that, we typically, for our programmatic share repurchase program, which effectively offsets our stock-based compensation expense, look to do that over the course of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate that. For Q2, I would just say, we're putting a premium on liquidity. We believe the visibility that we'll have into the second half of the year as the next two months unfold will be critical to our assessment in terms of future opportunity for capital allocation and the deployment of our excess liquidity. And so we are going to take a pause just in Q2 to ensure that we're able to have that visibility and how the year unfolds, and we'll look to reassess in August.\nJason Green: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Lamers with William Blair. Please proceed with your question\nJosh Lamers: Wanted to touch on GWS. You noted some implementation delays within the service line over the near term. So, I'm wondering if you also expect any the in-person restrictions presently to limit any new client sales as well. Or to what extent are you able to currently bid on new contracts during this time?\nLeah Stearns: So, we're actually seeing those proposals and RFP processes continue. We're having day-long scoping sessions with clients so presume, but it becomes more complicated when there are shelter in place orders so that our teams can't get out and actually fully implement the on-boarding of those new accounts. So, we aren't seeing a slowdown in terms of discussions or activity as it relates to bringing on or assessing new clients' RFPs or expansion or scope discussions. It really is just the operational complexity of us not being mobile.\nJosh Lamers: And then, I understand that, as more recently, the focus is going to be on liquidity. But to start the year, you made a series of some smaller hardline SMM acquisitions. And so I'm just wondering if the current environment has changed your M&A strategy and whether or not you're getting more inbounds from a certain service line versus another?\nBob Sulentic: Josh, our M&A strategy really hasn't changed. Like everything else we're doing, it's kind of slowed down in the immediate period that we're going through as people try to figure out what they're going to do with their businesses, etcetera. People are very preoccupied by and distracted by COVID-19. No matter what else we would say. It's just a fact they're preoccupied and distracted. But our strategy for M&A remains the same, and we see the same kind of opportunities we saw before. We'll probably because of the relative strength of our balance sheet and some pressure that people might be underweight could see more opportunities. But the way you should think about CBRE's M&A strategies to look at the Telford deal. It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge a lot of market presence and other things. And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our three segments going forward, and we're not pushing any one segment more or less than the others. We're asking each of them to look for opportunities to build their business with M&A, where those businesses we buy can do more on the CBRE platform than they could do on their own or on another platform. We're encouraged that those opportunities will arise.\nJosh Lamers : Okay. Last one for me. I'm wondering if you're seeing any increased competition within the commercial mortgage space. Are you participating in some of the refinance activity? And additionally, has a drop in mortgage rates recently? I guess, the rate on some of this paper, it caused any liquidity to dry up within the CMBS market? Or are you still seeing activity there?\nLeah Stearns : So, we aren't seeing a real shift in terms of the competitive landscape on the mortgage origination front. We are we have a significant position as it relates to origination for the GSEs, and that has certainly been a major part of our underlying DSF business. But from a CMBS perspective, the GSEs have a liquidity role to play in the market. And so we're continuing to see them provide liquidity. What we are seeing though is there are higher or more restrictive covenants around underlying liquidity reserves for borrowers. And so that is slowing some of the activity. But overall, I would say, CMBS has been fairly moderate or modest in terms of new issuance, just as the market has begun to stabilize. So we're not seeing a significant it's not really coming from a competitive environment change. It's really just the overall availability of lending liquidity.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question\nJade Rahmani: Thanks very much. Nice to hear from all of you and hope everyone the safe and healthy Starting with liquidity, I was wondering if you believe the 331 cash position to be sufficient or if you anticipate in the near-term drawing down any additional reserves on the revolver?\nLeah Stearns: So we believe our liquidity is a sound position to maintain liquidity includes our cash balances, and we may increase that slightly over time, but you're not going to see us preemptively draw down significantly under our revolvers. We have a very strong bank group. We feel confident that they will be there for us. And we don't think it's prudent to go ahead and draw down at this time. We have our largest cash use for the year in Q1.  We've gotten through that, and we typically see cash build through the rest of the year. So we'll continue to manage our cash flows with a very significant focus on working capital. We had a really good quarter from overall working capital trends, and that was really as a result of our leadership team and our management being highly focused on that. We're working through some additional process and system enhancements to make that more structured and systematic. And so I think we're in a great position from an overall liquidity standpoint and don't see any need to increase our cash position at this time.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. So on the revolver, there are no approvals that you think could be subject to any market changes based on if the environment were to further deteriorate, say, for example, in July when unemployment insurance runs out, if there's a further downtick in economic trends?\nLeah Stearns: No.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. And with respect to cash flow from operations, just looking back historically, during most of the financial crisis, the company remained in positive cash generation, and it sounds like you expect that to be the case. Just your comments on cash flow for the rest of the year being positive.\nLeah Stearns: So again, we're not giving quantitative guidance, but I can tell you qualitatively, we are highly focused on receivables. We're focused on managing working capital closely. We recognize that, that is certainly a key component of getting through this uncertain time. And so our finance organization and our business leadership are partnering together to make sure that, that level of focus and importance is being placed on that.\nJade Rahmani: I was wondering if you were seeing any green shoots in early May. There's been some positive commentary in, for example, the affordable housing space about a recent uptick in rent collections. Wondering if you're seeing any green shoots across other aspects of the business?\nJade Rahmani: We're monitoring a lot of different factors. I think for May, it's just a little too early to declare any specific trend as being one to emerge. So at this point, I'll try away from specifically addressing any specific item for May, but we are certainly watching external as well as internal factors to give us more confidence in terms of certain trends that may be evolving toward a near-term resolution of the current environment?\nJade Rahmani : Okay. On the multifamily loan loss reserve, you noted a $5 million increase in the reserve post the initial CECL reserve as a result of COVID-19, which seems somewhat modest. And I was wondering if you anticipate sequential increases in reserves going forward as perhaps the full potential economic impact becomes more clear.\nLeah Stearns : So we have spent an incredible amount of time on our loan loss reserve position. We feel very good about where we are. That is certainly something that will grow over time as our loan book increases. We have a very solid base of loans that we currently have in that portion of our overall portfolio. They have a strong debt service coverage ratio of about 1.9. We have a strong loan-to-value of about 65%. So we feel very good about where we are from a reserve perspective. I think if you go back to the GFC and assume the default levels that occurred then, we have a reserve that would be positioned in excess of what the losses would accumulate to be at the GFC level. So we feel very good about where we are. From an overall perspective, we've also seen very limited our requests for forbearance, we've seen less than 1% of what could be required to fund request to be funded so far. So again, I think we feel very good about where we are and that the quality of the loan book that we're currently sitting with today is in a solid position.\nJade Rahmani : Okay. Turning to GWS. I was wondering if you could comment on the customer that made the decision to move management in-house. Is that a one-off situation? What kind of property type and customer was that? And what drove the customers thinking?\nLeah Stearns : Sure. It was a portion of the contract. It wasn't the full relationship. It was a retail client, and it was one that was using our FacilitySource platform. So we are very focused on making sure that we continue to invest in facility sources to make sure that we have the appropriate technology platform and other components of the on-demand model positioned to serve the needs of all of our clients. I think this was just a very unique case. Again, this has not happened previously, where there may have just been some disconnect in terms of what our client wanted, and how it was executed. And so we're taking this time, particularly given the slower environment as it relates to onboarding clients to really focus on improving processes and making sure we're making those investments to really come out of this in a stronger position.\nJade Rahmani : And lastly, I wanted to ask about Hana. If you could quantify the aggregate amount of investment that's been made, particularly what's currently on the balance sheet and if there's any risk of impairment or writedown of that going forward as the outlook for flex workspace may change? Or maybe you could contrast Hana's business to other co-working business models.\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Jade, this is Bob. Our expense for Hana last year was around $40 million. I believe this year, we're going to bring that down some because we've slowed the rate upon which we're adding new Hanas. We thought we'd get to 20 this year, we'll probably get to 10. In terms of the prospects for that, I mentioned earlier, we think that Hana gives us a very good option on what might happen in the flex space market. We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens. We also believe that there's a real chance, and we're in discussions with some landlords on this that landlords that want to control flex space in their own buildings, high-quality, flex space, suites oriented, we're going to want to have somebody white label that for them because they do not want to try to build the infrastructure themselves to operate it. They just they aren't going to have the scale to do that. So we're hopeful that, that could be one of the good opportunities for us coming out of the COVID-19 situation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Funk with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nAngela Zhao: Good morning, guys. It's Angela Zhao on for Mike Fung from BofA. A couple, if I may. First, what have you seen with transaction-based activity since the end of 1Q? Any color on what you've seen so far? And another thing is, what percentage would you say of the deals are being canceled?\nLeah Stearns : So, we're still assessing the overall pipeline. So, I would say, post Q1, I can't speak to the specific percentage that have been canceled because some may just be on hold. But overall, in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had about a 40% decline in overall transaction revenue. In across our leasing and sales business. Across the rest of the world because we do have a highly diversified footprint, EMEA and APAC, some markets are coming back online. So North Asia is seeing strength, whereas we certainly saw some softness to not at such an extreme extent as the U.S., but a softer environment in Continental Europe and the U.K. So I would just say it's a bit of a mixed bag outside of the U.S., but we certainly saw a significant reduction on the transactional side in the U.S. and really, it's hard to tell how many of them are truly canceled because many clients at this point are still contemplating what their move is going to be once they see greater transparency around how the economy and they are coming out of the COVID situation.\nAngela Zhao: One more, if I could. What assumptions do you use in your loan loss?\nLeah Stearns: Well, again, it goes back to the probability of loss associated with the overall transaction. So, when we look at the loan loss, we have assessed our view on the overall default rates, the quality of the portfolio and our forecast in terms of underlying growth and the underlying growth of the property NOIs based on what is sitting in the loan portfolio at this time. So, because, as I said before, we have about a 1.9 DSR DSCR coverage ratio for the loans that are in that portfolio as well as a very low loan-to-value. We feel very good about the underwriting standards and the quality that sits in those portfolios today. And so we feel very good about where we are relative to our position.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Stay healthy, and we look forward to being with you at the end of the second quarter when we talk again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentleman this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. We hope all of you are coping with COVID-19's many disruptions, and we wish you and your families' good health during this very difficult time. We are encouraged by the emerging signs that COVID-19 is being brought under control and early moves by some governments to reopen parts of their economies. We hope this progress can continue, and we extend our thanks to everyone on the front lines of the battle with this disease. With the global economy in a recession today, the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen CBRE have prepared us well for the current environment. Compared with the global financial crisis, we have a stronger market position across our business lines, a more diversified and contractual revenue base. A significantly stronger balance sheet with markedly more liquidity and a leadership team that is far better equipped to manage our cost structure. As the impact of COVID-19 began to emerge, we moved aggressively in early to take out nonessential costs. In early April, I decided to forgo my salary and our top executive leaders also agreed to meaningfully reduce their compensation. While these moves do not materially impact our financials, they create a precedent that allows us to take on other difficult actions to adjust our workforce to reflect lower levels of client demand. These moves include some job eliminations, but mostly consist of furloughs and reduced work schedules, giving us flexibility to bring back staff as needed when business activity resumes. The coming quarters will no doubt be challenging for our industry. In light of how suddenly and severely, economic growth has collapsed, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact across every part of our business, which Leah will cover in her remarks. Notably, we moved 100% of our people who work from CBRE offices in the U.S. to working from home on the night of March 13. This seamless transition confirmed the scalability of our digital and technology infrastructure and the adaptability of our workforce. Every substantial downturn creates fundamental changes in the way that commercial real estate is designed, developed, financed and used. I will cite five examples that occurred in the aftermath of the great financial crisis. First, e-commerce catalyzed a sharp increase in warehouse and logistics space utilization. Second, demand exploded for institutionally managed multifamily housing. Third, the growth of real estate outsourcing accelerated as companies pursued greater cost efficiencies. Fourth, an increased emphasis on the office occupancy experience drove demand for leasing and related project services. And finally, property ownership became much more institutional with well capitalized investors depending on third-party firms to manage, lease, value, finance and monetize these assets. CBRE benefited in a big way from each of these trends, which taken together, had a major impact on our decade-long record of robust growth. COVID-19 is likely to bring about equally powerful changes to our sector, and we believe CBRE is again well positioned for our industry's next evolution. Given our strong balance sheet and industry-leading market position, we are poised to withstand the negative impacts of COVID-19, while also remaining very focused on identifying and capitalizing on potential long-term growth catalysts that will emerge from this crisis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Leah. Thanks, Leah. Before we conclude this morning's call, I'll take a few minutes to highlight ways that CBRE's business activities for clients are producing social good. We know this is of great importance to many of our shareholders because they tell us so on a regular basis. And with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need has never been more urgent. CBRE teams around the world have been going to extraordinary links to serve our clients as they react to the demands of COVID-19.  In Spain, our team worked with our client, the Hospital Del Mar to convert the Hotel Barcelona Princess into an extension of the hospital. The 363 room field hospital opened on April one and serves more than 200 COVID-19 patients. CBRE's on-site technicians provided essential maintenance and installation services to keep the field hospital running. In the U.K., we supported our client National Exhibition Center in the creation of its Birmingham Nightingale field hospital for COVID-19 patients. The first phase of the hospital opened on April 16, our team delivered essential materials and services and provides ongoing maintenance of the hospital. In Atlanta, our project management team worked with our client, Piedmont Healthcare to move up the opening of the patient floors in a new building under construction by more than three months to create more capacity as the hospital prepared for potentially higher admissions due to COVID-19. While many of our people have been working remotely, we have some 40,000 professionals like the ones highlighted here who have been working at client locations to keep properties operational and essential projects moving forward. They are among the unsung heroes of the COVID-19 crisis, and we salute them. We also recognize that COVID-19 has caused significant hardship for some of our CBRE people. In response, we have set aside $5 million of our more than $15 million COVID-19 relief fund to help colleagues who have fallen on hard times. The fund's remaining $10 million is dedicated to support regional and local organizations that are alleviating COVID-19 worst defects around the world. It's part of our commitment to looking out for one another as well as for our communities. With that, operator, we'll open the lines for questions. I can, Tony. So, I'm going to start with industrial space. Clearly, we have a very big industrial business. We develop it, we sell it, we manage it, we finance it. And everything that's about COVID-19 that's driving e-commerce will drive the use of industrial space, and that will be an opportunity. We think multifamily will continue to grow around the world. We develop it. We finance it. We sell it. And we've got this new business in the U.K. that while in the short run, is under pressure, Telford, because of what's going on, there's going to be a real secular push for institutionally managed multifamily there. Office space is going to be a little confusing. In the short run, there's going to be a lot of discovery about working from home versus working in offices.

We also think there's going to be something that goes on in the middle between what happens at home and what happens in multi-tenant buildings with flex space. It's not going to be co-working as we've known it with membership type circumstances, but we think suites type high-quality with real data security very professionally managed is going to be quite attractive to some subset of occupiers as they serve their people working from home, maybe smaller populations, permanent populations in offices, and our Hana product, we think, is well positioned to take advantage of that if that happens. We very much like the positioning of that product, which is suites oriented. So those are some of the things that could happen. There will be other things outsourcing will almost inevitably accelerate because of the intense focus on cost control that corporations have. We will benefit from that. So we're watching all these things, and there'll be some things happen that we can't see as we sit here right now. Yes, Jason, as it relates to leasing, it's really a similar scenario to what Leah described for sales. First of all, it's heavily impacted by the fact that you can't get out and show space. Nobody's figured out how to get around that yet. And we of course, we've only been at it for a couple of months. So we completed transactions that were in the pipeline. And we, of course, have a significant base of our transactions that are renewals, and I think historically, that's been about 30% of our leasing, so that continued. But there is definitely a big impact on leasing when you can't go look at the space. And when people just have huge uncertainty in general about how long this COVID-19 thing is going to go. So we saw the downward pressure to the degree that we had described, it was down 40%, and we're going to wait and see how that plays out from here. Josh, our M&A strategy really hasn't changed. Like everything else we're doing, it's kind of slowed down in the immediate period that we're going through as people try to figure out what they're going to do with their businesses, etcetera. People are very preoccupied by and distracted by COVID-19. No matter what else we would say. It's just a fact they're preoccupied and distracted. But our strategy for M&A remains the same, and we see the same kind of opportunities we saw before. We'll probably because of the relative strength of our balance sheet and some pressure that people might be underweight could see more opportunities. But the way you should think about CBRE's M&A strategies to look at the Telford deal. It was an opportunity to take advantage of the brand we have, the capabilities we have, the balance sheet we have to go into a market where we hadn't been before and build a capability that was very much in line with the secular trend where we had a lot of knowledge a lot of market presence and other things. And it was a great size bet for us with the assumption of that $440 million, and it made our business materially stronger. You should expect to see us do that across our three segments going forward, and we're not pushing any one segment more or less than the others. We're asking each of them to look for opportunities to build their business with M&A, where those businesses we buy can do more on the CBRE platform than they could do on their own or on another platform. We're encouraged that those opportunities will arise. Yes. Jade, this is Bob. Our expense for Hana last year was around $40 million. I believe this year, we're going to bring that down some because we've slowed the rate upon which we're adding new Hanas. We thought we'd get to 20 this year, we'll probably get to 10. In terms of the prospects for that, I mentioned earlier, we think that Hana gives us a very good option on what might happen in the flex space market. We do believe the flex space market is going to be real. It's going to be important to landlords. We're spending a lot of time with our big occupiers. We know they're going to want some of that capability in their portfolio. It's going to be different than what most of the flex space market has been historically. Much of it's been around the membership model, individuals or small groups in shared space. Hana from day one has been a suite product. Hana from day one has been higher quality, less dense, very strong on data security. We think it's a product that very likely could play quite well going forward. Of course, we're going to have to watch and see what happens. We also believe that there's a real chance, and we're in discussions with some landlords on this that landlords that want to control flex space in their own buildings, high-quality, flex space, suites oriented, we're going to want to have somebody white label that for them because they do not want to try to build the infrastructure themselves to operate it. They just they aren't going to have the scale to do that. So we're hopeful that, that could be one of the good opportunities for us coming out of the COVID-19 situation. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. Stay healthy, and we look forward to being with you at the end of the second quarter when we talk again."

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Turning to slide eight. Our Advisory Services segment grew fee revenue about 5%, while adjusted EBITDA rose nearly 11%. Advisory adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue increased 100 basis points to 17.5%. The segment's sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. For most of our markets, COVID-19 did not have a material impact until mid-March. In January and February, our U.S. sales and leasing businesses posted healthy gains, but revenue declined by mid-teens in March. In April, U.S. sales and leasing revenue declined over 40% from April 2019 levels. Across the rest of our transactional business, declines were more muted due to its diversified geographic footprint. In response to these trends, we have taken decisive action to temporarily lower costs within our transactional business through furloughs of non-revenue-generating staff as well as reduced nonessential costs such as promotional and travel and entertainment expenses. Despite these late quarter pressures, revenue growth for our property sales business rose by 12% during Q1, which was a new all-time high for CBRE in first quarter property sales revenue. Growth was led by North Asia, as strength in Japan offset weakness in Greater China, and in Continental Europe, where our largest market, France and Germany delivered double-digit revenue gains. In the U.S., property sales revenue was up 3%. The increase was tempered by a decline in average deal size. During the quarter and continuing the trend we saw emerge in late 2019, leasing revenue slipped by 2% on both a global basis and in our largest market, the U.S. This decline reflects very tough comparisons with Q1 2019 when recent growth was more than 20% globally and 28% in the U.S. Like the prior two quarters, activity with co-working providers lowered U.S. leasing growth by about 3%. Certain advisory segment revenues were less impacted by COVID-19 in Q1, including our loan servicing, valuations and Property Management businesses. During the quarter, these lines of business accounted for approximately 22% of the advisory segment revenues and delivered 8% revenue growth.  Turning to slide nine. Our Global Workplace Solutions segment grew growth and fee revenue by approximately 18% and 17%, respectively. Fee revenue rose 20% in facilities management and nearly 16% in Project Management. We had our best quarter ever for contract renewals with a rate that was once again over 90%, and we secured new business with large high-quality clients in the transportation and logistics and life sciences sectors. Adjusted EBITDA was flat with the prior year period. This primarily reflected a write down of receivables due to a contract settlement with a client, which reduced the adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment by 110 basis points. There were also some other items such as a shift to lower margin facilities management and COVID-related expenses that also weighed on the margin. Since the emergence of COVID-19, our GWS team has been highly focused on helping our clients navigate this challenging situation and enhancing our long-term partnerships, which Bob will discuss in his closing remarks.  Turning to slide 10. Let's now look at our Real Estate Investment segment, where adjusted EBITDA fell 56% year-over-year to $38 million. This primarily was driven by a $27 million decline in co-investment returns provided by our public securities business, reflecting the sharp equity market sell-off at the end of the quarter. We also faced a tough comparison for large development asset sales, which were particularly strong in Q1 2019. Activity in our development business started 2020 strong with several deals, which we had expected to close in late Q4, being completed within the first 30 days of the year. Later in the quarter and partially attributable to the early impact of COVID-19, we saw further delays in development transactions. Importantly, these declines were partially offset by our Investment Management business, which saw continued growth in recurring revenue, which climbed 7% over prior year and contributed $20 million and adjusted EBITDA, over 50% of this segment's total in the quarter. Finally, investment in the start-up of our enterprise-focused flexible workspace business, Hana, subtracted about $9 million from adjusted EBITDA.  Looking at Slide 11. Let's now take a look at our 2020 outlook. Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we have withdrawn our explicit EPS guidance for the year and will instead provide qualitative commentary for each of our business segments. In Advisory, we expect a significant drop in revenue from our two largest business lines, leasing and property sales. That will outpace the decline in economic activity. As I highlighted previously, April's sales and leasing revenue in the U.S. contracted severely and the timing and the velocity of any recovery is highly dependent on the trajectory of the containment of COVID-19 as well as the recovery of consumer and business sentiments. Additionally, while our business is geographically diverse, the U.S. and U.K. comprise more than 70% of our global leasing and property sales revenue in 2019. We also expect loan origination volumes to decline due to continued economic uncertainty, which will weigh on loan servicing revenue. We will also need to support modest liquidity requirements necessitated by the GSE's rent forbearance, specifically for Fannie Mae, which comprises about 12% of our loan servicing portfolio.  Thus far, a dominiums number of borrowers have been approved for forbearance, and this has not had a material impact on our business to date. Lastly, about two-three of the cost of sales in our advisory business is variable in nature as commissions decline in steps with transaction volumes. This should help to support our margins in this segment as cost of sales comprise the majority of our total costs in advisory. Moving to GWS, where revenue is generated from multiyear contracts. We expect this segment to be relatively resilient and continue to expect positive revenue growth, albeit at a rate lower than our original expectations. As the pandemic creates pressures not seen in previous downturns, largely stemming from logistical challenges. Our expectations for growth in GWS reflects the in-year impact of our new business secured in 2019, which is being partially offset by the operational challenges and on boarding new clients as a result of the current shelter in place orders. In addition, we are absorbing certain COVID-19 costs within our GWS business to ensure we are fully prepared to support our clients as they reopen their business locations. In addition, while infrequent, we have experienced business upsets on certain GWS client accounts.  Given the slower pace of growth expected in 2020, we are focused on improving our business processes to ensure we are ready to accelerate growth when business conditions rebound. We continue to believe that our outsourcing business is positioned to benefit from challenging economic conditions, offering clients more efficient and cost-effective facility solutions. We expect Project Management, which comprises about 12% of our GWS Segment revenue to see near-term pressures as clients delay some work. Looking at REI. We believe this business segment is positioned to perform more resiliently than in previous recessions. Our development business is in a relatively strong position with conservatively financed projects, stable equity partners, and a pipeline that is heavily weighted toward core industrial and logistics projects as well as office properties that are about 80% pre-leased. Nonetheless, the pace of development asset dispositions will continue to slow in the near-term as we and our equity partners are not under pressure to monetize assets quickly. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA in Investment Management is highly recurring, as I mentioned earlier, and we expect the impact of co-investments to ease over time as we reduce our exposure to publicly traded securities. As you would expect, we've also started to incur costs directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, which totaled around $3 million in Q1. These costs are expected to increase as we prepare offices for the return of our employees, incur incremental compensation for certain employees required to work on-site and enhance safety training. Lastly, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the dislocation in the flexible workspace market, and have positioned Hana to serve enterprise clients that desire private workspaces. However, in the short term, we will slow the pace of expected Hana unit openings in 2020. Until we have more clarity around COVID-19 impact on occupier demand. Turning to slide 12. Our financial position is strong, we ended Q1 with just 0.6 turns of leverage, liquidity of $3.4 billion, no debt maturities until 2023 and an investment-grade credit rating. Our significant balance sheet flexibility provides us a solid foundation from which to execute our strategy. In 2020, our capital allocation will continue to prioritize internal investments in our platform and people to drive superior client outcomes and long-term growth. Our M&A strategy is focused on enhancing and differentiating our capabilities globally, and we believe that COVID-19 crisis may lead to unique and compelling opportunities. Finally, we may utilize our share repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stock-based compensation program. And on a more opportunistic basis, if we believe our stock presents an attractive investment compared with other discretionary uses. While the current situation is highly uncertain, we're confident that we've enhanced the resiliency of our business and our capital structure to build upon our industry leadership position. In addition, our senior leadership team is taking decisive action to identify opportunities to further differentiate CBRE and position the business to accelerate once we are more certain of an economic recovery. With that, I'll ask you to turn to slide 13, as Bob provides a few closing thoughts. So Tony, it's Leah. We're not giving explicit guidance around EBITDA for the business. But I would say that we do expect, just given the tailwind of new contract wins from 2019, we do believe revenue will grow. I think we're just being cautious given the fact that the operational conditions that exist around COVID-19 and our desire to manage and be prepared to accelerate out of this, we may take on some costs that otherwise we would not have. And so we just want to have the ability to manage through this in a more agile way then I think if we committed today that EBITDA would grow, we wouldn't be able to do that. Sure. So maybe just to start, with the CECL adoption at one-one, we did increase our reserve for our loan losses by about $15 million as of one-one, and that's on the balance sheet. We did take an incremental $5 million reserve on top of that through the P&L. So you'll see that in our results. We have not normalized for that. But Fannie, as it relates to the loan loss reserve and any potential funding for forbearance is fairly minimal. We actually have a very strong portfolio of loans in that part of our business, and we don't see that as having a material impact on our overall cash position. So, I'll take sales, and I'll let Bob speak to leasing activity. But with respect to sales, there were certainly some assets that were in the pipeline where terms had already been set and so certain activity has come through. With respect to industrial and logistics, that continues to be an asset class, where we're seeing strength and activity continues. The issue for slowing down that has been the primary hurdle for folks has been around inspections, on-site tours. And those are things that we would expect as shelter in place orders are lifted. We would be able to address. And in addition, we've used technology to provide more virtual visual access to space so that folks can continue doing diligence as needed. Sure. So the 10b5-1 plan that we had in place in Q1 was designed really to take advantage of volatile markets and I certainly think the volatility that we saw was more pronounced than what we had expected when the plan was put in place. And so it was actually executed fairly quickly in March. So as a result of that, we typically, for our programmatic share repurchase program, which effectively offsets our stock-based compensation expense, look to do that over the course of the year, and we'll continue to evaluate that. For Q2, I would just say, we're putting a premium on liquidity. We believe the visibility that we'll have into the second half of the year as the next two months unfold will be critical to our assessment in terms of future opportunity for capital allocation and the deployment of our excess liquidity. And so we are going to take a pause just in Q2 to ensure that we're able to have that visibility and how the year unfolds, and we'll look to reassess in August. So, we're actually seeing those proposals and RFP processes continue. We're having day-long scoping sessions with clients so presume, but it becomes more complicated when there are shelter in place orders so that our teams can't get out and actually fully implement the on-boarding of those new accounts. So, we aren't seeing a slowdown in terms of discussions or activity as it relates to bringing on or assessing new clients' RFPs or expansion or scope discussions. It really is just the operational complexity of us not being mobile. So, we aren't seeing a real shift in terms of the competitive landscape on the mortgage origination front. We are we have a significant position as it relates to origination for the GSEs, and that has certainly been a major part of our underlying DSF business. But from a CMBS perspective, the GSEs have a liquidity role to play in the market. And so we're continuing to see them provide liquidity. What we are seeing though is there are higher or more restrictive covenants around underlying liquidity reserves for borrowers. And so that is slowing some of the activity. But overall, I would say, CMBS has been fairly moderate or modest in terms of new issuance, just as the market has begun to stabilize. So we're not seeing a significant it's not really coming from a competitive environment change. It's really just the overall availability of lending liquidity. So we believe our liquidity is a sound position to maintain liquidity includes our cash balances, and we may increase that slightly over time, but you're not going to see us preemptively draw down significantly under our revolvers. We have a very strong bank group. We feel confident that they will be there for us. And we don't think it's prudent to go ahead and draw down at this time. We have our largest cash use for the year in Q1.  We've gotten through that, and we typically see cash build through the rest of the year. So we'll continue to manage our cash flows with a very significant focus on working capital. We had a really good quarter from overall working capital trends, and that was really as a result of our leadership team and our management being highly focused on that. We're working through some additional process and system enhancements to make that more structured and systematic. And so I think we're in a great position from an overall liquidity standpoint and don't see any need to increase our cash position at this time. No. So again, we're not giving quantitative guidance, but I can tell you qualitatively, we are highly focused on receivables. We're focused on managing working capital closely. We recognize that, that is certainly a key component of getting through this uncertain time. And so our finance organization and our business leadership are partnering together to make sure that, that level of focus and importance is being placed on that. So we have spent an incredible amount of time on our loan loss reserve position. We feel very good about where we are. That is certainly something that will grow over time as our loan book increases. We have a very solid base of loans that we currently have in that portion of our overall portfolio. They have a strong debt service coverage ratio of about 1.9. We have a strong loan-to-value of about 65%. So we feel very good about where we are from a reserve perspective. I think if you go back to the GFC and assume the default levels that occurred then, we have a reserve that would be positioned in excess of what the losses would accumulate to be at the GFC level. So we feel very good about where we are. From an overall perspective, we've also seen very limited our requests for forbearance, we've seen less than 1% of what could be required to fund request to be funded so far. So again, I think we feel very good about where we are and that the quality of the loan book that we're currently sitting with today is in a solid position. Sure. It was a portion of the contract. It wasn't the full relationship. It was a retail client, and it was one that was using our FacilitySource platform. So we are very focused on making sure that we continue to invest in facility sources to make sure that we have the appropriate technology platform and other components of the on-demand model positioned to serve the needs of all of our clients. I think this was just a very unique case. Again, this has not happened previously, where there may have just been some disconnect in terms of what our client wanted, and how it was executed. And so we're taking this time, particularly given the slower environment as it relates to onboarding clients to really focus on improving processes and making sure we're making those investments to really come out of this in a stronger position. So, we're still assessing the overall pipeline. So, I would say, post Q1, I can't speak to the specific percentage that have been canceled because some may just be on hold. But overall, in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had about a 40% decline in overall transaction revenue. In across our leasing and sales business. Across the rest of the world because we do have a highly diversified footprint, EMEA and APAC, some markets are coming back online. So North Asia is seeing strength, whereas we certainly saw some softness to not at such an extreme extent as the U.S., but a softer environment in Continental Europe and the U.K. So I would just say it's a bit of a mixed bag outside of the U.S., but we certainly saw a significant reduction on the transactional side in the U.S. and really, it's hard to tell how many of them are truly canceled because many clients at this point are still contemplating what their move is going to be once they see greater transparency around how the economy and they are coming out of the COVID situation. Well, again, it goes back to the probability of loss associated with the overall transaction. So, when we look at the loan loss, we have assessed our view on the overall default rates, the quality of the portfolio and our forecast in terms of underlying growth and the underlying growth of the property NOIs based on what is sitting in the loan portfolio at this time. So, because, as I said before, we have about a 1.9 DSR DSCR coverage ratio for the loans that are in that portfolio as well as a very low loan-to-value. We feel very good about the underwriting standards and the quality that sits in those portfolios today. And so we feel very good about where we are relative to our position."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to CBRE's Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn over the conference to your host, Kristyn Farahmand, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance, CBRE. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including our 2022 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, the performance of existing investments, financial performance, including cash flow, profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS, core adjusted EPS and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration and performance of acquisitions and other transactions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only, and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of core adjusted EPS, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our new financial metrics. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, will discuss initiatives that support our 4-dimension diversification strategy. Then Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial and Investment Officer, will discuss the quarter in detail our capital deployment strategy, our initial qualitative 2022 outlook and our updated multiyear growth framework, then we'll open up the call for questions. As you can see on Slide 5, the fourth quarter completed a strong and transformative year for CBRE. We made strategic investments in Turner & Townsend and Industrious and saw significant gains from strategic noncore investments made through our SPAC and in venture capital funds. Due to our controlling interest that results from our 60% ownership stake in Turner & Townsend, we fully consolidate Turner & Townsend's financials, including their balance sheet. We will focus our commentary on consolidated performance inclusive of noncontrolling interests, and we will use consolidated adjusted EBITDA for our net leverage calculations. To give more transparency to our investors, we are introducing a new earnings metric called core adjusted EPS this quarter. Core adjusted EPS excludes the impact of strategic noncore, noncontrolling investments that are not attributable to a business segment. These had an immaterial impact prior to 2021. These investments are a small part of our portfolio, but there is likely to be considerable volatility in their fair values, particularly for Altus Power, the largest of our investments now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. We believe this new metric will help investors better assess the underlying performance of our core business. Starting in Q1, we will also present strategic noncore investments in corporate overhead separately, which today are combined. We believe this incremental transparency will help investors assess the level of corporate overhead and the performance of these noncore investments. We've also enhanced our presentation today to help provide greater insight into our performance. As a result, the slides accompanying our remarks are different from previous quarters and focus on the most significant drivers to our consolidated results for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and earnings. The segment-specific slides we presented in previous quarters are included in the appendix, as are some slides from our research team detailing the long-term historical relationship between real estate and inflation that we believe investors will find topical. With that, please turn to Slide 7 as Bob provides insight into our strategy. Bob?\nRobert Sulentic: Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a strong finish to 2021 significantly outperforming both Q4 2020 and the pre-pandemic peak in Q4 2019. This capped an outstanding year for CBRE with all key financial benchmarks reaching new all-time highs for the company. We certainly benefited from a supportive macro environment in 2021. Beyond that, our strong financial performance is the product of our long-standing work to strengthen our balance sheet and improve the resiliency of our income statement as well as our successful efforts over the past several years to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset types, lines of business, clients and geographies. We have described our diversification efforts in detail in recent quarters, highlighting how it has positioned CBRE to benefit significantly from secular tailwinds. Prime examples of this are our investments in Turner & Townsend, a project manager that enhances our green energy and infrastructure capabilities; and Industrious, a leading asset-light player in the growing flex space market. In our Real Estate Investments segment, we are now executing a strategy to realize positive synergies between our development and Investment Management businesses with support from our strong balance sheet. So far, this effort has focused on industrial and logistics assets which are benefiting from long-term secular trends. Our research team projects that global e-commerce sales will rise to approximately $3.9 trillion by 2025, requiring an additional 1.5 billion square feet of distribution space. Specifically, we are placing development projects into investment programs run by CBRE Investment Management, essentially converting portions of our more than $18 billion in-process development portfolio into Investment Management AUM. This strategy also capitalizes on our industrial investment sales and property management expertise. At the same time, we are further building AUM in our industrial and logistics strategy by supporting CBRE Investment Management's acquisition of large portfolios of operating assets. The most recent example is the agreement to acquire a $4.9 billion portfolio of U.S. and European logistics assets from Hillwood. Our balance sheet provided a backstop proportions of this portfolio, which enabled our team to move quickly to secure a highly desirable set of assets. We plan to replicate this model for other secularly favored asset types, including multifamily and life sciences and expect our integrated investor, operator, developer model will generate material incremental recurring revenues and earnings for years to come. Reflecting our strong 2021 performance and the substantial opportunities we see in front of us, we are increasing our multiyear aspirational growth framework. For the period from 2020 to 2025, we now expect our average annual core adjusted EPS growth to exceed 20% barring an economic disruption from geopolitical or other events, which we are watching closely. This is up from the low double-digit growth expectation we set a year ago. The average annual growth rate is expected to be in the low double digits for the prospective period from 2021 to 2025. We believe there is potential upside to our expected growth rates for both periods through incremental capital deployment. Emma will walk you through this in detail after she reviews the quarter. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob. 2021 was an outstanding year for CBRE with strong growth across our key financial metrics and record free cash flow driven by operational discipline and our 4-dimension diversification strategy. We're also well positioned for future growth, which I'll discuss shortly. Throughout my remarks today, I'll highlight how our results benefited from asset type diversification, and in future quarters, I will focus on the benefits of other diversification dimension. Now please turn to Slide 9, so we can dive into our results for the quarter. Like Q3, I'll include compares with Q4 2019 for their transactional business lines to provide insight into our performance from peak levels. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 24% compared to Q4 2020 and 20% over Q4 2019 led by rebounding sales and lease revenue. Advisory Services added nearly $1 billion in net revenue, growing 43% for Q4 2020 and 23% over Q4 2019 to over $3.3 billion, a record for our largest segment. We continued to benefit from a supportive property sales backdrop. Globally, sales revenue jumped over 73% from Q4 2020 and 45% from Q4 2019. The U.S. led the recovery among our major markets with 89% sales revenue growth compared to the prior year quarter. We had the highest market share across all major asset types in 2021, while our overall U.S. market share rose 100 basis points in the quarter according to independent data provider, Real Capital Analytics. Capital inflows into multifamily and industrial remained strong, allowing us to benefit from the very intentional work we have done to build leading sales platforms focused on these asset types. U.S. industrial sales revenue more than doubled from Q4 2019, while U.S. multifamily sales nearly doubled over the same period. Office continues to gradually improve back towards pre-pandemic levels. And our U.S. office sales revenue was around 14% shy of Q4 2019, an improvement from steeper declines in the prior quarters. Global leasing revenue rose 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 with all 3 regions ahead of 2019 levels for the second consecutive quarter. EMEA leasing revenue grew 25% on Q4 2019, and the Americas was up 13%, while APAC grew 7%. Industrial leasing surged around 60% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 as occupier demand for distribution space remains strong. Like in sales, office leasing also continued to recover with global office leasing nearly flat versus Q4 2019. EMEA and APAC office leasing rose around 7% and 11%, respectively, compared to Q4 2019. U.S. office leasing revenue trends also continued to improve. While still below its 2019 level by around 4%, the year-over-year shortfall from prior peak levels has narrowed compared to previous quarters. Notably, while it's still early in the year, we are continuing to see strong momentum in both U.S. sales and leasing thus far in 2022, with revenue trending significantly above prior peak first quarter levels. Loan servicing was the primary growth driver within the rest of advisory, with revenue rising around 70% from Q4 2019 to nearly $93 million. Our loan servicing portfolio grew 23% versus the prior year and 10% sequentially to nearly $330 billion, primarily driven by private capital sources. Our multifamily portfolio, comprising nearly half of the total, grew about 14% versus Q4 2020. Our alternative asset type portfolio, which includes agriculture, health care, hotels and others, rose over 70% and now comprises approximately 19% of our total servicing portfolio. Growth was driven by a strong pace of third-party servicing wins, which is a key focus area for growth in this business. OMSR gains faced a tough compare and were down about $47 million. These gains were elevated in last year's fourth quarter as the government agencies were extremely active in providing liquidity to a multifamily market burdened by COVID impact. Turning to GWS. Net revenue grew 22%, increasing $330 million to nearly $1.9 billion. This includes about $175 million in net revenue from the Turner & Townsend transaction, which closed on November 1 and was in line with our previous expectations. We are extremely excited about the growth trajectory for this business. Project management is a fragmented market, estimated to be over $100 billion with strong secular growth tailwinds, particularly within infrastructure. This transaction helps to bolster the nascent infrastructure capabilities within our existing businesses. We believe broadening our infrastructure offerings will help to accelerate future growth and deepen diversification, especially by helping to further insulate our business for more cyclical trends. Our legacy GWS revenue grew nearly 8% led by project management, which rose about 17%, excluding contributions from Turner & Townsend. Strong growth in project management was driven by continued recovery from the pandemic-constrained environment. Facilities Management revenue increased nearly 6%, and net revenue rose over 10% supported by growth from local clients. We expect Facilities Management growth to benefit from continued progress in returning to a more normal business environment in 2022. Looking at REI, revenue increased $125 million or 43% to over $413 million. This was driven by increasing activity in our U.K. multifamily development business, which is continuing to recover from COVID-related challenges. Investment Management revenue was relatively flat versus Q4 2020 at about $150 million due to lower carried interest revenue, which can be volatile. Excluding carried interest revenue, Investment Management revenue grew 19%, driven by strong asset management fee growth. AUM rose to a new record of nearly $142 billion with more than 80% invested in assets other than office. Industrial comprises the largest component, in line with our strategic vision to position the company to benefit from this sector's strong secular tailwinds. Flipping to Slide 10. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA grew to over $1.1 billion. Excluding noncash gains related to OMSRs, our Altus Power investment through our SPAC and venture capital investments, adjusted EBITDA grew over 37% compared to Q4 2020. On this basis, our underlying adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue rose 6 basis points versus Q4 2020 to 16.5%, which is 1.7% above our Q4 2019 level. Advisory Services segment operating profit marginally exceeded our expectations, increasing $219 million to over $740 million as sales and lease revenue rose more than expected. Advisory's net operating profit margin, excluding volatile noncash OMSR gains, reached a new record of 21.5%, about 120 basis points better than Q4 2019. We achieved this despite record productivity pushing more producers into higher split tranches. In GWS, legacy segment operating profit reflected higher-than-expected medical expenses as we saw a ramp-up in year-end insurance claims compared with 2020's severely pandemic-constrained levels as well as a $3 million impact of noncash deferred purchase consideration expense for Turner & Townsend. Turner & Townsend profitability performed in line with our expectations, contributing just over $23 million of profit from November 1 through year-end. REI segment operating profit rose $39 million to $156 million and was roughly in line with expectations as outperformance in Investment Management offset a modest shortfall in development. Investment Management benefited from higher-than-expected net promotes and co-investment returns driving operating profit to $41 million. Development operating profit of $122 million was affected by a $29 million increase in the reserve we had previously taken on a U.K. construction project that faced challenges that were exacerbated by the pandemic. We believe we have fully reserved for this project and don't expect it to result in further adverse financial impacts. Putting aside this reserve increase, development operating profit would have been over $150 million for the quarter and about $380 million for the year, surpassing our previous expectations. This was driven by the conversion of our average in-process portfolio to operating profit at a rate of over 2.1% over the trailing 12-month period, a level well above our historical norm of between 1% and 2% with most years around the midpoint. We also saw increased corporate overhead in the quarter. This is largely driven by higher incentive compensation as performance materially exceeded initial 2021 expectations and our investments in key corporate functions to help support our larger business. We do not expect incentive compensation to fluctuate as much in 2022 as business volatility continues to normalize. Looking at Slide 11, adjusted earnings per share rose 51% to $2.19. This includes a benefit of $0.36 from a gain in our SPAC investment and another $0.03 from mark-to-market adjustments on our Altus Power and VC investments. Excluding these noncash gains, core adjusted EPS rose 24% to $1.80. Excluding only the SPAC deconsolidation gain, which is consistent with how we've reported our results in previous quarters, adjusted EPS rose over 26% to $1.83. Robust underlying earnings growth reflects the strong increase in adjusted EBITDA as well as lower net interest expense. These were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, mainly related to elevated prepayments of government agency-related loans, which triggered higher OMSR amortization. Our results also include noncash interest expense related to deferred purchase consideration for our remaining Turner & Townsend payments and an increase in our effective adjusted tax rate to 23.9%. The nonrecurring reserve increase in the U.K. multifamily development business lowered earnings by approximately $0.07. Going forward, as Kristyn noted earlier, we'll report both adjusted EPS and core adjusted EPS to give you transparency into how both our core operations and noncore investments are performing. Now we'll discuss our financial capacity on Slide 12. Due to our strong profitability, we generated nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our annual free cash flow total to almost $2.2 billion, which is a new record for our company. We ended the year with a net cash position of 0.2 turn while deploying nearly $1.8 billion of capital, net of debt issuance proceeds during the year, primarily for investments in future growth. We also repurchased around $370 million of stock, providing our shareholders a repurchase yield of over 1%. We intend to continue this capital deployment strategy and believe there is ample opportunity to invest in future growth while also programmatically returning cash to our shareholders. In support of this, we commenced our fifth consecutive quarter of repurchases in Q1 2022. We intend to continue repurchases throughout this year, assuming the return remains attractive and we have capacity given our evolving M&A pipeline. Additionally, as we move forward, strong free cash flow conversion will remain a priority for us, and our senior executive team will be evaluated on this metric as part of their 2022 goals. Please turn to Slide 13. We expect another year of strong growth in 2022. Market conditions remain generally favorable, notwithstanding heightened geopolitical tensions, and tailwinds are likely to persist across the 4 dimensions of our business and areas where we are proactively investing to drive growth. Advisory Services is positioned for another year of strong revenue and segment operating profit growth, with leasing revenue expected to rise at a high teen to low 20% rate and sales revenue expected to rise at a low to mid-teens rate. We expect incremental benefit from offices gradual recovery and that industrial leasing should decelerate modestly due to a potential near-term shortage of available properties. As Bob highlighted earlier, we believe long-term secular trends are bolstering demand for industrial space and expect strong performance for this asset class on a long-run basis. Outside of sales and leasing, we expect advisory revenue to rise at a high single-digit to low double-digit clip compared to 2021. We also expect advisory's operating margin to be roughly flat versus the prior year as the benefit of high-margin transactional revenue growth will be tempered by some operating expense investments designed to accelerate future growth. Advisory operating profit expectations also include increased strategic equity awards to help better align a broader leadership team with our enterprise strategy and shareholders. We expect strong long-run margin performance in advisory, partially driven by these investments. In GWS, we expect low to mid-double-digit organic top line growth and mid- to high single-digit organic segment operating profit growth. This is being driven by continued strong growth in project management and accelerated growth in enterprise facilities management, partially driven by a return to normal contract cycle times. We expect this growth to be more weighted to the second half of the year. GWS legacy segment operating profit expectations also include the impact of $17 million of noncash deferred purchase consideration expense for Turner & Townsend. This expense will continue through 2025 when we've made the last of our required payments. We will also record about $10 million in noncash interest expense associated with our deferred payments. Like in advisory, GWS operating profit expectations also include an impact from increased use of strategic equity awards. This is reducing expected legacy segment operating profit growth by around 1%. We expect Turner & Townsend to grow net revenue at a mid-teens rate, in line with its historical average over the approximately $974 million it generated in calendar year 2021. Strong organic growth is expected to more than offset a small foreign exchange headwind at today's spot rate. Turner & Townsend net operating profit margin is projected to tick up around 0.5% from the 13.4% generated in the fourth quarter. This reflects strong top line growth, the restoration of certain expenses cut during COVID and about $10 million of noncash expense for retention bonuses. REI revenue is expected to grow around 20%, and segment operating profit is expected to roughly match the elevated operating profit of $520 million generated in 2021, excluding the $24 million accounting change-driven gain that we recorded in last year's first quarter. Revenue growth is being driven by continued recovery of our U.K. development business. Our REI expectations also contemplate elevated hiring and investment management for new product development, a key strategic focus as well as more moderate appreciation and asset values. Finally, we expect our development in-process portfolio will convert to operating profit at a rate of under 2%, in line with historical performance. Our in-process portfolio is well positioned for the current environment with nearly 80% of the portfolio comprised of industrial, multifamily, health care and life sciences assets. As you can see, we are consciously orienting the portfolio towards assets with strong long-term performance potential. Setting aside any effects of our strategic noncore investments, we expect corporate overhead to decline nearly 5% from 2021. We anticipate investments in further scaling key corporate functions to be more than offset by more favorable incentive compensation impact. Going forward, core adjusted earnings, which excludes the impact of our small portfolio of strategic noncore investments, will be the basis of our financial forecast. We are making these investments for their strategic value rather than near-term financial gains. However, there will likely be sharp volatility in their investment valuation, especially for our largest noncore investment in publicly traded Altus Power. Altus is poised to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy while enhancing capabilities to help our clients meet their clean energy and sustainability goals. As always, for investments of this nature, short-term bouts of market volatility can cause the value of our investment to swing sharply on a quarter-to-quarter basis. For example, the majority of the noncash gain we recognized in the fourth quarter would be reversed in the first quarter at Altus' share price as of February 15. Now looking at depreciation and amortization. We expect this to rise about 4%, and we project our effective adjusted tax rate to be in line with the 23.9% rate we saw in Q4 2021. We are also highly focused on monitoring how inflation could impact our business. Real estate provides a natural inflation hedge when held on a long-term basis, which somewhat cushions our transactional businesses. In fact, sales could potentially even benefit if inflation concerns draw more capital to real estate. On the expense side, clients reimburse us for the salary and benefits of nearly half of our employee base who work primarily in the GWS and property management businesses, and inflation provisions are typically embedded in our multiyear GWS contracts. In light of this, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in a higher inflation environment. It is also prudent to highlight that while the current operating environment remains favorable, there is heightened uncertainty given this higher inflationary environment, tighter monetary policy and rising geopolitical tensions. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update of our multiyear growth framework. As Bob noted, we've raised our base case annual core adjusted EPS growth expectations to more than 20% for the 2020 to 2025 period and to low double digits for the next 4 years. There is upside to both growth rates from additional capital deployment. We envision solid organic revenue and earnings growth across our 3 business segments. Our overall margin is expected to gradually increase over this period even with considerable growth from our lower-margin GWS segment. The GWS margin itself should also improve over time as higher-margin project management accounts for a larger share of our GWS revenue base. We will continue to manage our balance sheet prudently. We are comfortable with increasing net leverage to around 1 turn as we deploy capital into M&A to accelerate growth. We can even go as high as 2 turns for a highly compelling strategic opportunity. We expect to focus our capital deployment strategy on secularly favorite areas that will further diversify our business. We see significant opportunity to expand our investor, operator, developer model into multifamily, life sciences and infrastructure. Importantly, this model plays to our competitive advantages, including cross-functional collaboration, business line diversification and balance sheet strength, giving us the opportunity to further differentiate CBRE. Given our sizable financial capacity, we expect shareholder capital returns will continue to figure prominently within our capital allocation plans over this multiyear horizon. Ending with Slide 15. Since 2016, core adjusted EPS has achieved average annual growth of 21%, while revenue and free cash flow have also grown at double-digit annual rates over this period. This strong growth has been supported by the strategic steps we've taken to bolster our balance sheet while pursuing a disciplined capital allocation program and increasingly diversifying our business. We expect our multiyear growth framework will extend the successful track record of performance across our key financial metrics. We are extremely optimistic about our trajectory as we head into 2022 and look forward to delivering another year of strong performance. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a first question from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. I guess my first question is just to understand if, I guess, the new EPS metric is going to be core adjusted, what's the EBITDA that ties to that metric? Because it doesn't seem like it's the $1.124 billion.\nKristyn Farahmand: So we haven't changed the adjusted EBITDA metric, but there are going to be 2 different segment operating profit metrics going forward for each segment. So we will be reporting consolidated segment operating profit for each segment as well as operating profit attributable to CBRE common stockholders. And for purpose of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, we feel like that's the best measure for the company in terms of the EBITDA metric because we are fully consolidating all of Turner & Townsend's financials into our own. And so that keeps the margins actually logical.\nEmma Giamartino: And Anthony, I'll just add on core adjusted EPS, the comparable -- we're not reporting a comparable core adjusted EBITDA. So our adjusted EBITDA will include the gains from the SPAC and our venture capital gains. Does that answer your question?\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, I think so.\nOperator: We have next question from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlexander Kramm: Yes. You made those comments on inflation, and I didn't look at the slides that you had from your research group. But I think, on balance, you think inflation is positive. Does that include rate hikes as they're obviously forecasted now to happen? Maybe you can specifically talk about rates. You have a very diversified business, so kind of hard to think through where rate increases may hit you. So maybe a little bit more detail on that would be helpful.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. So we've based our outlook based on what our in-house economist believe will happen in terms of inflation and rate hikes over the next year. And his view is that inflation will moderate through 2022 and 2023, and the federal -- and we'll do a similar number of hikes as the market is projecting to manage that inflation. And so we've incorporated that outlook into our guidance. As we said, we think we have -- we know that we have a number of inflation hedges throughout our business, but there are areas where we know inflation will impact us. And so there are 2 main areas where we've incorporated that. For the half of our global employee base that is not reimbursed by clients, we have factored in wage inflation. And then for our relevant business lines that may be impacted by cap rates, we've assumed some moderation in cap rates throughout the year. And that may be a conservative assumption going forward. And then I do want to say that our outlook does not contemplate the uncertainty and impacts from the geopolitical tensions that are rising throughout the world.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. And then maybe shifting to margin quickly. Can you just flesh out the margin comments a little bit more? I guess, on the advisory side, what's the right base to use for that margin comment given that you present your margins sometimes with or without gains? And then on the GWS side, again, it sounds like that's tied to, I think you mentioned a 1% impact from certain items. But like if you think about the core underlying GWS business organically, is that seeing benefits from operating leverage? Or are there also other investments that are countering that in 2022?\nEmma Giamartino: So throughout our businesses throughout all 3 lines of business, we are investing more to drive incremental growth in future periods. So across all 3 business lines, we're investing about $300 million in OpEx, and those investments are for areas like increasing our capabilities and to serve our clients in GWS, for example, expanding into smart buildings; in advisory, where we are increasing our consulting group to drive future growth. And in REI, we're launching new products in life sciences and infrastructure, which is requiring some investment in 2022. And then you mentioned the 1%. Our margin expectations for this year also include strategic equity grants that we are putting in place to help align a broader set of our leadership team across advisory and GWS, and that's about a $22 million SOP impact across those 2 segments.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. And sorry, on the advisory side, what's the right base to use for the margin -- flat margin comment? Sorry, just I don't know if you answered that.\nEmma Giamartino: Excluding OMSRs.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have next question from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.\nJade Rahmani: I think on a recent markets call hosted by CBRE, your team mentioned that the company intermediated around $400 billion of transactions in 2021, of which around $80 billion was debt placement. So I wanted to ask in the debt brokerage space how big a priority is growing that business. Do you see that as meaningful? And I would have expected the mix between debt and equity to be closer to equal, so that $80 billion baseline seems like there's a big potential to grow.\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Jade, this is Bob. We have significant efforts underway to grow all of our lines of business in all 3 segments of the company. And the debt business has grown nicely over the last several years. We expect it to continue to grow. Obviously, the sales numbers that you heard for 2021 and specifically the fourth quarter of the year were the subject of us taking market share in a market that was very strong, and that's what you're seeing in those big numbers.\nJade Rahmani: In a normal market environment, leaving aside current geopolitical uncertainty, do you anticipate that the debt business would be closer to perhaps 30% to 40% of the total?\nRobert Sulentic: I don't think we've put those numbers out there.\nJade Rahmani: As it relates to uncertainty prior to Ukraine, there was growing uncertainty with respect to the interest rate outlook and inflation. Are you seeing or noticing any changes in sentiment or tone from customers? You mentioned the very strong first quarter results so far in leasing. But just want to hear what you're hearing from clients that they're getting more cautious if there's any changes in the appetite to transact.\nRobert Sulentic: Well, the fact of the matter is, Jade, some of the biggest news related to Russia and Ukraine has unfolded over the last 24 hours, and everybody is watching that and concerned about that. And everybody is concerned about what the impact might be on the global economy. And when I say everybody, everybody in our sector, but everybody pretty much in every sector. The thing that shouldn't be lost in all of this, though, and we talked a lot about it here today, and we've talked about it the last few quarters, we have built a business that is really well diversified across those 4 dimensions: asset type, client type, service type and geography. And there is a massive amount of commercial real estate around the world that is going to be used in various places depending on what's going on and in various types of assets and services. And because we have a broad footprint across all those dimensions, we're able to push our resources, our management time, our M&A focus, our capital into the areas that we think are most benefited secularly at any given point in time. That's come across in our results the last couple of years. It clearly came across in our results for 2021. So irregardless of what happens geopolitically, irregardless of what happens in the economy, we are much better positioned than we have been historically and relatively well positioned to other companies in our sector and other companies across business. And you saw what played out for CBRE relative to the S&P 500 in the wake of COVID-19. So I think there's real risk out there geopolitically, but I think we're well positioned to withstand whatever the economy brings in our direction.\nJade Rahmani: When you think about infrastructure as an opportunity for the company, is there any further dimension that you could put around that? Do you see it as, for example, core within real estate but expanding the services that are offering or really moving beyond core real estate to areas such as perhaps chemicals, manufacturing, aviation, energy, government? Are you talking about really expanding CBRE's offering into those core infrastructure sectors?\nRobert Sulentic: Well, infrastructure is relevant to us today in 2 big areas. Number one, Turner & Townsend. Turner & Townsend does a lot of infrastructure work in a variety of industries and for governments around the world, and so we expect that to grow over time. We expect that to grow with Turner & Townsend, who's growing very, very nicely in that area. The second place is we have a relatively small but growing infrastructure Investment Management business. As that business grows, either organically or through acquisitions, we expect that it'll touch those other client sources or those other investment opportunities beyond commercial real estate. In fact, it is a separate asset from commercial real estate. It's a real asset class, but it's a separate asset class. And the projected growth for it over the next decade is enormous, as you know.\nJade Rahmani: So you envision CBRE eventually having infrastructure away from core commercial real estate as a key product offering or a business line item?\nRobert Sulentic: We have that today with Turner & Townsend and Investment Management, and we expect it to grow significantly. So yes.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. And lastly, within Turner & Townsend, what percentage of their business relates to climate to build the resiliency, energy-related situations?\nEmma Giamartino: Energy-related work is about 10% of the revenue historically.\nRobert Sulentic: And growing. The other thing about that, Jade, and we get that question with regard to our own business. And the answer is not as clean as we would all maybe like it to be when we're answering the question, right? So we have products or services that are directly attentive to green energy, consulting work we do, project work we do. But our green energy work, our environmental work is embedded across our business. It's in our development business, in the nature of the buildings we design and develop. It's in our property management business. It's in our project management business. It's in our Facilities Management business. It's hugely embedded in our -- this massive supply chain we have. So when you look at a company like Turner & Townsend or you look at the work we do, there's direct specific sustainability work, but then it's -- we create advantages for our clients and growth momentum for ourselves due to sustainability-related work we do across all those services.\nOperator: We have next question from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Sakwa: Yes. I guess, Emma, I'm just trying to sort of piece together a bunch of the numbers that you've put out there and what you guys had in the slide deck. You sort of talked about this low double-digit sort of earnings growth from '21 to '25. I realize it's not going to be exactly linear by year. If you just sort of took that at face value, that would sort of suggest you'd be up in the kind of high $5 range, maybe pushing $6 a share. I realize you didn't give the exact EPS guidance, but then you also talked about this $300 million additional investment that you're making, and I realize that's within the margin. So I'm just trying to make sure that when you talk about these additional investments, is that sort of inclusive of that sort of low double-digit growth and so, effectively, you'd be doing a lot more earnings power if you weren't making these investments? Or is that kind of a drag in the short term on that 11 to 12 and you hockey stick a little bit more in, say, '23, '24, '25?\nEmma Giamartino: No, it's the former. It's -- that $300 million of investments is embedded in our outlook for this year. And without that investment, our EPS growth would be significantly higher, but we believe those investments are important to drive future growth.\nStephen Sakwa: Great. And just as a follow-up, as you look at that, do you look at that as sort of a onetime? Or do you think those investments are sort of ongoing, maybe not at those levels? Or I guess, should we start to see margin improve more. And I can understand you got to make the investments today, but should we see better margin improvement, say, in '23 and beyond?\nEmma Giamartino: So those are ongoing investments that we continue to execute in our business as we're trying to drive incremental growth in the future with new capabilities across our lines of business. I threw out a couple of examples earlier. And one thing to note is that in 2021, we invested in our business, and we set out to invest to drive growth at the beginning of the year based on the revenue that we anticipated hitting throughout 2021. If we had known revenue would have accelerated the way it did in the latter half of 2021, we would have invested more in OpEx in 2021 than we did. And so you're seeing some of the margin expansion in 2021 as a result of that. So we weren't able to get our investments up to where we would have if we could have anticipated the growth.\nStephen Sakwa: Okay. And then just last question. I know you were pretty programmatic on the buyback. It sounds like that will sort of stay in place, maybe accelerate a little bit if the stock sells off with the equity market pullback. But is that -- roughly $400 million, is that sort of embedded in effectively the guidance? Or would the buyback benefits all be additive to that kind of low double-digit earnings growth rate? Just trying to figure out how much of the buyback is sort of already in your expectations and how much would be additive.\nEmma Giamartino: We have a modest level of repurchases embedded in our outlook, but not the entirety of it. And the way we look at our programmatic repurchase program is we use it as a balance to optimize our return to shareholders. So if we see a really strong M&A pipeline, which we do, I mean we execute some of those larger deals, we'll pull back on our repurchases throughout the year. So we're really using it as a lever. So in that outlook, you're seeing a small level of repurchases. You're also seeing a very low level of M&A. And so any of those uses of capital will be incremental to our growth.\nStephen Sakwa: Great. And then last question, just maybe on that M&A pipeline. I realize you won't name names, but could you maybe just talk about the types of businesses that you're seeing the most activity and where you're most interested?\nRobert Sulentic: Steve, we really look across all 3 of our segments for opportunities to expand our offering to our clients and grow the business. And of course, strategically, we have particular areas that we're more focused on than others. We don't talk about those publicly until we do a deal because we consider proprietary information. But I will tell you that we have a very rigorous program that is run between our -- the leadership of our 3 segments and Emma's corporate development team, where we identify specific areas in each of the 3 segments of the business that we think are particularly well suited to grow through M&A. And some of that M&A is infill M&A, and some of that M&A is more transformational. We also -- we have our eye on a number of what we call sponsorship opportunities that would be consistent with what we did with Turner & Townsend or Industrious, where we think we can buy a portion of a company, have them help us in the way we serve our clients and help them supercharge their growth in the way we bring them into our orbit, so to speak, to serve the clients we have. So all of those things are part of our M&A strategy. It's broad. It comes to small deals and large deals, and you should expect to see significant use of capital going forward to further grow the business through M&A.\nOperator: We have next question from the line of Matthew Filek with William Blair.\nMatthew Filek: This is Matt Filek on for Stephen Sheldon. I was wondering if you can provide some additional commentary on leasing. Specifically, how much of the strong leasing guidance is driven by a recovery in office versus continued strength in areas like industrial? And have you seen any changes in lease duration?\nEmma Giamartino: So throughout this year, we're seeing -- I think as I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting recovery across all asset types. Industrial specifically, we're expecting that to slow somewhat as supply has become somewhat constrained. We're expecting office to return similar to how it did throughout the latter half of 2021. And then what was the second part of your question?\nMatthew Filek: Yes, just wondering about changes in lease durations, if those are longer.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. Lease terms have picked up slightly and continuously throughout 2021. I think new lease terms are up 1%, and renewals are up 4%, but they haven't materially moved. So new lease terms are about 6 years, and renewal terms are at about 4 years.\nMatthew Filek: Great. That's helpful. And then one additional follow-up. Can you also talk about the performance between small and large leasing deals? I think you had previously mentioned that large leasing deals were still below pre-pandemic levels in the prior quarter. I'm just wondering if there's been any changes there.\nRobert Sulentic: Matt, large leasing deals have picked up on the office side, but they haven't -- we're not back to where we were pre-pandemic. Of course, large leasing deals in industrial have been unlike anything we've seen historically. And in the absence system, supply constraint, we would expect large leases on the industrial side to continue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have next question from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlexander Kramm: Yes. Just could I squeeze in a couple of follow-ups? It should be quick. Just on your medium-term outlook, I think you previously had caveated that with -- does not include a return to office, and maybe that's a couple of quarters ago. But is office embedded in that now? Or what is embedded in terms of office in your updated guidance? So yes, any color would be helpful.\nRobert Sulentic: Alex, we've embedded assumptions about return to the office in our guidance, and they're slightly more conservative than they were in the prior couple of quarters. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and we see it all over the place with companies trying to figure out and employees trying to figure out the degree to which they'll go back to the office. So we think that the return to the office is going to be slightly less than we would have thought 90 days ago or 180 days ago, and that's embedded in our numbers. We also think, though, that there's other things that are going on as a result of the way people are looking at their office space usage that are going to help our business, significant opportunity in project management. We continue to be there -- I believe there's going to be significant opportunity in the flex space arena where we've invested in Industrious. And our big clients all over the world are telling us that. And all of those assumptions are embedded in what we've modeled for our business.\nAlexander Kramm: Fair enough. And then just last one from me. You mentioned the changes to the splits, I believe. I didn't fully catch the comment was impacting, I think, the margin last year. Can you just remind me what exactly you've done there? And then also what the reception has been from, I guess, various parts of your brokerage force?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. This is an important clarification. It was not a change to split. It's that as producers do more volume, they enter into a higher tranche of splits. And so as they did more volume in Q4, they entered more, producers, than usual, entered into the higher tranche of splits. So no change to what those tranches are, what the splits are.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the call back to Bob Sulentic, CEO, for closing remarks. Over to you, sir.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll speak with you again at the end of the first quarter when we give the results for that period.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. 2021 was an outstanding year for CBRE with strong growth across our key financial metrics and record free cash flow driven by operational discipline and our 4-dimension diversification strategy. We're also well positioned for future growth, which I'll discuss shortly. Throughout my remarks today, I'll highlight how our results benefited from asset type diversification, and in future quarters, I will focus on the benefits of other diversification dimension. Now please turn to Slide 9, so we can dive into our results for the quarter. Like Q3, I'll include compares with Q4 2019 for their transactional business lines to provide insight into our performance from peak levels. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 24% compared to Q4 2020 and 20% over Q4 2019 led by rebounding sales and lease revenue. Advisory Services added nearly $1 billion in net revenue, growing 43% for Q4 2020 and 23% over Q4 2019 to over $3.3 billion, a record for our largest segment. We continued to benefit from a supportive property sales backdrop. Globally, sales revenue jumped over 73% from Q4 2020 and 45% from Q4 2019. The U.S. led the recovery among our major markets with 89% sales revenue growth compared to the prior year quarter. We had the highest market share across all major asset types in 2021, while our overall U.S. market share rose 100 basis points in the quarter according to independent data provider, Real Capital Analytics. Capital inflows into multifamily and industrial remained strong, allowing us to benefit from the very intentional work we have done to build leading sales platforms focused on these asset types. U.S. industrial sales revenue more than doubled from Q4 2019, while U.S. multifamily sales nearly doubled over the same period. Office continues to gradually improve back towards pre-pandemic levels. And our U.S. office sales revenue was around 14% shy of Q4 2019, an improvement from steeper declines in the prior quarters. Global leasing revenue rose 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 with all 3 regions ahead of 2019 levels for the second consecutive quarter. EMEA leasing revenue grew 25% on Q4 2019, and the Americas was up 13%, while APAC grew 7%. Industrial leasing surged around 60% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 as occupier demand for distribution space remains strong. Like in sales, office leasing also continued to recover with global office leasing nearly flat versus Q4 2019. EMEA and APAC office leasing rose around 7% and 11%, respectively, compared to Q4 2019. U.S. office leasing revenue trends also continued to improve. While still below its 2019 level by around 4%, the year-over-year shortfall from prior peak levels has narrowed compared to previous quarters. Notably, while it's still early in the year, we are continuing to see strong momentum in both U.S. sales and leasing thus far in 2022, with revenue trending significantly above prior peak first quarter levels. Loan servicing was the primary growth driver within the rest of advisory, with revenue rising around 70% from Q4 2019 to nearly $93 million. Our loan servicing portfolio grew 23% versus the prior year and 10% sequentially to nearly $330 billion, primarily driven by private capital sources. Our multifamily portfolio, comprising nearly half of the total, grew about 14% versus Q4 2020. Our alternative asset type portfolio, which includes agriculture, health care, hotels and others, rose over 70% and now comprises approximately 19% of our total servicing portfolio. Growth was driven by a strong pace of third-party servicing wins, which is a key focus area for growth in this business. OMSR gains faced a tough compare and were down about $47 million. These gains were elevated in last year's fourth quarter as the government agencies were extremely active in providing liquidity to a multifamily market burdened by COVID impact. Turning to GWS. Net revenue grew 22%, increasing $330 million to nearly $1.9 billion. This includes about $175 million in net revenue from the Turner & Townsend transaction, which closed on November 1 and was in line with our previous expectations. We are extremely excited about the growth trajectory for this business. Project management is a fragmented market, estimated to be over $100 billion with strong secular growth tailwinds, particularly within infrastructure. This transaction helps to bolster the nascent infrastructure capabilities within our existing businesses. We believe broadening our infrastructure offerings will help to accelerate future growth and deepen diversification, especially by helping to further insulate our business for more cyclical trends. Our legacy GWS revenue grew nearly 8% led by project management, which rose about 17%, excluding contributions from Turner & Townsend. Strong growth in project management was driven by continued recovery from the pandemic-constrained environment. Facilities Management revenue increased nearly 6%, and net revenue rose over 10% supported by growth from local clients. We expect Facilities Management growth to benefit from continued progress in returning to a more normal business environment in 2022. Looking at REI, revenue increased $125 million or 43% to over $413 million. This was driven by increasing activity in our U.K. multifamily development business, which is continuing to recover from COVID-related challenges. Investment Management revenue was relatively flat versus Q4 2020 at about $150 million due to lower carried interest revenue, which can be volatile. Excluding carried interest revenue, Investment Management revenue grew 19%, driven by strong asset management fee growth. AUM rose to a new record of nearly $142 billion with more than 80% invested in assets other than office. Industrial comprises the largest component, in line with our strategic vision to position the company to benefit from this sector's strong secular tailwinds. Flipping to Slide 10. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA grew to over $1.1 billion. Excluding noncash gains related to OMSRs, our Altus Power investment through our SPAC and venture capital investments, adjusted EBITDA grew over 37% compared to Q4 2020. On this basis, our underlying adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue rose 6 basis points versus Q4 2020 to 16.5%, which is 1.7% above our Q4 2019 level. Advisory Services segment operating profit marginally exceeded our expectations, increasing $219 million to over $740 million as sales and lease revenue rose more than expected. Advisory's net operating profit margin, excluding volatile noncash OMSR gains, reached a new record of 21.5%, about 120 basis points better than Q4 2019. We achieved this despite record productivity pushing more producers into higher split tranches. In GWS, legacy segment operating profit reflected higher-than-expected medical expenses as we saw a ramp-up in year-end insurance claims compared with 2020's severely pandemic-constrained levels as well as a $3 million impact of noncash deferred purchase consideration expense for Turner & Townsend. Turner & Townsend profitability performed in line with our expectations, contributing just over $23 million of profit from November 1 through year-end. REI segment operating profit rose $39 million to $156 million and was roughly in line with expectations as outperformance in Investment Management offset a modest shortfall in development. Investment Management benefited from higher-than-expected net promotes and co-investment returns driving operating profit to $41 million. Development operating profit of $122 million was affected by a $29 million increase in the reserve we had previously taken on a U.K. construction project that faced challenges that were exacerbated by the pandemic. We believe we have fully reserved for this project and don't expect it to result in further adverse financial impacts. Putting aside this reserve increase, development operating profit would have been over $150 million for the quarter and about $380 million for the year, surpassing our previous expectations. This was driven by the conversion of our average in-process portfolio to operating profit at a rate of over 2.1% over the trailing 12-month period, a level well above our historical norm of between 1% and 2% with most years around the midpoint. We also saw increased corporate overhead in the quarter. This is largely driven by higher incentive compensation as performance materially exceeded initial 2021 expectations and our investments in key corporate functions to help support our larger business. We do not expect incentive compensation to fluctuate as much in 2022 as business volatility continues to normalize. Looking at Slide 11, adjusted earnings per share rose 51% to $2.19. This includes a benefit of $0.36 from a gain in our SPAC investment and another $0.03 from mark-to-market adjustments on our Altus Power and VC investments. Excluding these noncash gains, core adjusted EPS rose 24% to $1.80. Excluding only the SPAC deconsolidation gain, which is consistent with how we've reported our results in previous quarters, adjusted EPS rose over 26% to $1.83. Robust underlying earnings growth reflects the strong increase in adjusted EBITDA as well as lower net interest expense. These were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization, mainly related to elevated prepayments of government agency-related loans, which triggered higher OMSR amortization. Our results also include noncash interest expense related to deferred purchase consideration for our remaining Turner & Townsend payments and an increase in our effective adjusted tax rate to 23.9%. The nonrecurring reserve increase in the U.K. multifamily development business lowered earnings by approximately $0.07. Going forward, as Kristyn noted earlier, we'll report both adjusted EPS and core adjusted EPS to give you transparency into how both our core operations and noncore investments are performing. Now we'll discuss our financial capacity on Slide 12. Due to our strong profitability, we generated nearly $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our annual free cash flow total to almost $2.2 billion, which is a new record for our company. We ended the year with a net cash position of 0.2 turn while deploying nearly $1.8 billion of capital, net of debt issuance proceeds during the year, primarily for investments in future growth. We also repurchased around $370 million of stock, providing our shareholders a repurchase yield of over 1%. We intend to continue this capital deployment strategy and believe there is ample opportunity to invest in future growth while also programmatically returning cash to our shareholders. In support of this, we commenced our fifth consecutive quarter of repurchases in Q1 2022. We intend to continue repurchases throughout this year, assuming the return remains attractive and we have capacity given our evolving M&A pipeline. Additionally, as we move forward, strong free cash flow conversion will remain a priority for us, and our senior executive team will be evaluated on this metric as part of their 2022 goals. Please turn to Slide 13. We expect another year of strong growth in 2022. Market conditions remain generally favorable, notwithstanding heightened geopolitical tensions, and tailwinds are likely to persist across the 4 dimensions of our business and areas where we are proactively investing to drive growth. Advisory Services is positioned for another year of strong revenue and segment operating profit growth, with leasing revenue expected to rise at a high teen to low 20% rate and sales revenue expected to rise at a low to mid-teens rate. We expect incremental benefit from offices gradual recovery and that industrial leasing should decelerate modestly due to a potential near-term shortage of available properties. As Bob highlighted earlier, we believe long-term secular trends are bolstering demand for industrial space and expect strong performance for this asset class on a long-run basis. Outside of sales and leasing, we expect advisory revenue to rise at a high single-digit to low double-digit clip compared to 2021. We also expect advisory's operating margin to be roughly flat versus the prior year as the benefit of high-margin transactional revenue growth will be tempered by some operating expense investments designed to accelerate future growth. Advisory operating profit expectations also include increased strategic equity awards to help better align a broader leadership team with our enterprise strategy and shareholders. We expect strong long-run margin performance in advisory, partially driven by these investments. In GWS, we expect low to mid-double-digit organic top line growth and mid- to high single-digit organic segment operating profit growth. This is being driven by continued strong growth in project management and accelerated growth in enterprise facilities management, partially driven by a return to normal contract cycle times. We expect this growth to be more weighted to the second half of the year. GWS legacy segment operating profit expectations also include the impact of $17 million of noncash deferred purchase consideration expense for Turner & Townsend. This expense will continue through 2025 when we've made the last of our required payments. We will also record about $10 million in noncash interest expense associated with our deferred payments. Like in advisory, GWS operating profit expectations also include an impact from increased use of strategic equity awards. This is reducing expected legacy segment operating profit growth by around 1%. We expect Turner & Townsend to grow net revenue at a mid-teens rate, in line with its historical average over the approximately $974 million it generated in calendar year 2021. Strong organic growth is expected to more than offset a small foreign exchange headwind at today's spot rate. Turner & Townsend net operating profit margin is projected to tick up around 0.5% from the 13.4% generated in the fourth quarter. This reflects strong top line growth, the restoration of certain expenses cut during COVID and about $10 million of noncash expense for retention bonuses. REI revenue is expected to grow around 20%, and segment operating profit is expected to roughly match the elevated operating profit of $520 million generated in 2021, excluding the $24 million accounting change-driven gain that we recorded in last year's first quarter. Revenue growth is being driven by continued recovery of our U.K. development business. Our REI expectations also contemplate elevated hiring and investment management for new product development, a key strategic focus as well as more moderate appreciation and asset values. Finally, we expect our development in-process portfolio will convert to operating profit at a rate of under 2%, in line with historical performance. Our in-process portfolio is well positioned for the current environment with nearly 80% of the portfolio comprised of industrial, multifamily, health care and life sciences assets. As you can see, we are consciously orienting the portfolio towards assets with strong long-term performance potential. Setting aside any effects of our strategic noncore investments, we expect corporate overhead to decline nearly 5% from 2021. We anticipate investments in further scaling key corporate functions to be more than offset by more favorable incentive compensation impact. Going forward, core adjusted earnings, which excludes the impact of our small portfolio of strategic noncore investments, will be the basis of our financial forecast. We are making these investments for their strategic value rather than near-term financial gains. However, there will likely be sharp volatility in their investment valuation, especially for our largest noncore investment in publicly traded Altus Power. Altus is poised to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy while enhancing capabilities to help our clients meet their clean energy and sustainability goals. As always, for investments of this nature, short-term bouts of market volatility can cause the value of our investment to swing sharply on a quarter-to-quarter basis. For example, the majority of the noncash gain we recognized in the fourth quarter would be reversed in the first quarter at Altus' share price as of February 15. Now looking at depreciation and amortization. We expect this to rise about 4%, and we project our effective adjusted tax rate to be in line with the 23.9% rate we saw in Q4 2021. We are also highly focused on monitoring how inflation could impact our business. Real estate provides a natural inflation hedge when held on a long-term basis, which somewhat cushions our transactional businesses. In fact, sales could potentially even benefit if inflation concerns draw more capital to real estate. On the expense side, clients reimburse us for the salary and benefits of nearly half of our employee base who work primarily in the GWS and property management businesses, and inflation provisions are typically embedded in our multiyear GWS contracts. In light of this, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in a higher inflation environment. It is also prudent to highlight that while the current operating environment remains favorable, there is heightened uncertainty given this higher inflationary environment, tighter monetary policy and rising geopolitical tensions. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update of our multiyear growth framework. As Bob noted, we've raised our base case annual core adjusted EPS growth expectations to more than 20% for the 2020 to 2025 period and to low double digits for the next 4 years. There is upside to both growth rates from additional capital deployment. We envision solid organic revenue and earnings growth across our 3 business segments. Our overall margin is expected to gradually increase over this period even with considerable growth from our lower-margin GWS segment. The GWS margin itself should also improve over time as higher-margin project management accounts for a larger share of our GWS revenue base. We will continue to manage our balance sheet prudently. We are comfortable with increasing net leverage to around 1 turn as we deploy capital into M&A to accelerate growth. We can even go as high as 2 turns for a highly compelling strategic opportunity. We expect to focus our capital deployment strategy on secularly favorite areas that will further diversify our business. We see significant opportunity to expand our investor, operator, developer model into multifamily, life sciences and infrastructure. Importantly, this model plays to our competitive advantages, including cross-functional collaboration, business line diversification and balance sheet strength, giving us the opportunity to further differentiate CBRE. Given our sizable financial capacity, we expect shareholder capital returns will continue to figure prominently within our capital allocation plans over this multiyear horizon. Ending with Slide 15. Since 2016, core adjusted EPS has achieved average annual growth of 21%, while revenue and free cash flow have also grown at double-digit annual rates over this period. This strong growth has been supported by the strategic steps we've taken to bolster our balance sheet while pursuing a disciplined capital allocation program and increasingly diversifying our business. We expect our multiyear growth framework will extend the successful track record of performance across our key financial metrics. We are extremely optimistic about our trajectory as we head into 2022 and look forward to delivering another year of strong performance. And with that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. And Anthony, I'll just add on core adjusted EPS, the comparable -- we're not reporting a comparable core adjusted EBITDA. So our adjusted EBITDA will include the gains from the SPAC and our venture capital gains. Does that answer your question? Yes. So we've based our outlook based on what our in-house economist believe will happen in terms of inflation and rate hikes over the next year. And his view is that inflation will moderate through 2022 and 2023, and the federal -- and we'll do a similar number of hikes as the market is projecting to manage that inflation. And so we've incorporated that outlook into our guidance. As we said, we think we have -- we know that we have a number of inflation hedges throughout our business, but there are areas where we know inflation will impact us. And so there are 2 main areas where we've incorporated that. For the half of our global employee base that is not reimbursed by clients, we have factored in wage inflation. And then for our relevant business lines that may be impacted by cap rates, we've assumed some moderation in cap rates throughout the year. And that may be a conservative assumption going forward. And then I do want to say that our outlook does not contemplate the uncertainty and impacts from the geopolitical tensions that are rising throughout the world. So throughout our businesses throughout all 3 lines of business, we are investing more to drive incremental growth in future periods. So across all 3 business lines, we're investing about $300 million in OpEx, and those investments are for areas like increasing our capabilities and to serve our clients in GWS, for example, expanding into smart buildings; in advisory, where we are increasing our consulting group to drive future growth. And in REI, we're launching new products in life sciences and infrastructure, which is requiring some investment in 2022. And then you mentioned the 1%. Our margin expectations for this year also include strategic equity grants that we are putting in place to help align a broader set of our leadership team across advisory and GWS, and that's about a $22 million SOP impact across those 2 segments. Excluding OMSRs. Energy-related work is about 10% of the revenue historically. No, it's the former. It's -- that $300 million of investments is embedded in our outlook for this year. And without that investment, our EPS growth would be significantly higher, but we believe those investments are important to drive future growth. So those are ongoing investments that we continue to execute in our business as we're trying to drive incremental growth in the future with new capabilities across our lines of business. I threw out a couple of examples earlier. And one thing to note is that in 2021, we invested in our business, and we set out to invest to drive growth at the beginning of the year based on the revenue that we anticipated hitting throughout 2021. If we had known revenue would have accelerated the way it did in the latter half of 2021, we would have invested more in OpEx in 2021 than we did. And so you're seeing some of the margin expansion in 2021 as a result of that. So we weren't able to get our investments up to where we would have if we could have anticipated the growth. We have a modest level of repurchases embedded in our outlook, but not the entirety of it. And the way we look at our programmatic repurchase program is we use it as a balance to optimize our return to shareholders. So if we see a really strong M&A pipeline, which we do, I mean we execute some of those larger deals, we'll pull back on our repurchases throughout the year. So we're really using it as a lever. So in that outlook, you're seeing a small level of repurchases. You're also seeing a very low level of M&A. And so any of those uses of capital will be incremental to our growth. So throughout this year, we're seeing -- I think as I mentioned in my remarks, we're expecting recovery across all asset types. Industrial specifically, we're expecting that to slow somewhat as supply has become somewhat constrained. We're expecting office to return similar to how it did throughout the latter half of 2021. And then what was the second part of your question? Yes. Lease terms have picked up slightly and continuously throughout 2021. I think new lease terms are up 1%, and renewals are up 4%, but they haven't materially moved. So new lease terms are about 6 years, and renewal terms are at about 4 years. Yes. This is an important clarification. It was not a change to split. It's that as producers do more volume, they enter into a higher tranche of splits. And so as they did more volume in Q4, they entered more, producers, than usual, entered into the higher tranche of splits. So no change to what those tranches are, what the splits are."

            "name": "Robert Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we had a strong finish to 2021 significantly outperforming both Q4 2020 and the pre-pandemic peak in Q4 2019. This capped an outstanding year for CBRE with all key financial benchmarks reaching new all-time highs for the company. We certainly benefited from a supportive macro environment in 2021. Beyond that, our strong financial performance is the product of our long-standing work to strengthen our balance sheet and improve the resiliency of our income statement as well as our successful efforts over the past several years to diversify our business across 4 dimensions: asset types, lines of business, clients and geographies. We have described our diversification efforts in detail in recent quarters, highlighting how it has positioned CBRE to benefit significantly from secular tailwinds. Prime examples of this are our investments in Turner & Townsend, a project manager that enhances our green energy and infrastructure capabilities; and Industrious, a leading asset-light player in the growing flex space market. In our Real Estate Investments segment, we are now executing a strategy to realize positive synergies between our development and Investment Management businesses with support from our strong balance sheet. So far, this effort has focused on industrial and logistics assets which are benefiting from long-term secular trends. Our research team projects that global e-commerce sales will rise to approximately $3.9 trillion by 2025, requiring an additional 1.5 billion square feet of distribution space. Specifically, we are placing development projects into investment programs run by CBRE Investment Management, essentially converting portions of our more than $18 billion in-process development portfolio into Investment Management AUM. This strategy also capitalizes on our industrial investment sales and property management expertise. At the same time, we are further building AUM in our industrial and logistics strategy by supporting CBRE Investment Management's acquisition of large portfolios of operating assets. The most recent example is the agreement to acquire a $4.9 billion portfolio of U.S. and European logistics assets from Hillwood. Our balance sheet provided a backstop proportions of this portfolio, which enabled our team to move quickly to secure a highly desirable set of assets. We plan to replicate this model for other secularly favored asset types, including multifamily and life sciences and expect our integrated investor, operator, developer model will generate material incremental recurring revenues and earnings for years to come. Reflecting our strong 2021 performance and the substantial opportunities we see in front of us, we are increasing our multiyear aspirational growth framework. For the period from 2020 to 2025, we now expect our average annual core adjusted EPS growth to exceed 20% barring an economic disruption from geopolitical or other events, which we are watching closely. This is up from the low double-digit growth expectation we set a year ago. The average annual growth rate is expected to be in the low double digits for the prospective period from 2021 to 2025. We believe there is potential upside to our expected growth rates for both periods through incremental capital deployment. Emma will walk you through this in detail after she reviews the quarter. Emma? Yes, Jade, this is Bob. We have significant efforts underway to grow all of our lines of business in all 3 segments of the company. And the debt business has grown nicely over the last several years. We expect it to continue to grow. Obviously, the sales numbers that you heard for 2021 and specifically the fourth quarter of the year were the subject of us taking market share in a market that was very strong, and that's what you're seeing in those big numbers. I don't think we've put those numbers out there. Well, the fact of the matter is, Jade, some of the biggest news related to Russia and Ukraine has unfolded over the last 24 hours, and everybody is watching that and concerned about that. And everybody is concerned about what the impact might be on the global economy. And when I say everybody, everybody in our sector, but everybody pretty much in every sector. The thing that shouldn't be lost in all of this, though, and we talked a lot about it here today, and we've talked about it the last few quarters, we have built a business that is really well diversified across those 4 dimensions: asset type, client type, service type and geography. And there is a massive amount of commercial real estate around the world that is going to be used in various places depending on what's going on and in various types of assets and services. And because we have a broad footprint across all those dimensions, we're able to push our resources, our management time, our M&A focus, our capital into the areas that we think are most benefited secularly at any given point in time. That's come across in our results the last couple of years. It clearly came across in our results for 2021. So irregardless of what happens geopolitically, irregardless of what happens in the economy, we are much better positioned than we have been historically and relatively well positioned to other companies in our sector and other companies across business. And you saw what played out for CBRE relative to the S&P 500 in the wake of COVID-19. So I think there's real risk out there geopolitically, but I think we're well positioned to withstand whatever the economy brings in our direction. Well, infrastructure is relevant to us today in 2 big areas. Number one, Turner & Townsend. Turner & Townsend does a lot of infrastructure work in a variety of industries and for governments around the world, and so we expect that to grow over time. We expect that to grow with Turner & Townsend, who's growing very, very nicely in that area. The second place is we have a relatively small but growing infrastructure Investment Management business. As that business grows, either organically or through acquisitions, we expect that it'll touch those other client sources or those other investment opportunities beyond commercial real estate. In fact, it is a separate asset from commercial real estate. It's a real asset class, but it's a separate asset class. And the projected growth for it over the next decade is enormous, as you know. We have that today with Turner & Townsend and Investment Management, and we expect it to grow significantly. So yes. And growing. The other thing about that, Jade, and we get that question with regard to our own business. And the answer is not as clean as we would all maybe like it to be when we're answering the question, right? So we have products or services that are directly attentive to green energy, consulting work we do, project work we do. But our green energy work, our environmental work is embedded across our business. It's in our development business, in the nature of the buildings we design and develop. It's in our property management business. It's in our project management business. It's in our Facilities Management business. It's hugely embedded in our -- this massive supply chain we have. So when you look at a company like Turner & Townsend or you look at the work we do, there's direct specific sustainability work, but then it's -- we create advantages for our clients and growth momentum for ourselves due to sustainability-related work we do across all those services. Steve, we really look across all 3 of our segments for opportunities to expand our offering to our clients and grow the business. And of course, strategically, we have particular areas that we're more focused on than others. We don't talk about those publicly until we do a deal because we consider proprietary information. But I will tell you that we have a very rigorous program that is run between our -- the leadership of our 3 segments and Emma's corporate development team, where we identify specific areas in each of the 3 segments of the business that we think are particularly well suited to grow through M&A. And some of that M&A is infill M&A, and some of that M&A is more transformational. We also -- we have our eye on a number of what we call sponsorship opportunities that would be consistent with what we did with Turner & Townsend or Industrious, where we think we can buy a portion of a company, have them help us in the way we serve our clients and help them supercharge their growth in the way we bring them into our orbit, so to speak, to serve the clients we have. So all of those things are part of our M&A strategy. It's broad. It comes to small deals and large deals, and you should expect to see significant use of capital going forward to further grow the business through M&A. Matt, large leasing deals have picked up on the office side, but they haven't -- we're not back to where we were pre-pandemic. Of course, large leasing deals in industrial have been unlike anything we've seen historically. And in the absence system, supply constraint, we would expect large leases on the industrial side to continue. Alex, we've embedded assumptions about return to the office in our guidance, and they're slightly more conservative than they were in the prior couple of quarters. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and we see it all over the place with companies trying to figure out and employees trying to figure out the degree to which they'll go back to the office. So we think that the return to the office is going to be slightly less than we would have thought 90 days ago or 180 days ago, and that's embedded in our numbers. We also think, though, that there's other things that are going on as a result of the way people are looking at their office space usage that are going to help our business, significant opportunity in project management. We continue to be there -- I believe there's going to be significant opportunity in the flex space arena where we've invested in Industrious. And our big clients all over the world are telling us that. And all of those assumptions are embedded in what we've modeled for our business. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll speak with you again at the end of the first quarter when we give the results for that period."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Kristyn Farahmand, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Thank you, you may begin.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone and welcome to CBRE\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks, as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Please note, we have added some new details to our real estate investment segment tab. Before we kickoff today\u2019s call, I will remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE\u2019s future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy, and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS and the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic, the integration and performance of acquisitions and other transactions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue, and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanation of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning\u2019s call will be as follows. First, I will provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO will discuss our recent strategic investments and how they support our four-dimension diversification strategy. Then, Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial and Investment Officer will discuss the quarter in detail along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities and balance sheet strength, then we'll open up the call for questions. Now, please turn to Slide four, which highlights our third quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew approximately 20% to a new third quarter record of about $6.8 billion, while net revenue grew over 28% to nearly $4.2 billion. Notably, all our advisory service business lines, including leasing generated more revenue than they did in Q3 2019. The quarter also benefited from the work we completed last year on our cost structure as well as our continued financial discipline. Overall, GAAP EPS rose nearly 135% to $1.28, while adjusted EPS grew about 92% to $1.39, compared with Q3 2019. These metrics are up approximately 71% and 76%, respectively. Now for deeper insights, please turn to Slide six for Bob's remarks. Bob?\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. The diversification of our business across four dimensions, asset types, business lines, clients and geographic markets has been a key focus of our past few earnings calls. The benefits of this diversification were clearly evident in our third quarter performance, with adjusted EBITDA more than 60% above the Q3 2019 peak, record Q3 margins and strong top-line growth across all global regions. Our leaders around the world have been adept at identifying and securing compelling opportunities to grow our business across the four dimensions of diversification. We have committed approximately $2 billion of capital already this year to secularly favored areas including green energy and infrastructure project management, with our Turner & Townsend investment, Flex office solutions with our industry investment and logistics and multifamily assets in a real estate investment segment. These investments position as well to make additional capital and organic investments that will drive earnings growth for years to come. We're also making substantial investments to grow our business organically. These include deeper asset type specialization in both our brokerage and real estate investment management businesses, and client sector specialization in our GWS business. And we're expanding our real estate development business into new international markets. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, as well as the work we've done to streamline costs and capture the benefits of scale, we are positioned to continue growth initiatives like these well into the future. At the same time, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders and are evaluating all potential avenues for such returns. I will close by noting that we will update our multi-year growth framework when we report Q4 results in February. Now I'll hand the call over to Emma.\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, let's start with our advisory segment. This segment rebounded strongly from the pandemic's depressed levels of Q3 2020 and performed very well compared with pre-pandemic activity in 2019. In my comments today I will include compared with Q3 2019 for the transactional business lines. We believe this is the best barometer of how these business lines are faring. Advisory services net revenue and operating profits set new third quarter records, surpassing the Q3 2019 peak by 13% and 29%, respectively. This strong performance reflects not only our ability to capture reviving demand for real estate services, but also our diligent focus on managing costs during the recovery. The strong operating profit growth also reflects a $7.5 million gain from our industrious investment. Leasing continued to bounce back strongly, particularly outside of the U.S. with global revenue up 58% from Q3 2020 and 7% from the Q3 2019 peak. All three regions generated leasing revenue above Q3 2019 peak levels, up 4% in the Americas, 20% in EMIA and 11% in APAC. Office demand in the U.S. continues to trail pre-pandemic levels. However, the shortfalls from the 2019 peak levels narrowed to just 16% in Q3 versus 54% in q2. We also continued to see strong small deal performance with revenue from U.S. leasing transactions below $1 million, up about 8% versus Q3 2019. While the contribution from large deals over $1 million remained about 5% below its pre-pandemic level. Property sales activity remained robust. All regions exceeded their pre-pandemic peaks with global property sales up 93% from Q3 2020 and 27% from the Q3 2019 peak. Like in leasing, U.S. office sales activity saw significant improvement coming in just 16% below Q3 2019 levels versus 31% in Q2, and improved investment market also helped generate strong growth and commercial mortgage origination. Revenue rose 41%, from Q3 2020 and 11% from the Q3 2019 peak. Both the government agencies and private lenders were noticeably more active in Q3. We expect the agency's higher lending caps for 2022 coupled with a healthy appetite from private lenders and the attractive yields available from real estate debt to provide a supportive backdrop heading into next year. Strong origination activity helped to drive a 19% increase versus the prior quarter in our loan servicing portfolio, which reached [$300 billion] [ph] at quarter's end, the portfolio growth propelled a 35% revenue increase from the prior year Q3. Valuation revenue accelerated more than 27% from last year's quarter, partially reflecting particularly strong growth in the U.K. and Ireland. Property Management revenue increased 6% year-over-year. Moving to Slide nine, our global workplace solutions segment again posted solid revenue in segment operating profit growth across its global business base. Revenue rose over 8% from Q3 2020, comprised of 21% growth in project management and 6% in facilities management. Total GWS segment, operating profits rose over 16% compared with Q3 2020. Our local client business was a standout performer accounting for a quarter of total segment operating profits. This growth has been driven in part by selective infill M&A. Importantly, despite evidence of increased inflation throughout the economy, we believe our GWS business is well protected by contract provisions that enable us to factor inflation into our pricing annually or even more frequently in certain cases. We are optimistic about the future growth trajectory of GWS. Our new business pipeline is growing, and remains well diversified with representation from financial services, industrial life sciences and technology clients. The pipeline increased markedly from Q2 and is up from both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019. We expect continued pipeline strength as the business environment increasingly settles into a new normal. Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investments segment continued to deliver strong growth, with segment operating profit nearly matching last quarter\u2019s record level. This performance reflects how well positioned our development and investment management businesses are to capitalize on the strong investment climate and the flow of capital into industrial, multifamily, and other favorite asset classes. Global development generated nearly $100 million of operating profit in the third quarter primarily driven by selling industrial properties at high valuations, reflecting acid and tenant quality as well as strong market fundamentals. Industrious comprises the largest portion of our in-process portfolio and pipeline at 35% and 39%, respectively, and we continue adding new projects to the pipeline at a strong pace. This will drive revenue and profit opportunities for years to come. On a trailing 12 month basis, we have converted the average value of the in-process portfolio to operating profit at a rate of 1.9% which is toward the high end of the historical range. Importantly, our in-process portfolio set another new high this quarter, rising to $16.8 billion, largely driven by multifamily activity. Investment management benefited from a record level of asset management fees as well as higher incentive acquisition and disposition fees, compared with Q3 2020, revenue rose 35% to $135 million, while operating profit increased 68% to $49 million. Assets under management continued to grow steadily rising to over $133 billion despite negative currency effects. Industrious and logistics properties remain the largest asset class in the portfolio, comprising more than $35 billion of AUM, or over 26% of the total. Fundraising also remained strong as the performance of our funds and separate accounts attract new capital, dry powder rose 6%, from Q2 to $13.2 billion. Looking at the business as a whole, we're on track to surpass 2019 record performance across all key financial metrics by a substantial margin. On Slide 11, we'll briefly walk through our revised qualitative 2021 outlook. We now expect full year Global Advisory sales revenue to be about 15% above the 2019 peak and globally seem to fall 5% or so short of peak. Q4 will likely see more moderate sales and leasing growth rates than we've experienced the last few quarters as prior year comparisons become tougher. However, both U.S. sales and leasing have been running well ahead of 2019 peak levels thus far in October. Across the rest of our advisory business, we reiterate expectations for low double digit revenue growth on a combined basis. We also anticipate stronger incremental margin expansion than we previously forecast due to the more robust revenue growth. The Q4 net margin should be around the 22.7% achieved in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect the benefit of more revenue from high margin business lines will likely be offset by increased discretionary spending to drive growth and by lower OMSR gains compared with Q4 2020. In GWS, we expect mid-to-high single-digit net revenue growth accompanied by operating profit growth of 20% or more year-over-year. Before contributions from the Turner & Townsend transaction. Our policy is to reflect transactions once closed. Currently, we expect this transaction to close early next week. Given this timing we anticipate the transaction will contribute about $160 million to $170 million in revenue and about $20 million to $25 million in operating profit to our 2021 consolidated results. November and December are usually seasonably light months for the company. For calendar year 2021, Turner & Townsend is expected to generate roughly $1 billion in net revenue at the current spot rate at a similar operating profit margin to their prior fiscal year. Importantly, they noted previously our broader GWS new business pipeline is building and we expect to see the benefit from this in 2022 and beyond. For REI, we have raised their expectations modestly driven by investment management. We now expect this business lines revenue to rise in the low to mid-teens range and its operating profit to increase by at least 30% versus 2020. This includes some incremental OpEx investments slated for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect global development operating profits to roughly triple the $122 million generated in 2019. This reflexive movement of some transactions previously expected to close in Q3 to Q4. We are developing properties and markets and sectors with strong underlying fundamentals and expect to continue monetizing these assets in Q4 and for the next several years. As we've noted in past quarters, corporate segment expenses will be up from both 2019 and 2020 and are expected to end the year at just over 2% of total net revenue. Year-to-date, discretionary operating expenses have been trending well below pre-COVID levels. However, we expect some of these expenses to gradually return as business activity recovers. Flipping to Slide 12, we've strengthened our balance sheet while committing approximately $2 billion thus far in 2021 to long-term growth initiatives, while also returning $188 million to shareholders through repurchases. Trailing 12-month free cash flow generation reached a company record at over $1.9 billion. As a result, we ended the quarter with a net cash position of 0.3 turns and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. We expect to maintain our net cash position in Q4 even with our initial payment for our stake in Turner & Townsend, which will be about $700 million. We will continue to prioritize investments and enhance our diversification, resiliency, and long run growth trajectory. Going forward, we are poised to continue investing in our growth while returning capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our market leading position, the underlying momentum in our business and our substantial balance sheet capacity, make us very excited about our future growth prospects. We look forward to closing out 2021 with another strong quarter. With that operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Rosivach: Hey, everybody, thanks for taking my call. And congrats again for an amazing quarter. One, just really small housekeeping question. You had an increase in stock compensation expense in the quarter. Is that something that's just contractual that's just related to the stock being up 70% this year and the performance that you've had?\nEmma Giamartino: So yes, we've put in place $100 million buyback this quarter, but going forward buybacks will be a part of our capital allocation strategy. And we're going to balance it with the remainder of our -- of how we look at we allocate our capital across M&A and organic investments, but it is a part of a programmatic buyback.\nKristyn Farahmand: And then, hey, Andrew, this is Kristyn, just to jump in for a moment. You're right. The increase in stock compensation expense is basically purely a result of the fact that the financial performance has been so robust.\nAndrew Rosivach: Got it. So if it were going to -- the only reason why we repeat again in 2022 would be again if CBRE had outstanding performance.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes.\nAndrew Rosivach: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, thanks. Good morning. My first question regards inflation and was wondering if you can comment on just the overall effect on the business and whether that brings some costs that you had caught last year back a little bit sooner. And then, the second part of the inflation question for me relates to GWS and whether there's a material impact on things like maybe incentive contracts, where you may begin to earn money if you saved the client, certain costs, but maybe that's harder now because of inflation.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, absolutely. So I think I'll comment overall on our business, we feel very comfortable that we're well positioned to weather inflationary pressures across our business. I did mention in my remarks that we see a natural hedge within our GWS contracts overall and then we also see a natural hedge in other parts of our business with property management, for example. So within property management, as rents rise, as inflation rises, our revenue in property management also rises. And then, on the transactional side of the business, it tends to benefit from inflation. Given that inflation tends to only happen when the economy is expanding, so across all those businesses, we feel very comfortable that we can weather the inflationary environment. And I will note that the one business that we are monitoring and focused on is our development business. And but what we've seen so far is that the very strong valuations in that business have more than offset any inflationary pressures.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then, on the leasing side, it sounds like office is improving, but still below prior peaks, can you give us a sense as to what that order of magnitude is right now, or perhaps even what the leasing revenue for you all in dollars would be if office got back to normal?\nKristyn Farahmand: So I don't think we're prepared to throw out a specific number right now. But we feel really good about the leasing trajectory so far during October for the U.S.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. But as compared to say prior peaks, this is off like 5% or 30%, or just any order of magnitude?\nKristyn Farahmand: So, we haven't been more specific than to talk specifically just about U.S. leasing overall. We haven't drilled down into property type, and I don't think we want to get that granular right now. But we did identify the fact that U.S. leasing so far is actually trending above the prior 2019 peaks so far in the month of October.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then, last question, in REI, you laid out the expected growth between investment management and development. Just wondering, I think, when you have your supplemental disclosure, you show also like an overhead, I guess amount in Hana kind of losses, is there, a piece of that we should think about as well to net into sort of those brackets.\nEmma Giamartino: We expect those Hana losses to continue to decline, we've transferred that business over to industrious, and we're still holding some leases, but the occupancy in those leases continues to increase. So as that increases those losses to decline over the next year.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. But if I just thinking about the REI segment in totality, if I just do the up 30% that you laid out, and then the triple on development that gets us to about $548 million for the year, do we have to net some amount of overhead against that for that segment operating profit, or is that the number?\nKristyn Farahmand: No, you would have to net some overhead against that in some minor continuing Hana losses. We didn't specifically guide to that number. But I think you can probably look at the last few quarters to get an idea.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Bob or Emma, was just curious if you could maybe share your thoughts on just office in general and the commentary and comments you're having with seniors about bringing people back to the office, how they're using work, hybrid work, what that means for the office long-term and just sort of how that dovetails in with your industrious investment?\nBob Sulentic: Well, that's a complex question, Steve. The industrious investment, we believe is a bit of a hedge against -- not even a bit a significant hedge against what we've said now for some time is that we expect there to be some downward pressure on the office product type relative to where it has been historically. But we've studied this flex dynamic over and over and over and spent a huge amount of time with our occupier clients. And the general view is that they expect flex space to be a bigger portion of their office space used going forward than it has been historically and landlords are expected to be a fixture in their buildings in general going forward. So we think the future for industrious is quite bright. We voted with our pocketbook as they stay when we invested in that business and we're prepared to make an incremental investments to support their growth. We're quite bullish about what might happen with industrious. As it relates to the Office product type in general, I think our company and our own plans about what to do with our people is a bit of a proxy for what's going on in the marketplace. There's uncertainty we had thought we would have a significant return to the office kind of inflection point after Labor Day, because people were more and more aimed at getting their teams back into the office for all the reasons we know, collaboration, culture et cetera. When the Delta variant came, it pushed that back, we now think that inflection point is probably going to be the first of the year. And we think people will come back to the office in the same way they would have come back to the office had the Delta variant not occurred. And our view that we've articulated for the past several quarters is, that's going to be something like 80%, 85%, of where it was before. But again, we're all trying to figure out what the future of office space is going to be. But we believe what we've really seen is a delay from Labor Day to the first of the year. And I can tell you, I interface with a lot of clients, interface with a lot of CEOs and talk to them about their plans in general. They believe that getting back to the office in a significant way, not all the way back to where they were before there will be hybrid work going on long into the future. But getting back significantly is in people's plans. And we think that's going to impact our business positively. One thing is, I believe, close to not arguable what we're seeing today is not as good as what we're going to see in the future as it relates to office buildings. We're still significantly impacted by COVID. But as you saw the GAAP between peak leashing performance in the office sector in the third quarter was meaningfully smaller than it was in the second quarter.\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks. And then maybe a question for Emma. I just wanted to circle back on the buybacks because, I think you did ramp up activity and in the third quarter. And I think either in the last call or the call before you guys had talked about maybe having a bit more of a programmatic share buyback program. And given that your leverage is below zero, I mean, is that something we should be thinking about that $100 million is being a bit of a placeholder for buybacks.\nEmma Giamartino: So we're at the point right now, where we're obviously in a very positive net cash position at 0.3 turns. We've generated a record amount of free cash flow over the last 12 months. So we're very happy with our balance sheet position and our free cash flow generation. And we're really taking the time to reassess what our capital allocation strategy is and how we're going to return cash to shareholders. And so we think we're in a really strong position, we're still very focused on looking for avenues to invest in our company, both organically and through M&A where we can drive growth and resiliency. And we're going to do some more work around how we balance that with cash return to shareholders and so I'm not yet ready to speak about it more specifically. But as we continue to evolve our thinking, we'll be sure to be transparent with all of you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\nStephen Sheldon: Hey, good morning. Thanks. It sounds like you've seen a pretty big sequential step up in the GWS pipeline, but what's driving the slightly lower growth outlook for GWS now in 2021, I think mid-to-high single digits, now I think you talked about high single digits previously, and how big of an issue are labor challenges in that business and your ability to staff and I guess launch new contracts?\nBob Sulentic: I don't think labor challenges are causing problems in terms of launching new contracts. They are causing some challenges in terms of staffing, we and our clients are like everybody else. There's a real war for talent and it's impacting the things we do. What you're seeing on the rebuild of the pipeline and slightly relative downward pressure we've seen on the growth trajectory of the enterprise portion of our outsourcing business is that people have found it difficult to make decisions not knowing what's going to go on with office space. And they found it difficult to make decisions because they aren't in the office together coordinating all the things you need to coordinate to make massive commitments, the way outsourcing contracts require you to make to move forward at the pace we're moving forward before. These commitments that these occupiers are making on these outsourcing contracts can be multi-billion-dollar commitments over years. And so when the teams that are dealing with the strategy and the procurement teams and the C suite aren't in the office interfacing with each other aren't certain about where they're going to go, things slow down. Now we're seeing a market increased -- a significant increase in our pipeline from where we were a year ago, which is indicative of the fact that people are getting back to being able to make these decisions with a little more clarity. But that's really what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline where it was year ago, where it was two years ago and where it is now.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. Makes sense. And then I guess on the transactional business lines, I guess, what are you seeing in capital markets and leasing pipelines heading into the seasonally important fourth quarter? And are you starting to get, I guess any visibility in the transactional businesses, as you look into the early part of 2022?\nBob Sulentic: There is a huge amount of capital out there trying to get into the real estate space. And that's particularly true with industrial assets with life sciences, assets, with multifamily assets and even with office assets that are high quality and have the right tendency. So we think this year has been a great year for capital markets for both sales and financing. And we think we're going to have another great year next year. The trajectory on leasing is very positive, the quarter-over-quarter trajectory and compare to peak year is very positive. And so we believe next year will be a good year for leasing. How good it's going to unfold as we go through the fourth quarter. I will tell you that October has been very encouraging.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over Bob Sulentic for any closing remarks.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you again when we report our year end numbers.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

On Slide 11, we'll briefly walk through our revised qualitative 2021 outlook. We now expect full year Global Advisory sales revenue to be about 15% above the 2019 peak and globally seem to fall 5% or so short of peak. Q4 will likely see more moderate sales and leasing growth rates than we've experienced the last few quarters as prior year comparisons become tougher. However, both U.S. sales and leasing have been running well ahead of 2019 peak levels thus far in October. Across the rest of our advisory business, we reiterate expectations for low double digit revenue growth on a combined basis. We also anticipate stronger incremental margin expansion than we previously forecast due to the more robust revenue growth. The Q4 net margin should be around the 22.7% achieved in the prior year fourth quarter. We expect the benefit of more revenue from high margin business lines will likely be offset by increased discretionary spending to drive growth and by lower OMSR gains compared with Q4 2020. In GWS, we expect mid-to-high single-digit net revenue growth accompanied by operating profit growth of 20% or more year-over-year. Before contributions from the Turner & Townsend transaction. Our policy is to reflect transactions once closed. Currently, we expect this transaction to close early next week. Given this timing we anticipate the transaction will contribute about $160 million to $170 million in revenue and about $20 million to $25 million in operating profit to our 2021 consolidated results. November and December are usually seasonably light months for the company. For calendar year 2021, Turner & Townsend is expected to generate roughly $1 billion in net revenue at the current spot rate at a similar operating profit margin to their prior fiscal year. Importantly, they noted previously our broader GWS new business pipeline is building and we expect to see the benefit from this in 2022 and beyond. For REI, we have raised their expectations modestly driven by investment management. We now expect this business lines revenue to rise in the low to mid-teens range and its operating profit to increase by at least 30% versus 2020. This includes some incremental OpEx investments slated for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect global development operating profits to roughly triple the $122 million generated in 2019. This reflexive movement of some transactions previously expected to close in Q3 to Q4. We are developing properties and markets and sectors with strong underlying fundamentals and expect to continue monetizing these assets in Q4 and for the next several years. As we've noted in past quarters, corporate segment expenses will be up from both 2019 and 2020 and are expected to end the year at just over 2% of total net revenue. Year-to-date, discretionary operating expenses have been trending well below pre-COVID levels. However, we expect some of these expenses to gradually return as business activity recovers. Flipping to Slide 12, we've strengthened our balance sheet while committing approximately $2 billion thus far in 2021 to long-term growth initiatives, while also returning $188 million to shareholders through repurchases. Trailing 12-month free cash flow generation reached a company record at over $1.9 billion. As a result, we ended the quarter with a net cash position of 0.3 turns and nearly $6 billion of liquidity. We expect to maintain our net cash position in Q4 even with our initial payment for our stake in Turner & Townsend, which will be about $700 million. We will continue to prioritize investments and enhance our diversification, resiliency, and long run growth trajectory. Going forward, we are poised to continue investing in our growth while returning capital to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our market leading position, the underlying momentum in our business and our substantial balance sheet capacity, make us very excited about our future growth prospects. We look forward to closing out 2021 with another strong quarter. With that operator, please open the line for questions. So yes, we've put in place $100 million buyback this quarter, but going forward buybacks will be a part of our capital allocation strategy. And we're going to balance it with the remainder of our -- of how we look at we allocate our capital across M&A and organic investments, but it is a part of a programmatic buyback. Yes. Yes, absolutely. So I think I'll comment overall on our business, we feel very comfortable that we're well positioned to weather inflationary pressures across our business. I did mention in my remarks that we see a natural hedge within our GWS contracts overall and then we also see a natural hedge in other parts of our business with property management, for example. So within property management, as rents rise, as inflation rises, our revenue in property management also rises. And then, on the transactional side of the business, it tends to benefit from inflation. Given that inflation tends to only happen when the economy is expanding, so across all those businesses, we feel very comfortable that we can weather the inflationary environment. And I will note that the one business that we are monitoring and focused on is our development business. And but what we've seen so far is that the very strong valuations in that business have more than offset any inflationary pressures. We expect those Hana losses to continue to decline, we've transferred that business over to industrious, and we're still holding some leases, but the occupancy in those leases continues to increase. So as that increases those losses to decline over the next year. So we're at the point right now, where we're obviously in a very positive net cash position at 0.3 turns. We've generated a record amount of free cash flow over the last 12 months. So we're very happy with our balance sheet position and our free cash flow generation. And we're really taking the time to reassess what our capital allocation strategy is and how we're going to return cash to shareholders. And so we think we're in a really strong position, we're still very focused on looking for avenues to invest in our company, both organically and through M&A where we can drive growth and resiliency. And we're going to do some more work around how we balance that with cash return to shareholders and so I'm not yet ready to speak about it more specifically. But as we continue to evolve our thinking, we'll be sure to be transparent with all of you."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristyn, and good morning, everyone. The diversification of our business across four dimensions, asset types, business lines, clients and geographic markets has been a key focus of our past few earnings calls. The benefits of this diversification were clearly evident in our third quarter performance, with adjusted EBITDA more than 60% above the Q3 2019 peak, record Q3 margins and strong top-line growth across all global regions. Our leaders around the world have been adept at identifying and securing compelling opportunities to grow our business across the four dimensions of diversification. We have committed approximately $2 billion of capital already this year to secularly favored areas including green energy and infrastructure project management, with our Turner & Townsend investment, Flex office solutions with our industry investment and logistics and multifamily assets in a real estate investment segment. These investments position as well to make additional capital and organic investments that will drive earnings growth for years to come. We're also making substantial investments to grow our business organically. These include deeper asset type specialization in both our brokerage and real estate investment management businesses, and client sector specialization in our GWS business. And we're expanding our real estate development business into new international markets. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, as well as the work we've done to streamline costs and capture the benefits of scale, we are positioned to continue growth initiatives like these well into the future. At the same time, we are committed to returning cash to our shareholders and are evaluating all potential avenues for such returns. I will close by noting that we will update our multi-year growth framework when we report Q4 results in February. Now I'll hand the call over to Emma. Well, that's a complex question, Steve. The industrious investment, we believe is a bit of a hedge against -- not even a bit a significant hedge against what we've said now for some time is that we expect there to be some downward pressure on the office product type relative to where it has been historically. But we've studied this flex dynamic over and over and over and spent a huge amount of time with our occupier clients. And the general view is that they expect flex space to be a bigger portion of their office space used going forward than it has been historically and landlords are expected to be a fixture in their buildings in general going forward. So we think the future for industrious is quite bright. We voted with our pocketbook as they stay when we invested in that business and we're prepared to make an incremental investments to support their growth. We're quite bullish about what might happen with industrious. As it relates to the Office product type in general, I think our company and our own plans about what to do with our people is a bit of a proxy for what's going on in the marketplace. There's uncertainty we had thought we would have a significant return to the office kind of inflection point after Labor Day, because people were more and more aimed at getting their teams back into the office for all the reasons we know, collaboration, culture et cetera. When the Delta variant came, it pushed that back, we now think that inflection point is probably going to be the first of the year. And we think people will come back to the office in the same way they would have come back to the office had the Delta variant not occurred. And our view that we've articulated for the past several quarters is, that's going to be something like 80%, 85%, of where it was before. But again, we're all trying to figure out what the future of office space is going to be. But we believe what we've really seen is a delay from Labor Day to the first of the year. And I can tell you, I interface with a lot of clients, interface with a lot of CEOs and talk to them about their plans in general. They believe that getting back to the office in a significant way, not all the way back to where they were before there will be hybrid work going on long into the future. But getting back significantly is in people's plans. And we think that's going to impact our business positively. One thing is, I believe, close to not arguable what we're seeing today is not as good as what we're going to see in the future as it relates to office buildings. We're still significantly impacted by COVID. But as you saw the GAAP between peak leashing performance in the office sector in the third quarter was meaningfully smaller than it was in the second quarter. I don't think labor challenges are causing problems in terms of launching new contracts. They are causing some challenges in terms of staffing, we and our clients are like everybody else. There's a real war for talent and it's impacting the things we do. What you're seeing on the rebuild of the pipeline and slightly relative downward pressure we've seen on the growth trajectory of the enterprise portion of our outsourcing business is that people have found it difficult to make decisions not knowing what's going to go on with office space. And they found it difficult to make decisions because they aren't in the office together coordinating all the things you need to coordinate to make massive commitments, the way outsourcing contracts require you to make to move forward at the pace we're moving forward before. These commitments that these occupiers are making on these outsourcing contracts can be multi-billion-dollar commitments over years. And so when the teams that are dealing with the strategy and the procurement teams and the C suite aren't in the office interfacing with each other aren't certain about where they're going to go, things slow down. Now we're seeing a market increased -- a significant increase in our pipeline from where we were a year ago, which is indicative of the fact that people are getting back to being able to make these decisions with a little more clarity. But that's really what you're seeing in terms of the pipeline where it was year ago, where it was two years ago and where it is now. There is a huge amount of capital out there trying to get into the real estate space. And that's particularly true with industrial assets with life sciences, assets, with multifamily assets and even with office assets that are high quality and have the right tendency. So we think this year has been a great year for capital markets for both sales and financing. And we think we're going to have another great year next year. The trajectory on leasing is very positive, the quarter-over-quarter trajectory and compare to peak year is very positive. And so we believe next year will be a good year for leasing. How good it's going to unfold as we go through the fourth quarter. I will tell you that October has been very encouraging. Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to talking with you again when we report our year end numbers."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Kristyn Farahmand, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Thank you, you may begin.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone and welcome to CBRE\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks, as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Separately we also announced some changes to our leadership team appointing Emma Giamartino as Global Group President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Investment Officer and Vikram Kohli as Global Group President, Business Intelligence.  Before we kickoff today\u2019s call, I will remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE\u2019s future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy, and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS in the effects of both cost savings initiatives and the COVID pandemic, the integration and performance of acquisitions, and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue, and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanation of these measures in the appendix of this presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning\u2019s call will be as follows. First, I will provide an overview of our quarterly financial results. Next, Bob Sulentic our President and CEO will provide insight on our Q2 performance, the recently announced Turner & Townsend transaction, and today\u2019s senior leadership changes. Following Bob\u2019s remarks Emma will discuss the quarter in detail along with our revised qualitative outlook for 2021, our capital deployment activities, and broader investment strategy. Then we will open up the call for questions.  Now please turn to Slide 4 which highlights our second quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 20% to a new second quarter record of nearly $6.5 billion while net revenue grew 31% to $3.9 billion partially driven by a strong rebound in property build and to a lesser extent leasing as well as favorable foreign currency effect. The quarter also saw a tangible benefit from last year's transformation initiative which have improved our cost structure and operational agility. Adjusted EBITDA grew 169% to $718 million surpassing Q2 2019 total by 53%. Overall adjusted EPS grew 291% to 136 while GAAP EPS rose 437% to 130. Compared with Q2 2019 these metrics were up 68% and 98% respectively. Both adjusted and GAAP EPS in the prior year second quarter included a $0.10 headwind from incremental COVID related costs and a charitable contribution to COVID relief effort. Additionally, certain venture capital investments contributed $0.02 to GAAP and adjusted EPS this quarter. In fact, all key financial metrics significantly surpassed Q2 2019 levels as a testament to the resiliency of our business and the actions we have taken to create a business primed to deliver scalable and enduring home [ph].  Now for deeper insight please turn to Slide 6 for Bob\u2019s remarks. Bob. \nBob Sulentic: Thanks Kristyn and good morning everyone. As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across four dimensions; asset type, business line, client type, and geography. We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend. Overall Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all three business segments. Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this two-year period due to our disciplined expense management along with the benefits of diversification. Thoughtful investments shaped by a well-developed strategy will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type, and geography. Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerged from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly failed [ph] companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE. You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Industrious in the Flex space arena and again this month with our SPACs sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project, program, and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long term growth profiles. Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the four dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our client\u2019s carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now. Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere. And they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year.  Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business. The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli, the Global Group President roles, represents another step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy. Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma, he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact based decisions as we guide the company's growth. Vikram is the first senior executives from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. in the senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions.  Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth transition of financial leadership responsibilities. I want to thank Leah for her vision and initiating the transformation of our finance organization, managing finance through the worst of the COVID 19 crisis, and together with Kristyn taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success. With that I'll turn the call over to Emma.\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO. With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records, rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed their previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18% respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued America's office leasing. Overall, leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA, and 40% in APAC. Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing, with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019.  As expected, property sales improved markedly, with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA, APAC property sales revenue was 158%, 132%, and 151% respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 level, with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019. The macroeconomic backdrop is supported by real estate investments and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also help to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw a particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization. Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus the prior year and 3% sequentially to over 294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans, brokered and originated despite loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Evaluating revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S. with evaluation revenue increase nearly 47%. Finally, property management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly while Americas lagged due to a previous decision to exit some low margin contracts.  Moving to Slide 9, Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management up 15% and facilities management up 10% driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments, as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation. Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mixed shift to higher margin work, and the impact of last year of transformation initiatives, which more than offset increased medical expenses. Even accounting for about 17 million of transitory COVID related expenses in last year Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified, with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics, and technology companies along with new data center activities.  Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investment segment generated over 152 million of segment operating profits surpassing its previous quarterly high by 38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly 120 million was fueled by a large office property sale that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and tenant fees. Importantly, our pipeline and in process portfolio both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion and $15.2 billion respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee based office and industrial work for blue chip occupier clients.  Investment management revenue grew 35% to 139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest, and favorable FX translation. Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%. Lastly, Hana\u2019s operating loss narrowed sequentially to 9 million. We expect the further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious. And all Hana sites except for four legacy units are now owned by Industrious. The future financial impact of our Industrious stake, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes will be reflected in advisory.  On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak. We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill. As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start where we continue to monitor the potential Delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months, that office leasing is highly correlated with companies returning to the office. Given this, as we have started to see some U.S. based companies modestly delay return to office space, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the strong recovery we've seen quarter-to-date.  Across the rest of our advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double digit range versus the high single digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations. Moving to GWS, we are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profits while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we expect GWS segment operating profit to grow at around a high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations. Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second half, and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner & Townsend transaction.  Looking at REI, we expect this segment to nearly double 2020s record high profitability. In investment management we expect revenue to surpass [Technical Difficulty] and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the 140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more than double versus 2020, and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of 122 million. They are developing product in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals and have a solid pipeline for asset monetization. This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019 even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses, as compared to that year. The return of high margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives, and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook. Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peaks of $3.71 to have wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half our earnings in the second half, but given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years.  Moving to Slide 12, over the last year we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships, and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transactions, while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares. Still net leverage remains modest at 0.2 times pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have a significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four pronged investment approach, convincing of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions, and building our own resources and capabilities. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading position give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come.  Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspiration we outlined in February, at least low double digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025, absent a downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation. With that operator please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. \nAnthony Paolone: Thanks. Good morning and welcome Emma to the mix here. My first question is just to clarify a comment you made about first half versus second half earnings. Is that to mean that the first half of 2021 will be greater than what you think the second half will be or just that the splits a little bit more even, if I understood the comment?\nEmma Giamartino: It\u2019s that the split will be a little bit more even. So the first half comp versus 2020 obviously is much easier than the second half. We are expecting a shift in our earnings to be more weighted, to move more towards the first half, so we still expect the majority of it to be in the second half.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, I understand. And then, on the leasing side, I guess that's not picked up as much as capital markets, but just interested in maybe your view as to whether it's just capital markets activity is surprised on the upside or if leasing is maybe under-performing expectations?\nBob Sulentic: Tony, I would say it's both. Capital markets is doing quite well. There is a huge amount of capital interested in commercial real estate, obviously aimed at certain asset classes, for instance, anything related to industrial distribution, multifamily data centers. There is a lot of capital aimed at those assets, lot of trading going on and obviously we're big in those arenas. So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's a real uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID and as long as that overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now, as you've seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions were being made, commitments were being made, but we're -- I would say we can be certain about two things, we probably won't go back to where we were pre-COVID, but we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15 months, right. The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted and that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. Do you have a sense as to where your office leasing revenue ran in the second quarter versus say 2019 levels, because it seemed like a lot of the other areas are above?\nEmma Giamartino: So office leasing revenue came down to 47% of our total leasing revenues globally and 2020 it was 54%. So it came down 7%. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay, got it. And then just last one from me on the investment activity, you've announced or completed so far this year, particularly as it relates to Turner & Townsend, can you get a sense as to like what the aggregate EBITDA contribution is likely to be from that, I know you gave some numbers with Turner & Townsend in terms of the trailing, just trying to understand if like you anticipate cost saves or forward growth, just trying to understand like what the pickup is likely to be for you all from the capital being put out the door?\nEmma Giamartino: Yeah, so historically Turner & Townsend has shown very consistent mid-teens growth, both to net revenue and EBITDA. And through 2021, you probably saw their revenue was pretty flat. They only dropped 3% and EBITDA was up significantly. So going forward, we're expecting them to continue to hit those mid double digit revenue, mid-teens revenue and EBITDA but I will say that for 2022, we are expecting EBITDA to be in line with 2021 as costs come back in post COVID, even as revenue increases.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And anything substantial from the other investments you've made in terms of EBITDA contribution?\nEmma Giamartino: No, we have done a few intel acquisitions for Industrious. We have not revalued that investment because it was the reason we expect to do that later that year. So you won't see any impact from Industrious this year. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay, great. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks, good morning, and welcome Emma. I guess first question maybe for Bob, when you sort of looked at Turner & Townsend, I'm just wondering can you just sort of talk a little bit about how the contracts that they have are structured maybe more from just the length of contract and maybe contrast it to the contracts you have in the GWS business, it looks like there are EBITDA margins much higher than what you have in GWS, but I'm just trying to understand maybe the length of contract and the cyclicality of that business?\nBob Sulentic: That business has not been cyclical. As Emma said, they'd been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on, and one of the things Steve that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds. So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So, the decision making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, they're about what their long-term needs are. So we expect this to be an acquisition that contributes to the resiliency of our business. They operated at different margin level because they don't have the same level of pass throughs we do. For instance, one thing they don't do is principal contracting which we do which of course has big pass throughs. But they're doing some massive projects around the world. To give you an example, they're doing a hydro project in New South Wales in Australia. That will be the largest renewable project in the country of Australia ever. They're doing the -- they're working on the Virgin Hybrid listed so well known in India that's going to connect the big cities in India, that will go on for years and years and years. My guess is their role in that will grow over time. They're involved in the program management, then the ongoing cost management when they take on projects like this. So they're very resilient and they are a high margin company and they are real grower.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. So is it fair to say that contracts are at least as long, maybe longer than what you would typically see in your GWS business?\nBob Sulentic: Oh yeah, big complex projects like that last for years and years. I'll give you another example, they're working on a $6 billion redevelopment at the Toronto airport. Any of us that have gone to airports and seen these projects know they just, they go on for a long time. So yes, those contracts are very long-term.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. And then when you just sort of look at the balance sheet capacity that you've got, obviously very under levered, and you're looking to deploy capital. I mean, do you expect to sort of find other deals like Turner & Townsend or do you expect to do more small tuck-in acquisitions in the advisory business or on the development side, I'm just trying to get more of a strategic sense for where you'll deploy kind of the next large chunks of capital or is it more into buybacks, how do we think about that?\nEmma Giamartino: Yeah. So we still have a very strong M&A pipeline. I think we are going to look to do more deals like Turner & Townsend, we will also continue to do our programmatic M&A through in sell. But I think you'll see a mix of both and our real focus is on finding targets that can really help push our strategy forward, our diversification strategy across asset types, business lines, client types, and geographies that Bob has talked about with all of you many times. And so we're going to look for strategic M&A, we're not going to force it. If we can't find the right opportunities, we'll obviously look to return cash to shareholders. \nSteve Sakwa: Got it. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. To what extent do you think that the surge in capital markets reflects prior transactions that perhaps either were postponed or put on hold, took longer to close things of that nature, just getting questions from investors about sustainability of the capital markets growth that you're seeing?\nBob Sulentic: Yeah Jade, there was some pent up demand that came through in the marketplace, but when you ask about capital markets in the real commercial real estate sector, you have to look at the alternative places capital can go. And as you know, there is a lot of capital around the world and prices are high in most asset classes, stocks, etcetera. And so real estate has proven to be a much better asset class over the last decade and there were certain portions, certain asset classes within real estate that appear to be particularly strong. And we've talked about them over and over multi-family, data centers, anything industrial, anything by the way in the office arena that are new high quality buildings with great tenants, especially tech tenants. There's a lot of capital for those buildings still. And so what you're seeing is a lot of capital out there in general, a considerable portion of it that\u2019s concluded that commercial real estate is a good place to be and then some asset classes within commercial real estate that appear to be performing extremely well with lots of headway to continue to perform well. And so, there was a little pent-up demand coming through, but our view is that this is going to sustain for years.\nJade Rahmani: And can you talk to the mix perhaps across the overall revenue profile of CBRE today by property type, how much would be derived from office, how much would be from those other sectors that you've mentioned?\nEmma Giamartino: So on the -- I gave some of the stats on leasing before. We're at 47% office globally, 32% industrial. On the sales side office is down to 18% and industrial is at 28%.\nJade Rahmani: The advisory services margin improvement was notable. I was wondering how much you think reflected the increased capital market mix and how much do you think relates to some costs that perhaps are running below normalized levels such as marketing spend, TME, things of that nature?\nEmma Giamartino: I think it's a mix of both. We have some higher margin revenue coming on and then we do have some costs that are one-time in nature and we'll come back. But we think the majority of that margin is sustainable. \nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. \nAnthony Paolone: Thanks. I was just wondering if you could help on Trammell Crow and just the development business, if there's a way to put some sort of rule of thumb or guide first around, you build something for your clients, it gets monetized and you produce a dollar of profit, how much of that goes back on average to CBRE and then of that amount, how much goes into EBITDA after you pay your people?\nBob Sulentic: Yeah Tony, I'll talk about that. And it's very relevant to this structure we put in place by the way with Turner & Townsend. So, the Trammell Crow company model generally works the following way. When we generate earnings, there's two levels of compensation, commitment that go to our developers and those who manage our development business and that totals around 40% of the total profit that then gets -- the other 60% goes into our earnings. That's the way that works. So when you look at this Turner & Townsend model that we've now just executed on or we will close on later this year, very, very similar structure. One of the reasons we're so excited, Trammell Crow company has thrived subject to this structure. Within Turner & Townsend would thrive subject to the structure, very motivational to the professionals in the business, very aligning between the company and the professionals in the business. And you've seen the results, you've seen our profits now in Trammell Crow Company are over six times what they were pre-financial crisis when we bought that business.\nAnthony Paolone: So, just to make sure I understand it, so like for instance, if Trammell Crow built a building for $100 and sells it for $130 and you get this $30 of profit, let's say, your institutional partners they get the bulk of that, like what piece that do you think goes to CBRE, is it like 20% or\u2026?\nBob Sulentic: Well, it differs on -- some development deals we will do on balance sheet, not many, but some we will particularly if they have a user identified. And then we have various kinds of structures, but for the most part, if you look at the total project profit that comes out of a deal, maybe 30% of it comes to us sometimes more than that. And then we apply those splits that I just described between the company and the developers. \nAnthony Paolone: Got it, so that 30 then, the 40 goes to the people and 60 to the EBITDA?\nBob Sulentic: Yeah. Now, I will say this we do build the suits or we do fee deals, those are 100% company owned projects. There's no third-party capital associated with those typically. \nAnthony Paolone: I see. Okay, great. That's helpful to frame it with, given that you've laid out size of what's under construction of the pipeline, so that's real helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks everyone for being with us. And we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today, and I look forward to regularly engaging with you in my new capacity as CFO. With that, please turn to Slide 8. Advisory Services net revenue and segment operating profit set new second quarter records, rising 47% and 130% versus Q2 2020. Notably, they surpassed their previous Q2 2019 peaks by 3% and 18% respectively. While leasing revenue climbed 33% compared to the prior year, it was about 18% below Q2 2019 levels, mostly due to subdued America's office leasing. Overall, leasing revenue rose year-over-year by 26% in the Americas, 61% in EMEA, and 40% in APAC. Americas performance was about 28% below Q2 2019, while EMEA and APAC were about 21% and 14% above. We are encouraged to see recent improvements in Americas leasing, with July thus far up significantly compared to both 2020 and 2019.  As expected, property sales improved markedly, with revenue growing 152% from the prior year period. Americas, EMEA, APAC property sales revenue was 158%, 132%, and 151% respectively. All regions eclipsed our Q2 2019 level, with total property sales revenue about 27% above Q2 2019. The macroeconomic backdrop is supported by real estate investments and global capital migration continues to steadily improve. Rising property sales also help to catalyze strong growth in commercial mortgage originations, which climbed to 61%. We saw a particularly strong demand for acquisition and construction financing and recapitalization. Our loan servicing portfolio grew 20% versus the prior year and 3% sequentially to over 294 billion, partially driven by strong retention of loans, brokered and originated despite loan servicing revenue growth of over 15% compared to Q2 2020. Evaluating revenue accelerated over 37% as transaction related work picked up. Activity is particularly strong in the U.S. with evaluation revenue increase nearly 47%. Finally, property management net revenue increased over 6%. EMEA and APAC grew strongly while Americas lagged due to a previous decision to exit some low margin contracts.  Moving to Slide 9, Global Workplace Solutions continued its long record of resilient growth with net revenue rising 11%. This reflected strong growth in project management up 15% and facilities management up 10% driven by elevated local facilities management and data center assignments, as well as the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation. Segment operating profit rose over 33%, reflecting solid top line growth, disciplined cost management, the benefit of a mixed shift to higher margin work, and the impact of last year of transformation initiatives, which more than offset increased medical expenses. Even accounting for about 17 million of transitory COVID related expenses in last year Q2, segment operating profit growth was up 18%. Importantly, our new business pipeline continues to be strong and well diversified, with a high concentration of life sciences, logistics, and technology companies along with new data center activities.  Turning to Slide 10, our real estate investment segment generated over 152 million of segment operating profits surpassing its previous quarterly high by 38 million. Impressive development operating profit of nearly 120 million was fueled by a large office property sale that commanded strong valuations due to the high quality of the assets and tenant fees. Importantly, our pipeline and in process portfolio both set new highs this quarter, rising to $9.6 billion and $15.2 billion respectively. This growth was largely driven by fee based office and industrial work for blue chip occupier clients.  Investment management revenue grew 35% to 139 million fueled by a 29% increase in asset management fees, higher acquisition and disposition fees, carried interest, and favorable FX translation. Assets under management rose 18% versus the prior year to a new record of more than $129 billion. Stepping up the growth of this business has been a strategic focus, and we're pleased with our progress. The strong top line growth, coupled with careful expense management, drove operating profit growth of 38%. Lastly, Hana's operating loss narrowed sequentially to 9 million. We expect the further narrowing of this loss going forward as all Hana sites are now operated by Industrious. And all Hana sites except for four legacy units are now owned by Industrious. The future financial impact of our Industrious stake, which will be mark-to-market as the value changes will be reflected in advisory.  On Slide 11, we'll look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. We now expect full year advisory sales and leasing revenue on a combined basis will likely approach 2019 levels with sales likely to moderately exceed prior peak and leasing likely to be roughly 15% or so shy of peak. We anticipate year-over-year sales and leasing revenue growth rates will likely moderate as we move further into the second half of the year when year-over-year comparisons will be tougher than in Q2 when activity last year was at a virtual standstill. As noted previously, Q3 leasing is off to a strong start where we continue to monitor the potential Delta variant impact on transaction volume. We've learned over the past 15 months, that office leasing is highly correlated with companies returning to the office. Given this, as we have started to see some U.S. based companies modestly delay return to office space, we believe there is a potential for this to impact the strong recovery we've seen quarter-to-date.  Across the rest of our advisory business, we expect revenue to rise in the low double digit range versus the high single digit growth we anticipated previously. We also expect our more robust advisory revenue projections will flow through into incremental margin expansion relative to our previous expectations. Moving to GWS, we are modestly raising our expectations for segment operating profits while maintaining our revenue forecast in the high single digit range. Net revenue is expected to slightly exceed this range. We're benefiting from a shift in service mix and exemplary cost discipline. As a result, we expect GWS segment operating profit to grow at around a high teens rate this year, a slight improvement from our previous expectations. Our updated GWS expectations include some incremental operating expense investments in the second half, and do not include any benefit from our announced Turner & Townsend transaction.  Looking at REI, we expect this segment to nearly double 2020s record high profitability. In investment management we expect revenue to surpass [Technical Difficulty] and profit to rise at least at a high teens rate from the 140 million achieved in 2020. We project development operating profit to more than double versus 2020, and to roughly triple its 2019 contribution of 122 million. They are developing product in strong markets and sectors with supportive fundamentals and have a solid pipeline for asset monetization. This is expected to translate into Q3 operating profits that are likely to be at least as high as Q2. Given the robust pipeline and in process activity, we are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our long-term growth.  Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue should significantly exceed the level achieved in 2019 even though we expect a modest uptick in corporate expenses, as compared to that year. The return of high margin sales revenue, the effects of last year's transformation initiatives, and strong development gains are drivers of the improved outlook. Overall, we now project our 2021 adjusted EPS to surpass our 2019 pre-pandemic peaks of $3.71 to have wider margin than we expected at the end of the first quarter. As usual, we will realize more than half our earnings in the second half, but given our year-to-date performance, those earnings will be slightly more weighted to the first half than they have been in most years.  Moving to Slide 12, over the last year we've allocated about $2 billion in total, including about $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, investments in sponsorships and partnerships, and M&A inclusive of our pending Turner & Townsend transactions, while returning cash to shareholders by buying back approximately $88 million of shares. Still net leverage remains modest at 0.2 times pro forma for the expected closing payment of the Turner & Townsend transaction. We have a significant capacity to invest in growth and diversification using our four pronged investment approach, convincing of sponsorships, partnerships, acquisitions, and building our own resources and capabilities. Our strong balance sheet, coupled with the strategic moves we've made over the last year and market leading position give us great confidence that we can deliver compelling and scalable growth for years to come.  Looking ahead, we believe we are firmly on track to achieve the growth aspiration we outlined in February, at least low double digit average annual earnings growth through at least 2025, absent a downturn with a meaningful upside from incremental capital allocation. With that operator please open the line for questions. It's that the split will be a little bit more even. So the first half comp versus 2020 obviously is much easier than the second half. We are expecting a shift in our earnings to be more weighted, to move more towards the first half, so we still expect the majority of it to be in the second half. So office leasing revenue came down to 47% of our total leasing revenues globally and 2020 it was 54%. So it came down 7%. Yeah, so historically Turner & Townsend has shown very consistent mid-teens growth, both to net revenue and EBITDA. And through 2021, you probably saw their revenue was pretty flat. They only dropped 3% and EBITDA was up significantly. So going forward, we're expecting them to continue to hit those mid double digit revenue, mid-teens revenue and EBITDA but I will say that for 2022, we are expecting EBITDA to be in line with 2021 as costs come back in post COVID, even as revenue increases. No, we have done a few intel acquisitions for Industrious. We have not revalued that investment because it was the reason we expect to do that later that year. So you won't see any impact from Industrious this year. Yeah. So we still have a very strong M&A pipeline. I think we are going to look to do more deals like Turner & Townsend, we will also continue to do our programmatic M&A through in sell. But I think you'll see a mix of both and our real focus is on finding targets that can really help push our strategy forward, our diversification strategy across asset types, business lines, client types, and geographies that Bob has talked about with all of you many times. And so we're going to look for strategic M&A, we're not going to force it. If we can't find the right opportunities, we'll obviously look to return cash to shareholders. So on the -- I gave some of the stats on leasing before. We're at 47% office globally, 32% industrial. On the sales side office is down to 18% and industrial is at 28%. I think it's a mix of both. We have some higher margin revenue coming on and then we do have some costs that are one-time in nature and we'll come back. But we think the majority of that margin is sustainable."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thanks Kristyn and good morning everyone. As you've seen from the results Kristyn just summarized, CBRE continues to benefit from the multiyear efforts to diversify our business across four dimensions; asset type, business line, client type, and geography. We've moved decisively to capitalize on this opportunity and are making investments and driving organic growth initiatives that will continue this trend. Overall Q2 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew at better than 20% compounded rate from Q2 2019 with strong growth across all three business segments. Each segment experienced significant margin expansion over this two-year period due to our disciplined expense management along with the benefits of diversification. Thoughtful investments shaped by a well-developed strategy will play a central role as we continue to grow and diversify our business across asset type, business line, client type, and geography. Our balance sheet was very strong going into COVID and has strengthened further as we emerged from the pandemic. We are putting some of this balance sheet capacity to work with a particular focus on investing in secularly failed [ph] companies that enhance our ability to provide clients with customized solutions and will benefit from a relationship with CBRE. You saw this earlier this year when we acquired a 40% ownership interest in Industrious in the Flex space arena and again this month with our SPACs sponsorship of Altus Power in the commercial and industrial solar energy sector. On Tuesday, we announced a $1.3 billion purchase of a 60% stake in Turner & Townsend, a global leader in project, program, and cost management. This is a great brand and great management team operating in sectors with favorable long term growth profiles. Turner & Townsend will advance diversification across the four dimensions of our business that we've been discussing. For example, across asset types, Turner & Townsend brings us capabilities in infrastructure and green energy where they can help support our efforts to meet our client's carbon reduction goals. They are the global leader in cost consultancy, a line of business where we have a small practice now. Geographically, they move our project management business into new markets in Asia and the Middle East while we can help them grow in the Americas and elsewhere. And they add an array of new clients around the world, most notably in the government sector. We look forward to hitting the ground running with Turner & Townsend when the transaction closes later this year.  Before concluding, I'll briefly comment on the leadership changes we announced this morning. Over the past several years, we've evolved our senior leadership team dramatically, identifying our most compelling executives and putting them in roles where they can have the greatest impact on our business. The elevation of Emma Giamartino and Vikram Kohli, the Global Group President roles, represents another step in this direction. Consolidating our capital investment and finance functions under Emma reflects the growing importance of capital allocation to the long-term growth aspirations that we outlined at the end of last year. She has proven to be an accomplished investor of our capital who has an exceptional ability to work effectively with our leaders around the world to execute our capital strategy. Vikram has rapidly emerged as a leader with a unique ability to harness data and insight from across our business as well as from external sources. And like Emma, he has excelled at working across our global platform. Adding our strategy and digital and technology functions to his mandate will create a business intelligence capability that will better enable us to make powerful fact based decisions as we guide the company's growth. Vikram is the first senior executives from outside the U.S. to ascend to this level in the company. We expect to elevate other executives from outside the U.S. in the senior global leadership roles as we continue to put our best talent into key positions.  Leah Stearns will remain with us through year-end to ensure a smooth transition of financial leadership responsibilities. I want to thank Leah for her vision and initiating the transformation of our finance organization, managing finance through the worst of the COVID 19 crisis, and together with Kristyn taking our Investor Relations program to a new level, including articulating the financial framework for our long-term growth aspirations. We wish Leah continued success. With that I'll turn the call over to Emma. Tony, I would say it's both. Capital markets is doing quite well. There is a huge amount of capital interested in commercial real estate, obviously aimed at certain asset classes, for instance, anything related to industrial distribution, multifamily data centers. There is a lot of capital aimed at those assets, lot of trading going on and obviously we're big in those arenas. So it's coming through in our numbers. As it relates to leasing, it's what it has been. There's a real uncertainty about how and when companies will go back to the office post COVID and as long as that overhang is out there, decisions will be made more slowly than they have been historically. Now, as you've seen over the past few months with the vaccination, more people were back in the office, more decisions were being made, commitments were being made, but we're -- I would say we can be certain about two things, we probably won't go back to where we were pre-COVID, but we'll definitively go back to a level that's far beyond what it has been in the past 15 months, right. The decision-making process around office space has just been extremely muted and that's not going to sustain once we get to the other side of COVID. That business has not been cyclical. As Emma said, they'd been a steady double-digit grower on the top and bottom line for the last decade. The nature of the projects they work on, and one of the things Steve that was so attractive about them are really benefiting from secular tailwinds. So they're doing stuff in the green energy arena, in the infrastructure arena. They're doing very large complex projects for corporates that span several years. So, the decision making that underpins those contracts with corporates on about what's going on in the current cycle, they're about what their long-term needs are.

So they're very resilient and they are a high margin company and they are real grower. Oh yeah, big complex projects like that last for years and years. I'll give you another example, they're working on a $6 billion redevelopment at the Toronto airport. Any of us that have gone to airports and seen these projects know they just, they go on for a long time. So yes, those contracts are very long-term. Yeah Jade, there was some pent up demand that came through in the marketplace, but when you ask about capital markets in the real commercial real estate sector, you have to look at the alternative places capital can go. And as you know, there is a lot of capital around the world and prices are high in most asset classes, stocks, etcetera.

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kristyn Farahmand. Ms. Farahmand, you may begin.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone and welcome to CBRE\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks, as well as an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Our agenda for this morning\u2019s call will be as follows. First, I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the quarter. Next, Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO and Leah Stearns, our CFO, will discuss our quarterly results and updated 2021 qualitative outlook. After their comments, we'll open up the call for questions. Before I begin, I will remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE\u2019s future growth prospects, including 2021 qualitative outlook and multiyear growth framework, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, M&A and investment activity, financial performance, including profitability, expenses, margins, adjusted EPS in the effects of both cost savings initiatives in the COVID-19 pandemic and the integration and performance of acquisitions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q respectively. We have provided reconciliations of adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, net revenue, and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanation of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. Before we discuss the quarter, I'll briefly outline a few changes to our financial reporting, which are summarized in our earnings release as well. First, we now report all project management revenue in our GWS segment. Previously, a portion of our project management revenue was reported in the advisory segment. Next, all sales and leasing revenue is now reported in the advisory segment. We will no longer report sales and leasing revenue from GWS clients in the GWS segment. Including all sales and leasing revenue in the advisory segment had a more complete picture of transactional trends in our business. We have also established a fourth business segment where we will report corporate overhead expense and other financial impacts that are not specific to one of our three existing operational segment. This will provide greater transparency into our cost structure. Due to this change, we will utilizing segment operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our operating segments, which excludes the impact of corporate overhead. Additionally, we will replace our fee revenue metric with net revenue to account for the impact of pass-through reimbursement revenue. Net revenue will only excludes reimbursement revenue, that does not generate a margin for CBRE. We believe this will provide a clear view of our profitability profile, particularly in our GWS business. For this quarter, we have provided a bridge for legacy and revised financial metrics at our quarterly supplemental posted to the investor relations section of our website. Going forward, we will only be reporting these updated financial metrics. Now please turn to slide four, which highlights our first quarter 2021 results. Total revenue grew about 1% to a new first quarter record of over $5.9 billion, while net revenue fell 2% reflecting continued constraints transaction activity in advisory services. The quarter saw tangible benefit from both last year's transformation initiatives, which has improved our cost structure and operational agility and higher OMSR gains. In total, our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 200 basis points rising to 14.6% in line with our first quarter 2019 margin. Overall adjusted EPS grew 15% to $0.86, while GAAP EPS was 55% to $0.78. Importantly, GAAP EPS in the prior year first quarter included a $0.17 headwind from an asset impairment, which was in part related to the onset of the pandemic. The impairment was not included in adjusted EPS last year. Additionally, this quarter includes $0.11 benefit from venture fund investment gains and an accounting methodology change within our investment management business. Excluding unusual items in both periods, EPS was roughly flat with first quarter 2020 on an adjusted and GAAP basis. Now for deeper insights, please turn to slide six as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning everyone. CBRE is off to a strong start in 2021. Our performance is being propelled by our long standing efforts to diversify our business across four key dimensions; property types, lines of business, geographic markets, and client types. Last quarter, we described in detail how this diversification has enhanced the resiliency of our business. This played out in several ways during the first quarter. Geographically, while activity in some markets notably the Americas remained muted. We saw solid growth in the United Kingdom, parts of continental Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Greater China. Among business lines, mortgage origination and loan servicing, valuations, investment management, and facilities management flogged solid growth, offsetting a continued tepid sales and leasing environment. Industrial and data centers remain preferred property types. Our work in both property types grew robustly in the quarter fueled by booming demand for e-commerce and cloud-based services. Growth in these resilient property types helped to compensate for continued pressure on other property types, particularly office. Our client base is well diversified across the economy. In a quarter we won activity with clients and some industries was down from a year ago. We saw particular strength in our work for life sciences, and industrial and logistics companies, among others. The broad diversification of our business coupled with decisive actions in 2020 to reset our cost structure, underpinned our earnings growth for the quarter, and we expect to see continued benefits in the quarters and years ahead. For full year 2021, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to meaningfully surpass 2019 peak level with potential upside from discretionary capital deployment. Notably, our outlook for 2021 and beyond envision strong growth even with continued pressure on the office market. Clearly, that pressure remains very acute right now particularly in densely populated gateway cities, and will remain challenging for some time to come. However, we strongly believe the pressures on Office will recede from today's extreme levels, as vaccine rollouts continue, and companies settle into new normal work regimes. We expect our growth to be enhanced by capital deployment that is focused on sectors and business lines that are positioned to benefit significantly from secular growth trends. You saw evidence of this with our investment in industrious in the first quarter, which positions us to participate in the rising demand for flexible space solutions. And you can expect to see more evidence of it in future partnerships, sponsorships, and M&A activity. Now, Leah will tell you more about the quarter, our outlook and our capital deployment strategy. Leah?\nLeah Stearns: Thanks, Bob. Turning to slide eight, segment, operating profit for advisory services was nearly flat despite a 5% net revenue decline. The revenue shortfall reflects continued pressure in high margin sales and leasing businesses, which we offset with discipline cost management, strong GSE servicing activity and elevated OMSR gains, as well as growth in the other advisory lines of business. Overall, our advisory segment operating profit margin expanded about 100 basis points compared with a year ago. Excluding the OMSR gains in both years, the margin improved 20 basis points to about 17.2%. As expected, global leasing revenue remained under pressure declining 17% due primarily to weak office leasing in the Americas. We did see modest sequential improvement in America's office leasing, as revenue fell 47% versus the 58% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter. Activity were stronger and other geographies and property types. For example, APAC leasing rose a healthy 11% as retail and industrial jumped 25% and 38%, respectively, while office was flat with a year ago. EMEA leasing grew 4% reflecting surging industrial demand, which outweighed moderate office and retail declines. Notably, China and Australia, where the pandemic remains well in check, have seen office occupancy return to pre-COVID levels, which has coincided with improving leasing trends in these markets. Advisory sales continued to improve sequentially declining just 9% versus the 16% decline in the fourth quarter. This improvement was paid by APAC or sales get just 2%, reflecting particularly robust retail and industrial activity. Americas and EMEA sales fell around 10% and 13% respectively, due primarily to sharply lower office sales. Excluding the sales and leasing business lines, net revenue rose 7% and comprise nearly half of the advisory segments Total net revenue. commercial mortgage origination revenue rose nearly 14% in the quarter, reflecting strong GSE lending including for affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and a pickup in construction activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan origination, our loan servicing portfolio increased 19% to nearly $285 billion, while servicing revenue rose over 21%. Valuation revenue was up 8%, activity was particularly strong in the Pacific region where valuation revenue increased over 35%. And finally, property management net revenue grew over 2%, primarily driven by expanded and new client relationships in APAC. This offset a modest decline in the U.S. as we exited a low margin contract and transferred a few accounts to our local facilities management business in GWS. Moving to slide nine, global workplace solutions revenue and net revenue edged up 4% and 1% respectively, on a net revenue basis facilities management Rose 4%, while project management decreased 7%. The decline in project management was driven by the legacy advisory project management business. Project work for these clients tends to be tied to space that out resulting from new leases, and that should improve as leasing markets recover. Revenue associated with GWS contractual clients was at moderately in the quarter. Modest top line growth coupled with continued discipline in cost management and the benefit of transformation initiatives undertaken in 2020, lead to segment operating profit growth of 42%. As we mentioned last year, Q1 did include an $11 million drag from the reduced scope of a client account, adjusting for this unique item, segment operating profit was still up 29%. Importantly, we have seen a meaningful ramp in our facilities management new business pipeline, and it now exceeds the year end 2019 level. The acceleration since year end has been broad based and diversified across geographies, industry sectors, notably life sciences, manufacturing and logistics, professional services and technology clients and among property types, including data centers, retail, office and manufacturing facilities. Turning to slide 10. Our real estate investment segment generated $61 million of segment operating profit, an $18 million increase from Q1, 2020. Investment management revenue grew 9% to $132 million. This revenue growth was fueled by a 16% increase in asset management fees generated by a strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record level of over 124 billion, as well as stronger incentives and development fees, as well as co-investment gains. In addition, we recorded a $24 million benefit from an accounting change related to the valuation of unlisted assets, which should help reduce earnings volatility going forward. This partially offset lower carried interest which declined $14 million to about $5 million in the quarter. Operating profit for this business line rose to $69 million, an increase of over 200%. Development operating profit fell to $9 million. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of certain assets sales, which were particularly strong in the prior year first quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, development operating profit has grown about 36% are in process development portfolio reached a new record at $15 billion. Importantly, three asset types that remain in strong demand, multifamily, industrial and healthcare. Plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise more than 80% of this portfolio. Our development pipeline also grew 11% from year end to $6.8 billion. Lastly, Hana's higher operating loss primarily reflects certain deal costs and software write-downs associated with the industrious transaction. We remain on course to close the increase in our industrial stake from 35% to 40%, during the second quarter. Turning to slide 11. Let's now take a look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. Transaction activity is improving more quickly than we initially anticipated. This is especially true for global property sales and leasing outside the Americas. As a result, we have raised our outlook for 2021 transaction revenue growth to the low double digit range. Earlier we had expected growth in the mid to high single digits. We expect the rebound and transaction revenue to be most pronounced in the second quarter, since we will be comparing against the most depressed levels of the pandemic. Across the rest of our advisory businesses, we continue to expect high single digit growth. We expect improved profitability as well given the revival of transaction revenue. For 2021, we anticipate our advisory segment operating profit margin on net revenue will slightly surpass the 19.7% pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019. Moving to GWS. We are raising our expectations for segment operating profit, while maintaining our revenue forecasts in the high single digit range. We are benefiting from exceptional cost discipline, which we believe will allow us to reverse certain temporary expense cuts more slowly than originally anticipated. As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow in the mid to high teens range this year. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record profitability contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for sharply improved performance. In investment management, we expect revenue to slightly surpass 2020's $475 million, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect this business lines profitability, which totaled $140 million in 2020 to rise from that level at a mid to high teens pace. We project U.S. development profit to rise by more than 30% compared with last year's $150 million level. Our improved outlook reflects a strong pace of monetization and higher property valuations than we originally projected. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow with an emphasis on warehouse and distribution space. For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID restrictions lift and reiterate our earlier expectations for this business. Profitability is expected to be about $15 million higher than the $3 million generated in 2020. Due to our improved revenue outlook and the benefit of transformation initiatives completed last year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue to modestly exceed the 14% level achieved in 2019. This includes an expected uptick in corporate expenses, primarily related to higher performance based stock compensation and certain OpEx investments for growth initiatives. All in, as Bob indicated, we now expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to meaningfully surpass our pre-pandemic peak at $3.71, achieved in 2019, with potential upside from capital allocation activities. The anticipated growth for this year is likely to be significantly above the trend line, we provided in our long term aspirational outlook last quarter. Flipping to slide 12, we retained significant financial capacity to accelerate long term growth, while also returning cash to our shareholders. We believe that we have significantly reduced the volatility of our financial results and enhance free cash flow potential. The record free cash flow we generated in 2020 combined with the prudent way we manage our balance sheet ahead of the crisis, positions us to deploy capital as economic conditions improve. Our efforts have already begun. So far this year, we've invested about $200 million on capital expenditures, M&A, and partnership investments, while buying back approximately $88 million of shares, including $64 million in the first quarter. We have a strong M&A pipeline and expect to continue programmatic share repurchases. However, given our strong balance sheets and free cash flow generation, it is highly unlikely we will approach the high end of our target leverage range within our current long term planning period, absent a transformational investment. In closing, we are optimistic about our outlook for 2021 and beyond. We have a strong industry leadership position and management team. well diversified business, loyal client base and the capital structure to fund future growth and optimize shareholder return. And with that, operator, we'll take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: Thank you, and good morning. My first question is, I didn't catch all of Kristyn's opening comments. And I think there was some mention about flat EPS maybe year-over-year, because of some changes in the impact there. Can you touch on that again? I just want to make sure I understand the baseline and what changed?\nLeah Stearns: Sure. Anthony, it's Leah. Kristyn has just outline. There were some unique items in Q1 from last year, as well as this year. The key drivers are really an impairment that we had last year for GAAP EPS. And then, in the first quarter, we did have an accounting change in global investors related to our fair value accounting around our co-investment balances. We also had venture capital gains that was one time in nature in the first quarter this year. And so those items have basically offset each other.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Does the change in the valuation items in REI that you did in the first quarter. Does that change how we should think about the profits of that business just on a run rate basis? Like, does that add to the 2020, 2021 full year?\nLeah Stearns: It is. It was something that we expected. It was an anticipated accounting change when we came into the year that we were going to implement in Q1. And it is something that will actually reduce the volatility of that earnings stream within our investment management business going forward. We're basically going to be marketing to market our unlisted co-investment balances. And therefore, instead of having one large gain at the end of the period costs, you're going to see us mark that to market every quarter.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And so, is there a way to frame that for the full year 2021 at this point? Or you've got it fully marked as of the first quarter and it's just from here, you'll make changes?\nLeah Stearns: That's exactly right. From here, we'll make changes fully marked.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, understand. Then same question. Last year, you outlined a lot of different cost saves. And now you change some of the presentation here. Is there a way to put that into the framework, understand where you are on that right now? What was achieved in the first quarter? And what's left to see over the remainder of the year?\nLeah Stearns: Absolutely. I would say in terms of how we're presenting the information. There's not a real material shift in terms of where the benefits of the cost management actions are flowing through the business. The advisory segment continues to be the area where we've made the lion share of the overall cost reduction. So that's 60% of our cost actions are benefiting advisory. Next to that is GWS, where we've got about 30%. And then the rest is between REI and our corporate segments. In terms of this first quarter though, on a net basis, I'll talk a little bit about -- we have run rate cost savings. Now we do have some temporary costs coming back like compensation that's performance based, and accrued based on that. We had about $24 million of benefit and advisory on a net basis, and about $14 million of benefit in GWS with the rest, basically, about a million or so across REI and corporate. So again, the vast majority of the overall benefit in Q1 was an advisory and our reporting segment, modifications haven't really altered the mix of where that's going to impact the business going forward.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. So that's about $40 million that you achieved in the first quarter. What should we expect over the balance of the year?\nLeah Stearns: Yes. So in terms of for the full year, we think there will be a little over $110 million of savings. And this is all on a net basis. So when you close that up, we have taken out about just shy of $90 million in the first quarter and right around $250 million of incremental costs year-over-year on a runway basis.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. Okay. And then just moving more towards the business side of things. As you will get through the strength and life sciences, data centers, industrial that stuff, can the growth in those areas, longer term offset any diminution in office?\nLeah Stearns: We do expect that the diversification not just across asset types, but across our geographies will also be important. So as we think about just surging demand for warehouse, industrial distribution, life sciences, as well as digital infrastructure, those are certainly helping to mitigate the acute declines that we're seeing across office. So, I do think that that is a key part of the overall story for CBRE. And the fact that we have positioned ourselves to be aligned with those very important areas of demand in the market today. And then also, given the fact that APAC was early on in terms of the impacts related to COVID, we are seeing the regions of the world that has kind of come through this and manage through COVID quite well or effectively, or we're early on the onset of COVID. Those are really back in terms of strong performance. And we're starting to see the recovery take shape in places like the U.K., Continental Europe and U.S.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then lastly, can you just comment on the transaction environment for acquisitions, you've talked about it for several quarters, you made the industrious investment. Just wondering about the size and pipeline of potential deals over the balance of the year?\nBob Sulentic: Anthony, this is Bob. We have a substantial M&A pipeline and pipeline of alternatives or investment opportunities that we would characterize more as sponsorship type opportunities where we could invest in a company and then help that company be more successful and it would be on its own. We've done a lot of strategy work to determine the areas of our business that we want to make investments in because we think they will benefit in a secular way. Leah had just outlined a bunch of that for you. So you should expect to see us make some very nice investments over the coming months, that would be secondarily favored, and CBRE would be able to help those investments perform well. I will say that we're going to be very careful. We're not going to be feeling pressure to push money out the door just because we have it. We do think that there will be opportunities.\nAnthony Paolone: It sounds like less on the side of operating intensive things like traditional type transactions, more of sort of the industrial style deals?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Some of both, and also some incremental investment in our real estate investment business. We do a lot in the industrial area, for instance, and we think there's incremental opportunities to invest there.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. I was wondering if on a per share basis, there's any way to quantify what you might consider unusual items. Was it just the REI accounting change of perhaps around $0.05 per share or were there additional items?\nLeah Stearns: So Jade, in terms of the venture capital and the REI accounting change, those, as well as some prior period items, I would say, you got about $0.06 each related to the VC and the accounting change. And then we did have -- in the prior year period, we didn't have that impairment related to the COVID impacts across parts of our business. So that was reflected in the prior period.\nJade Rahmani: And just looking at the changes to definition of net revenue, would fee revenue growth have been similar around four -- down 4.4% on a local currency basis for the first quarter?\nLeah Stearns: We've provided a bridge for you in terms of the overall fee to net basis. It was pretty much in line. There wasn't a major swing there.\nJade Rahmani: Thanks. In terms of the GSE multifamily volumes, they've surged so far this year, up I believe over 50%. And I think you also pointed out the margin benefit from the MSR gain. Have you seen any slowdown in GSEs multifamily originations. Your rates were lower early in the year. And I think the mix of refi transactions was above the normal rate. So are you expecting the volume growth in that business to slow?\nLeah Stearns: Well, that's really driven, again, by market conditions. So if you look at our margin performance for the year, yes, OMSR certainly helps. But even if you back out OMSRs just before I get into the volumes on the GSEs, I think it's important to note that we actually saw margin expansion ex OMSRs. So that's really important. As it relates to the GSEs, their caps are coming down this year. So we may see some attenuation in terms of overall liquidity in that market. But again, their mandate is liquidity. So we'll see how they respond to the overall market conditions. The benefit to our business, though, is about the mix of where we're seeing that activity come from. And in the quarter, we did have more of a volume coming from Fannie as opposed to Freddie and that that certainly helps from a margin perspective, given the fact that we do have a risk share there on the Fannie side. So overall, it'll really depend, unfortunately, Jade with respect to how that that activity comes in, and we don't actually influence, that it's really a market driven outcome.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. Thanks very much. I've gotten some questions on the potential Biden administration changes on the 1031 exchange, and was wondering if you've looked at either what percentage of your transaction volume is in that marketplace could be impacted? And just overall, your thoughts around how that could impact the market?\nBob Sulentic: Jade, we have paid attention to that. And it is -- this is not the first time its arisen. So first of all, it's not certain that will happen. But we're watching it closely. I think we have to put in perspective, what part of our business that impacts so it impacts the sales businesses, the real estate asset sales business here in the U.S. And we think it impacts about 10% of the U.S. sales activity across markets, that's not a CBRE comment. So that's the portion of our business that might be impacted. Our view is that if it were to happen, and not be retroactive for the foreseeable future, it would be a plus for transaction volumes, because people would be in the market trying to get deals done. In the longer run, given the magnitude of it relative to our whole business and the area to which it's contained geographically and line of business wise, we think it will not have a material impact on our earnings prospects currently, or in the longer term as we've laid them out for you.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. And lastly, one of your peers that made an investment in a single family for rent platform. Wondering if you have any thoughts on the attractiveness of that sector and if it's something CBRE might pursue?\nBob Sulentic: We're always looking for new opportunities that are kind of within the boundaries of what we do. And again, keeping in mind, we think of our business in those four dimensions that we talked about property type, line of business, client type and geography, we're scanning the horizon constantly for new opportunities. And we don't talk in advance of when we execute those new opportunities, Jade, what we might do. That's not an area that we're active in, though.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Skidmore: Good morning. Bob, you mentioned in your prepared comments about the new normal work regime and in office, you talk about what you expect that new normal to be in office based on your clients conversations. And I believe and maybe a prior call, you talked about office being at 85% versus pre-pandemic. Can you just maybe update your view there? Thank you.\nBob Sulentic: Not a lot new to our view. We are intensely engaged with occupiers here in the U.S. and around the world. We believe that office will never be quite what it was prior to the pandemic. But we also believe it will be very different than it is today. The 85% that we talked about before is kind of still what we believe. By the way, if you're paying close attention to the press, and what individual companies are saying, most of the outlier comments coming in now have the flavor of, well, our people are really getting wary, and our people really need to get back together. And we really need to focus on culture. And we really need to focus on bringing new people on. So while our view hasn't changed, our conviction around the notion that it'll -- that people will get back to the office in a dramatically different way than they are today has probably grown. There will certainly be a hybrid scenario where there'll be some work from home, some work from flex space, and then of course, some work from offices. We think the configuration of offices will change, and that'll create some real opportunity for us to do work for our clients. But largely, our view is what it was 60 days ago when we reported our yearend earnings, Rick.\nRick Skidmore: Great, thanks. Thanks, Bob, for that. And just to follow up. Few of the office company, and one of the data providers has talked about traffic picking up on the office side in terms of just leasing insurance. Are you seeing that in your pipeline? Or is that -- and what would be driving that? Is that people looking for expansion space? Is it just tenants just rotating space and hydrating? Any comments there?\nBob Sulentic: We're certainly seeing the pickup in activity, and it's everything, it's people finally coming to grips with the fact that the vaccine is working here and these are U.S. comments. The vaccine is working. The disease is dissipating. And people are moving back toward more normal circumstances in many ways. And returning to the office is one of them. So it's pick up in every kind of thing you can imagine. And it's going to be different second half of the year than it is now.\nRick Skidmore: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Funk: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the questions. Just to follow on that last one. Thinking about return to work, most clients delaying or pushing out longer term leasing decisions until after employees return to work? Or based on your conversations do they already have a sense of what they're going to need in terms of office space and are they entering into new leases? Or do we expect it to be mostly renewals for the remainder of the year?\nBob Sulentic: It's a mixed bag, Michael. It depends. As some companies are aggressively out in the market, trying to execute plans now and others are waiting. And so, I wouldn't be able to characterize it as one thing across the board for these big occupiers we work with. I think the trend is more and more of them are deciding to have to address it. I will I will tell you one thing that we believe is going to happen. Better quality buildings with better infrastructure, better HVAC systems, better circulation around the building, better elevator systems, et cetera, are going to be in more demand as a result of this circumstance for very obvious reasons. And we think there is some chance that as we get later in the year and early next year, there could be real focus on those buildings and we'll pick up an activity.\nMichael Funk: Back to the tax question. I appreciate the comments in the 1031 exchanges. But are you seeing real time impact now from the sellers maybe accelerating the timeframe for their sales, just in anticipation of any kind of changes in tax laws. Is that affecting the sales activity?\nLeah Stearns: We certainly have seen that happen before, Michael. I would say, this year we are seeing activity around 1031 exchanges continue to be healthy. So it is a phenomenon that we have seen play out before. And even at the end of last year, when there was some speculation that there would be tax reform in 2021, we did see some transactions come through in the fourth quarter, and that sometimes drives some of the seasonality that we see in the fourth quarter. But it's just a small portion of that.\nMichael Funk: Yes. Thank you. Maybe one more if I could. Just thinking about M&A, are there specific regions of interest? You highlighted that geography diversification certainly helped? And is helping your results? Are there other regions of interest maybe where you feel that you don't have a large enough footprint or might want to get bigger that would help with that diversification?\nBob Sulentic: We have across our M&A strategy. product types, we're interested in, lines of business, we're interested in, geographies we're interested in more than others, for sure, on each of those dimensions. And I wouldn't spike out anything specific, Michael, just because of the confidential nature of M&A. But I think you can be confident that again, across each of those dimensions, we have favored things we would like to get done. But we're very, very open to opportunities that aren't necessarily in the more favored areas. But we do have things retargeting.\nMichael Funk: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Sheldon: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, what do you think is driving the stronger improvement in leasing and capital market trends outside of the U.S. than within the U.S.? Is that mostly due to the different progressions with the pandemic? Or are there some other notable factors to consider?\nLeah Stearns: I think it really, at least what we've seen so far, it really is driven by where economies or our restrictions around mobility has been lifted and have been reopened. So for example, in China and Australia we see office occupancy is pretty much back to pre COVID pre-pandemic levels. And those are certain markets where we are seeing return in terms of demand that is corresponding with that. So I think it really is driven by the ability for businesses to get back to normal, and for transactions to really play out. And obviously, in some of those markets we're lapping or seeing comparable financial results versus really the initial downtick for those areas as well. So we are seeing nice growth come back because of that.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. That's helpful. And then, Trammell Crow's expansion into Europe. I guess, what could that mean for the development business over the next few years? And how are you thinking more broadly about expanding into new countries and regions for both Trammell Crow and for Telford on the development side?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Steven, we have an extremely strong development brand and franchise. We have a lot of capital available to us from third parties that want to invest in that business. And we have a deep knowledge of where we think development opportunities will occur because of our advisory business and the feet on the street, so to speak around the world across product types. For the longest time, we were hesitant to expand outside the United States. But the success of that business grew so much in the last decade, the interest of our Capital Partners grew so much. We took the step with Telford a couple of years ago. We're extremely pleased with that. And because of that, and because of the relationships on the advisory side, and because of the demands of our Capital Partners, we decided to take this step with industrial development across Europe. And you should expect to see more of that kind of expansion over time, very thoughtful, very careful, but more of that over time. And we think we're -- it's one of those opportunities that we think we're really well positioned to take advantage of. It's an opportunity to expand our services capability.

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristyn, and good morning everyone. CBRE is off to a strong start in 2021. Our performance is being propelled by our long standing efforts to diversify our business across four key dimensions; property types, lines of business, geographic markets, and client types. Last quarter, we described in detail how this diversification has enhanced the resiliency of our business. This played out in several ways during the first quarter. Geographically, while activity in some markets notably the Americas remained muted. We saw solid growth in the United Kingdom, parts of continental Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Greater China. Among business lines, mortgage origination and loan servicing, valuations, investment management, and facilities management flogged solid growth, offsetting a continued tepid sales and leasing environment. Industrial and data centers remain preferred property types. Our work in both property types grew robustly in the quarter fueled by booming demand for e-commerce and cloud-based services. Growth in these resilient property types helped to compensate for continued pressure on other property types, particularly office. Our client base is well diversified across the economy. In a quarter we won activity with clients and some industries was down from a year ago. We saw particular strength in our work for life sciences, and industrial and logistics companies, among others. The broad diversification of our business coupled with decisive actions in 2020 to reset our cost structure, underpinned our earnings growth for the quarter, and we expect to see continued benefits in the quarters and years ahead. For full year 2021, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to meaningfully surpass 2019 peak level with potential upside from discretionary capital deployment. Notably, our outlook for 2021 and beyond envision strong growth even with continued pressure on the office market. Clearly, that pressure remains very acute right now particularly in densely populated gateway cities, and will remain challenging for some time to come. However, we strongly believe the pressures on Office will recede from today's extreme levels, as vaccine rollouts continue, and companies settle into new normal work regimes. We expect our growth to be enhanced by capital deployment that is focused on sectors and business lines that are positioned to benefit significantly from secular growth trends. You saw evidence of this with our investment in industrious in the first quarter, which positions us to participate in the rising demand for flexible space solutions. And you can expect to see more evidence of it in future partnerships, sponsorships, and M&A activity. Now, Leah will tell you more about the quarter, our outlook and our capital deployment strategy. Leah? Anthony, this is Bob. We have a substantial M&A pipeline and pipeline of alternatives or investment opportunities that we would characterize more as sponsorship type opportunities where we could invest in a company and then help that company be more successful and it would be on its own. We've done a lot of strategy work to determine the areas of our business that we want to make investments in because we think they will benefit in a secular way. Leah had just outlined a bunch of that for you. So you should expect to see us make some very nice investments over the coming months, that would be secondarily favored, and CBRE would be able to help those investments perform well. I will say that we're going to be very careful. We're not going to be feeling pressure to push money out the door just because we have it. We do think that there will be opportunities. Yes. Some of both, and also some incremental investment in our real estate investment business. We do a lot in the industrial area, for instance, and we think there's incremental opportunities to invest there. Jade, we have paid attention to that. And it is -- this is not the first time its arisen. So first of all, it's not certain that will happen. But we're watching it closely. I think we have to put in perspective, what part of our business that impacts so it impacts the sales businesses, the real estate asset sales business here in the U.S. And we think it impacts about 10% of the U.S. sales activity across markets, that's not a CBRE comment. So that's the portion of our business that might be impacted. Our view is that if it were to happen, and not be retroactive for the foreseeable future, it would be a plus for transaction volumes, because people would be in the market trying to get deals done. In the longer run, given the magnitude of it relative to our whole business and the area to which it's contained geographically and line of business wise, we think it will not have a material impact on our earnings prospects currently, or in the longer term as we've laid them out for you. We're always looking for new opportunities that are kind of within the boundaries of what we do. And again, keeping in mind, we think of our business in those four dimensions that we talked about property type, line of business, client type and geography, we're scanning the horizon constantly for new opportunities. And we don't talk in advance of when we execute those new opportunities, Jade, what we might do. That's not an area that we're active in, though. Not a lot new to our view. We are intensely engaged with occupiers here in the U.S. and around the world. We believe that office will never be quite what it was prior to the pandemic. But we also believe it will be very different than it is today. The 85% that we talked about before is kind of still what we believe. By the way, if you're paying close attention to the press, and what individual companies are saying, most of the outlier comments coming in now have the flavor of, well, our people are really getting wary, and our people really need to get back together. And we really need to focus on culture. And we really need to focus on bringing new people on. So while our view hasn't changed, our conviction around the notion that it'll -- that people will get back to the office in a dramatically different way than they are today has probably grown. There will certainly be a hybrid scenario where there'll be some work from home, some work from flex space, and then of course, some work from offices. We think the configuration of offices will change, and that'll create some real opportunity for us to do work for our clients. But largely, our view is what it was 60 days ago when we reported our yearend earnings, Rick. We're certainly seeing the pickup in activity, and it's everything, it's people finally coming to grips with the fact that the vaccine is working here and these are U.S. comments. The vaccine is working. The disease is dissipating. And people are moving back toward more normal circumstances in many ways. And returning to the office is one of them. So it's pick up in every kind of thing you can imagine. And it's going to be different second half of the year than it is now. It's a mixed bag, Michael. It depends. As some companies are aggressively out in the market, trying to execute plans now and others are waiting. And so, I wouldn't be able to characterize it as one thing across the board for these big occupiers we work with. I think the trend is more and more of them are deciding to have to address it. I will I will tell you one thing that we believe is going to happen. Better quality buildings with better infrastructure, better HVAC systems, better circulation around the building, better elevator systems, et cetera, are going to be in more demand as a result of this circumstance for very obvious reasons. And we think there is some chance that as we get later in the year and early next year, there could be real focus on those buildings and we'll pick up an activity. We have across our M&A strategy. product types, we're interested in, lines of business, we're interested in, geographies we're interested in more than others, for sure, on each of those dimensions. And I wouldn't spike out anything specific, Michael, just because of the confidential nature of M&A. But I think you can be confident that again, across each of those dimensions, we have favored things we would like to get done. But we're very, very open to opportunities that aren't necessarily in the more favored areas. But we do have things retargeting. Yes. Steven, we have an extremely strong development brand and franchise. We have a lot of capital available to us from third parties that want to invest in that business. And we have a deep knowledge of where we think development opportunities will occur because of our advisory business and the feet on the street, so to speak around the world across product types. For the longest time, we were hesitant to expand outside the United States. But the success of that business grew so much in the last decade, the interest of our Capital Partners grew so much. We took the step with Telford a couple of years ago. We're extremely pleased with that. And because of that, and because of the relationships on the advisory side, and because of the demands of our Capital Partners, we decided to take this step with industrial development across Europe. And you should expect to see more of that kind of expansion over time, very thoughtful, very careful, but more of that over time. And we think we're -- it's one of those opportunities that we think we're really well positioned to take advantage of. It's an opportunity to expand our services capability. It's an opportunity to expand the footprint of things that we might invest capital into as well. Thanks everyone for being with us. And we'll talk to you again at the end of the second quarter."

            "name": "Leah Stearns",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Turning to slide eight, segment, operating profit for advisory services was nearly flat despite a 5% net revenue decline. The revenue shortfall reflects continued pressure in high margin sales and leasing businesses, which we offset with discipline cost management, strong GSE servicing activity and elevated OMSR gains, as well as growth in the other advisory lines of business. Overall, our advisory segment operating profit margin expanded about 100 basis points compared with a year ago. Excluding the OMSR gains in both years, the margin improved 20 basis points to about 17.2%. As expected, global leasing revenue remained under pressure declining 17% due primarily to weak office leasing in the Americas. We did see modest sequential improvement in America's office leasing, as revenue fell 47% versus the 58% decline we experienced in the fourth quarter. Activity were stronger and other geographies and property types. For example, APAC leasing rose a healthy 11% as retail and industrial jumped 25% and 38%, respectively, while office was flat with a year ago. EMEA leasing grew 4% reflecting surging industrial demand, which outweighed moderate office and retail declines. Notably, China and Australia, where the pandemic remains well in check, have seen office occupancy return to pre-COVID levels, which has coincided with improving leasing trends in these markets. Advisory sales continued to improve sequentially declining just 9% versus the 16% decline in the fourth quarter. This improvement was paid by APAC or sales get just 2%, reflecting particularly robust retail and industrial activity. Americas and EMEA sales fell around 10% and 13% respectively, due primarily to sharply lower office sales. Excluding the sales and leasing business lines, net revenue rose 7% and comprise nearly half of the advisory segments Total net revenue. commercial mortgage origination revenue rose nearly 14% in the quarter, reflecting strong GSE lending including for affordable housing. This activity also reflects the benefit of continued strong refinancing and a pickup in construction activity. As a result of the strong pace of loan origination, our loan servicing portfolio increased 19% to nearly $285 billion, while servicing revenue rose over 21%. Valuation revenue was up 8%, activity was particularly strong in the Pacific region where valuation revenue increased over 35%. And finally, property management net revenue grew over 2%, primarily driven by expanded and new client relationships in APAC. This offset a modest decline in the U.S. as we exited a low margin contract and transferred a few accounts to our local facilities management business in GWS. Moving to slide nine, global workplace solutions revenue and net revenue edged up 4% and 1% respectively, on a net revenue basis facilities management Rose 4%, while project management decreased 7%. The decline in project management was driven by the legacy advisory project management business. Project work for these clients tends to be tied to space that out resulting from new leases, and that should improve as leasing markets recover. Revenue associated with GWS contractual clients was at moderately in the quarter. Modest top line growth coupled with continued discipline in cost management and the benefit of transformation initiatives undertaken in 2020, lead to segment operating profit growth of 42%. As we mentioned last year, Q1 did include an $11 million drag from the reduced scope of a client account, adjusting for this unique item, segment operating profit was still up 29%. Importantly, we have seen a meaningful ramp in our facilities management new business pipeline, and it now exceeds the year end 2019 level. The acceleration since year end has been broad based and diversified across geographies, industry sectors, notably life sciences, manufacturing and logistics, professional services and technology clients and among property types, including data centers, retail, office and manufacturing facilities. Turning to slide 10. Our real estate investment segment generated $61 million of segment operating profit, an $18 million increase from Q1, 2020. Investment management revenue grew 9% to $132 million. This revenue growth was fueled by a 16% increase in asset management fees generated by a strong growth in assets under management, which reached a new record level of over 124 billion, as well as stronger incentives and development fees, as well as co-investment gains. In addition, we recorded a $24 million benefit from an accounting change related to the valuation of unlisted assets, which should help reduce earnings volatility going forward. This partially offset lower carried interest which declined $14 million to about $5 million in the quarter. Operating profit for this business line rose to $69 million, an increase of over 200%. Development operating profit fell to $9 million. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of certain assets sales, which were particularly strong in the prior year first quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, development operating profit has grown about 36% are in process development portfolio reached a new record at $15 billion. Importantly, three asset types that remain in strong demand, multifamily, industrial and healthcare. Plus office buildings that are at least 90% leased, comprise more than 80% of this portfolio. Our development pipeline also grew 11% from year end to $6.8 billion. Lastly, Hana's higher operating loss primarily reflects certain deal costs and software write-downs associated with the industrious transaction. We remain on course to close the increase in our industrial stake from 35% to 40%, during the second quarter. Turning to slide 11. Let's now take a look at our new qualitative outlook for the year. Transaction activity is improving more quickly than we initially anticipated. This is especially true for global property sales and leasing outside the Americas. As a result, we have raised our outlook for 2021 transaction revenue growth to the low double digit range. Earlier we had expected growth in the mid to high single digits. We expect the rebound and transaction revenue to be most pronounced in the second quarter, since we will be comparing against the most depressed levels of the pandemic. Across the rest of our advisory businesses, we continue to expect high single digit growth. We expect improved profitability as well given the revival of transaction revenue. For 2021, we anticipate our advisory segment operating profit margin on net revenue will slightly surpass the 19.7% pre-pandemic peak achieved in 2019. Moving to GWS. We are raising our expectations for segment operating profit, while maintaining our revenue forecasts in the high single digit range. We are benefiting from exceptional cost discipline, which we believe will allow us to reverse certain temporary expense cuts more slowly than originally anticipated. As a result, we now expect GWS segment operating profit to grow in the mid to high teens range this year. Looking at REI, we expect this segment to build on its record profitability contribution in 2020, with both investment management and development poised for sharply improved performance. In investment management, we expect revenue to slightly surpass 2020's $475 million, with continued increases in recurring revenue being offset by lower carried interest. We expect this business lines profitability, which totaled $140 million in 2020 to rise from that level at a mid to high teens pace. We project U.S. development profit to rise by more than 30% compared with last year's $150 million level. Our improved outlook reflects a strong pace of monetization and higher property valuations than we originally projected. Our in-process portfolio continues to grow with an emphasis on warehouse and distribution space. For our U.K. multifamily development business, we expect the pace of construction to pick up as COVID restrictions lift and reiterate our earlier expectations for this business. Profitability is expected to be about $15 million higher than the $3 million generated in 2020. Due to our improved revenue outlook and the benefit of transformation initiatives completed last year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue to modestly exceed the 14% level achieved in 2019. This includes an expected uptick in corporate expenses, primarily related to higher performance based stock compensation and certain OpEx investments for growth initiatives. All in, as Bob indicated, we now expect our 2021 adjusted EPS to meaningfully surpass our pre-pandemic peak at $3.71, achieved in 2019, with potential upside from capital allocation activities. The anticipated growth for this year is likely to be significantly above the trend line, we provided in our long term aspirational outlook last quarter. Flipping to slide 12, we retained significant financial capacity to accelerate long term growth, while also returning cash to our shareholders. We believe that we have significantly reduced the volatility of our financial results and enhance free cash flow potential. The record free cash flow we generated in 2020 combined with the prudent way we manage our balance sheet ahead of the crisis, positions us to deploy capital as economic conditions improve. Our efforts have already begun. So far this year, we've invested about $200 million on capital expenditures, M&A, and partnership investments, while buying back approximately $88 million of shares, including $64 million in the first quarter. We have a strong M&A pipeline and expect to continue programmatic share repurchases. However, given our strong balance sheets and free cash flow generation, it is highly unlikely we will approach the high end of our target leverage range within our current long term planning period, absent a transformational investment. In closing, we are optimistic about our outlook for 2021 and beyond. We have a strong industry leadership position and management team. well diversified business, loyal client base and the capital structure to fund future growth and optimize shareholder return. And with that, operator, we'll take questions. Sure. Anthony, it's Leah. Kristyn has just outline. There were some unique items in Q1 from last year, as well as this year. The key drivers are really an impairment that we had last year for GAAP EPS. And then, in the first quarter, we did have an accounting change in global investors related to our fair value accounting around our co-investment balances. We also had venture capital gains that was one time in nature in the first quarter this year. And so those items have basically offset each other. It is. It was something that we expected. It was an anticipated accounting change when we came into the year that we were going to implement in Q1. And it is something that will actually reduce the volatility of that earnings stream within our investment management business going forward. We're basically going to be marketing to market our unlisted co-investment balances. And therefore, instead of having one large gain at the end of the period costs, you're going to see us mark that to market every quarter. That's exactly right. From here, we'll make changes fully marked. Absolutely. I would say in terms of how we're presenting the information. There's not a real material shift in terms of where the benefits of the cost management actions are flowing through the business. The advisory segment continues to be the area where we've made the lion share of the overall cost reduction. So that's 60% of our cost actions are benefiting advisory. Next to that is GWS, where we've got about 30%. And then the rest is between REI and our corporate segments. In terms of this first quarter though, on a net basis, I'll talk a little bit about -- we have run rate cost savings. Now we do have some temporary costs coming back like compensation that's performance based, and accrued based on that. We had about $24 million of benefit and advisory on a net basis, and about $14 million of benefit in GWS with the rest, basically, about a million or so across REI and corporate. So again, the vast majority of the overall benefit in Q1 was an advisory and our reporting segment, modifications haven't really altered the mix of where that's going to impact the business going forward. Yes. So in terms of for the full year, we think there will be a little over $110 million of savings. And this is all on a net basis. So when you close that up, we have taken out about just shy of $90 million in the first quarter and right around $250 million of incremental costs year-over-year on a runway basis. We do expect that the diversification not just across asset types, but across our geographies will also be important. So as we think about just surging demand for warehouse, industrial distribution, life sciences, as well as digital infrastructure, those are certainly helping to mitigate the acute declines that we're seeing across office. So, I do think that that is a key part of the overall story for CBRE. And the fact that we have positioned ourselves to be aligned with those very important areas of demand in the market today. And then also, given the fact that APAC was early on in terms of the impacts related to COVID, we are seeing the regions of the world that has kind of come through this and manage through COVID quite well or effectively, or we're early on the onset of COVID. Those are really back in terms of strong performance. And we're starting to see the recovery take shape in places like the U.K., Continental Europe and U.S. So Jade, in terms of the venture capital and the REI accounting change, those, as well as some prior period items, I would say, you got about $0.06 each related to the VC and the accounting change. And then we did have -- in the prior year period, we didn't have that impairment related to the COVID impacts across parts of our business. So that was reflected in the prior period. We've provided a bridge for you in terms of the overall fee to net basis. It was pretty much in line. There wasn't a major swing there. Well, that's really driven, again, by market conditions. So if you look at our margin performance for the year, yes, OMSR certainly helps. But even if you back out OMSRs just before I get into the volumes on the GSEs, I think it's important to note that we actually saw margin expansion ex OMSRs. So that's really important. As it relates to the GSEs, their caps are coming down this year. So we may see some attenuation in terms of overall liquidity in that market. But again, their mandate is liquidity. So we'll see how they respond to the overall market conditions. The benefit to our business, though, is about the mix of where we're seeing that activity come from. And in the quarter, we did have more of a volume coming from Fannie as opposed to Freddie and that that certainly helps from a margin perspective, given the fact that we do have a risk share there on the Fannie side. So overall, it'll really depend, unfortunately, Jade with respect to how that that activity comes in, and we don't actually influence, that it's really a market driven outcome. We certainly have seen that happen before, Michael. I would say, this year we are seeing activity around 1031 exchanges continue to be healthy. So it is a phenomenon that we have seen play out before. And even at the end of last year, when there was some speculation that there would be tax reform in 2021, we did see some transactions come through in the fourth quarter, and that sometimes drives some of the seasonality that we see in the fourth quarter. But it's just a small portion of that. I think it really, at least what we've seen so far, it really is driven by where economies or our restrictions around mobility has been lifted and have been reopened. So for example, in China and Australia we see office occupancy is pretty much back to pre COVID pre-pandemic levels. And those are certain markets where we are seeing return in terms of demand that is corresponding with that. So I think it really is driven by the ability for businesses to get back to normal, and for transactions to really play out. And obviously, in some of those markets we're lapping or seeing comparable financial results versus really the initial downtick for those areas as well. So we are seeing nice growth come back because of that."

A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require Operator assistance during the conference, please press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Burke, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance at CBRE. Thank you, you may begin.\nBrad Burke: Good morning everyone and welcome to CBRE\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks, and an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  Before we kick off today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll remind you that today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements concerning our earnings outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our SEC filings. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. I\u2019m joined on today\u2019s call by Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO, and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you Brad, and good morning everyone. As you\u2019ve seen, we reported core EPS of $1.33 for the fourth quarter. While down significantly from a year ago, core earnings were slightly above the estimate we provided at the end of the third quarter. This outcome was driven by several of the more cyclically resilient elements of our business, like outsourcing and others that are secularly favored, like project management and the logistics asset class. These businesses, which together comprise about 45% of our core EBITDA, grew revenue more than we expected, offset by a slightly larger than expected decline in transactional revenue. Full year core EPS grew 7% to $5.69. This is a solid growth rate considering the more than doubling of long term interest rates, sharp equity market decline, and the credit crunch that constrained investment activity for most of the second half. Notably, we ended 2022 with virtually no leverage despite making share repurchases, infill M&A, and strategic investments that together totaled approximately $2.1 billion during the year. Looking at the macro environment, cap rates are up 100 to 150 basis points, perhaps a bit more for office, and we expect them to expand another 25 basis points or so before peaking, likely in Q2. While capital largely remains on the sidelines, we are beginning to see signs of asset re-pricing helped along by the narrowing of spreads. Among property types, multi-family and industrial fundamentals should remain strong, albeit with occupancy declining slightly from peak levels and rent growth continuing at a more modest clip than the double-digit pace set in 2022. Office will remain the most challenged property type as we do not expect occupancy to come close to pre-pandemic levels in the short term. Globally, we expect significant sales and leasing weakness in the first half before adverse conditions begin to ease later in 2023. Relative to 2022, we expect both Europe and Asia Pacific to outperform the Americas this year. For 2023, we expect core EPS to decline by low to mid double digits but still to be the third highest in CBRE\u2019s history. As we\u2019ve pointed out before, this would be a meaningfully better performance than in prior recessions, such as the global financial crisis when core EPS decreased more than 60%. In all, 2023 will be a transition year and we feel good about where we\u2019ll be when we get to the other side of the downturn. While the macro environment can certainly change, we expect core EPS to grow strongly in 2024, exceeding the 2022 peak and reaching a record level in just the first year after a recession. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call to Emma, who will discuss our quarter and our outlook in greater detail. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thank you Bob. Before turning to our 2023 outlook, I\u2019ll first discuss fourth quarter results for each of our segments, starting with advisory on Slide 6. Advisory net revenue and SOPs declined by 21% and 33% respectively, driven by a slightly more pronounced decline in our higher margin transactional businesses than originally expected which was partially offset by healthy growth from our property management business. For capital markets, sales and mortgage origination combined revenue declined by 46%, in line with our expectations. Capital markets revenue growth was robust in last year\u2019s Q4, increasing by 53%, which accentuated the extent of this year\u2019s decline. Leasing revenue was down 7% both globally and in the Americas, a slightly bigger decline than we expected with a notable slowdown in office activity in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle. In total, global office leasing revenue was 14% below prior year after increasing by nearly 50% year to date through the third quarter, albeit against relatively easy prior year comparisons. Outside the U.S., leasing revenue was down 6% wholly due to FX translation headwinds. In local currency, lease revenue increased in both EMEA and Asia Pacific.  The 19% decline in loan servicing was attributable to fewer prepayments amid rising mortgage rates versus record prepayments in Q4 2021. Excluding prepayments, loan servicing revenue increased by 2%. Overall cost in advisory declined by 18%, but this was not enough to offset the 21% decrease in total new revenue. Turning to Slide 7, GWS net revenue grew by 13% with half of that increase coming from organic revenue growth. In local currency, net revenue excluding Turner & Townsend increased by 12% with facilities management up 9% and project management up 21%. GWS SOP increased by 30% with margin improvement driven partly by business mix.  Turner & Townsend continued to grow impressively. In the first full year since acquiring a 60% interest, Turner & Townsend has exceeded our original underwriting. 2022 represented our highest ever year for client contracts coming up for renewal, totaling over $4 billion. GWS renewed 94% of this total, often with increased scope of our client relationships. Looking forward, we expect 2023 renewals to be just over half the level of 2022. The GWS revenue pipeline ended the year up 11% over year-end 2021, reflecting continued demand from first generation and outsourcing clients as well as expansion mandates from our existing client base.  Turning to Slide 8, REI SOP declined to just $17 million in Q4 against an unusually strong prior year comparison. Our global development business posted a $6 million SOP loss primarily due to a $43 million loss in our Telford, U.K. development business. Lower SOP in U.S. development reflects the timing of assets dispositions, which were heavily weighted to this year\u2019s first half, consistent with our expectations going into the year. Following an in-depth review of the Telford business, we wrote down a handful of projects where we expect costs to exceed our initial underwriting, and we also increased our fire safety reserve. We now believe Telford financial performance will improve going forward. Investment management AUM grew $5 billion sequentially, driven by net capital inflows of $4 billion and positive FX movements which offset $5 billion of mark-to-market declines. Investment management SOPs declined due in part to co-investment losses versus a gain in the prior year quarter. Excluding co-investment gains and losses, investment management SOP was nearly flat with the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 9, our 2023 outlook is underpinned by the following macroeconomic assumptions. The U.S. will experience a short, moderate recession in 2023, unemployment will increase to near 5%, inflation will end the year above the Fed\u2019s 2% target but clearly trending down, and 10-year U.S. treasury yields will end the year under 3.5%. Should the economic outlook change from this base case, our business outlook would also change. In our advisory segment, we expect a mid single digit revenue decline. This will be driven by growth in more resilient lines of business offset by a mid to high single digit decline in leasing and mid-teens decline in property sales. We expect SOP to decline by high single digits to low double digits as cost savings initiatives partially offset both relatively better growth in lower margin businesses and general cost inflation. In our property sales business, we expect the number of transactions will be subdued in the first half of the year and accelerate in the back half of the year. We expect our leasing business to continue to benefit from an elevated level of lease expirations. While the return to office has been slow in the U.S., EMEA and APAC have seen occupancy return at a faster pace. As a result, we expect these regions to be less pressed than the Americas in 2023. For property management and valuations, we expect accelerating revenue growth in both kinds of business due to recent investments in sales support and tuck-in acquisitions, as well as less FX pressure. Within GWS, we expect low double digit new revenue and SOP growth with margins increasing slightly as cost savings more than offset inflation and incremental investment to support growth.  Our facilities management business is benefiting from new wins and expansions. All major client sectors are expected to grow, notably in healthcare and technology where the changing use of real estate is driving increased demand for outsourcing services that we believe CBRE is best positioned to deliver. We also expect continued momentum in our project management businesses, including double digit top and bottom line growth from our Turner & Townsend business. Within our REI segment, we expect SOP in the mid $300 million range with roughly equal contributions from development and investment management. Within our TCC development business, we expect SOP of just over 1% of our nearly $17 billion in-process portfolio, and we\u2019ve closed over $100 million of expected SOP in January alone. Our TCC business has developed a portfolio of assets that we believe is extremely well positioned for the current market environment with approximately 75% of our expected SOP in 2023 from industrial deals. While our Telford business remains challenged, we do expect improvement versus 2022 as significant cost inflation is now incorporated into projected results, adding approximately $20 million to SOP versus 2022.  Beyond our three main business segments, we also expect roughly flat corporate overhead and our full year core tax rate to rise to 2021 levels versus a lower 2022 rate. Consistent with our approach last year, the 2023 outlook assumes only a modest use of capital. That said, we continue to have a strong appetite for M&A and share repurchase, both of which could support incremental earnings growth above our current outlook, and we do not anticipate ending 2023 in a net cash position. In summary, we expect core EBITDA to decline by high single digits versus 2022 with over half attributable to the decline in development SOP. We expect core EPS to decline by low to mid double digits versus 2022. This is more than the core EBITDA decline because of higher depreciation and amortization and a higher tax rate than in 2022, when we had a number of one-time benefits that will not recur. Lastly, we expect nearly two-thirds of full year core EPS in the back half of the year, a more pronounced seasonality to earnings than we historically experienced.  The $400 million cost containment program we announced last quarter is embedded in our guidance. Fourth quarter results saw a nearly $80 million cost benefit and we expect a cost benefit in 2023 of approximately $300 million, with the remainder in 2024. The entirety of the cost containment program will be reflected in our run rate by the end of this year. We expect that our cost containment efforts will allow us to counteract the general inflation pressures and enable us to make continued investments to support future growth. Last year, we refreshed our 2025 financial guidance which implied CBRE would achieve core EPS between $8 and $9 by year-end 2025, absent meaningful capital allocation. Due to the real estate transaction downturn, our target is now likely to slip by 12 to 18 months. As I noted previously, our 2025 targets were established on the basis that there would not be a recession following the COVID recovery. The drivers of how we achieve this core EPS growth are largely unchanged. At the midpoint of that core EPS target, $8.50, CBRE will have achieved double digit compound core EPS growth since 2019 despite needing to manage through two significant downturns. It also represents a high teens CAGR from our 2023 projection. In closing, we remain excited about CBRE\u2019s prospects for long term growth, the strength of our brand, and our ability to outperform during periods of market weakness.  With that, Operator, we\u2019ll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from the line of Anthony Paolone with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Thank you and good morning. My first question relates to GWS and the outsourcing business, and I was wondering if you can maybe take us inside that business a bit more and help us understand how in an environment where office usage is down and footprints are shrinking, that that business can continue to grow. Just would like to better understand what additional services clients are taking on to maybe offset smaller footprints.\nBob Sulentic: Tony, first of all, even if the work you do for a client in a specific portion of their portfolio is shrinking, it likely would result in project management work, potentially transaction management work, portfolio management work, so even if you have some shrinkage within an account, there are opportunities for revenue. But secondly, there is the addition of new accounts which has been very significant for us for the past year, actually record levels, and we\u2019re expecting that going forward, where people are giving us more property to manage because they want to save cost, so the combination of those factors has allowed us to grow that business consistently over the years during downturns, and we expect it\u2019s going to be a double-digit grower in 2023 for the same reasons.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, and then just my second question relates to just perhaps any color you can give us that you\u2019re seeing on the ground today in terms of either greenshoots or regions or property types where you\u2019re starting to see activity levels rebound. I think you alluded to some properties starting to come to market or folks maybe testing the market a bit, and so just wonder if you could elaborate on that some.\nBob Sulentic: Yes, and you\u2019re asking with regard to property sales?\nAnthony Paolone: And leasing, just the more transactional stuff.\nBob Sulentic: Yes, okay. Well, where we\u2019re seeing activity in sales is for good assets, even in some cases office assets if they\u2019re Class A buildings, fully leased, but for sure industrial and multi-family. If you went back to last year, even the end of last year, you would get a couple bidders that would test the waters, but now for some of the better quality assets, we\u2019re getting several bidders and they\u2019re bidding aggressively, and there\u2019s anecdotes on multi-family, there\u2019s anecdotes on industrial in particular where we\u2019re seeing that happen. It\u2019s quite a bit different than it was last year. There is a lot of capital that\u2019s been on the sidelines wanting to acquire assets. There\u2019s a lot of asset owners that have wanted to sell assets, and we\u2019re starting to see spreads come in a little bit now and the buyers get a little more aggressive in various cases, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there. With leasing, we continue to see very strong fundamentals in industrial. There is low vacancy, there are a lot of companies out there that still need space for a variety of reasons, and so we are seeing momentum there, and then you have, as we said before, you have a considerable amount of renewal activity around office buildings and retail in particular. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Bob, you talked about 2024 EPS recovering to 2022 levels at least. What gives you confidence on such a recovery, just given the macro environment and the uncertain outlook that we all have at the moment for the rest of the year? Are you seeing any signs on the ground of improvement, anything that gives you that confidence to go out and talk about 2024 right now?\nBob Sulentic: Yes Chandni, I\u2019ll comment and then I\u2019ll give it to Emma. First of all, we actually expect 2024 to not go back to \u201922 levels but actually exceed \u201922. A big part of that is the large portion of our business that\u2019s either secularly benefited or cyclically advantaged, all of that outsourcing business which in aggregate is now quite large. Anything we\u2019re doing for the industrial or multi-family asset classes, we expect to be strong by then. Project management will be strong, we expect the debt business to come back, so all of those circumstances are driving it. Now, the thing that would cause it to not happen is if we were wrong about the recession, if the recession was worse or lasted longer or started later, but those parts of our business are what we expect to drive that outcome. Emma, you may want to add to that.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, to put a little context around what those numbers look like, Chandni, if you think about our resilient lines of businesses, we\u2019ve talked about that being 40% contributor to our SOP. In 2022, it was 45% of our SOP; in 2023, it\u2019s going to be closer to 50% to 55% of our SOP, and those are our lines of business that we expect to continue to grow through a recession, so that\u2019s becoming a larger and larger part of our business. Then our transactional business lines, we expect them to rebound starting a little bit the end of 2023 into 2024, and what\u2019s important to know about that is the growth that\u2019s embedded in that outlook to get back to above 2022 levels means that our advisory lines of business, our transactional lines of business would need to grow less than they did in 2021. Putting that all together, it\u2019s very achievable. Then on top of that, what\u2019s not embedded in the 2024 guidance or our outlook is any sort of material capital allocation or M&A, which would put us far above 2022 levels.\nChandni Luthra: That\u2019s very helpful, and that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to talk about for my next question, but more focused on 2023. In terms of buybacks and just general capital allocation, you talked about using--you know, you talked about only a modest use of capital in 2023, and that means the buyback is not part of that EPS guide that you\u2019ve given today. But how would you rank buybacks and M&A in 2023 in terms of priority, and do you think buybacks could look much like 2022 in 2023?  Then switching gears to M&A a little bit, if M&A were to be part of the calculus, could you give us some parameters on what that could potentially look like, how much leverage would you be willing to tap into, and what would be the potential business lines that you would like to explore?\nEmma Giamartino: Sure. When we look at allocating capital, we look at buybacks and M&A and are weighing which is a better use of our capital and which can drive a greater long term return for us. In 2022, you saw there wasn\u2019t a significant amount of M&A opportunities, but obviously we\u2019re building our pipeline and continue to build our pipeline and are seeing things--conversations are starting to build and accelerate in a way that they did not in 2022. But because there wasn\u2019t a tremendous amount of M&A activity available, we repurchased almost $2 billion worth of shares and our share price was also at an attractive valuation, so we\u2019ll continue to look at that. We are constantly evaluating whether we\u2019re going to buy back or we\u2019re going to do a larger transformational acquisition, and we\u2019ll continue to do that throughout this year and we\u2019ll update you as that progresses; but in our outlook, we didn\u2019t include what that would look like because we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to unfold going forward. In terms of M&A, we are willing to go up to two times leverage for a transformational deal. If it was highly transformational, we\u2019d go slightly above that, but that\u2019s the range that we\u2019re looking at. Then with capital allocation overall, we want to, at the very least, end the year net leverage neutral, but we\u2019re willing to go above that for buybacks as well.\nChandni Luthra: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Bob, just circling back on the sales activity, I\u2019m just curious, in your mind, is the potential pick-up in activity more a function of the overall level of interest rates or more of a stabilization of rates and spreads, where people can actually know what their cost of capital is before they start to underwrite transactions? I\u2019m just trying to figure out which one\u2019s the bigger lever, the actual rate or the stabilization of rates.\nBob Sulentic: I think probably right now, it\u2019s the stabilization of rates. The other thing, Steve, that I think is going on is people are recognizing that with all the concerns about the economy, and obviously there are considerable concerns, the fundamentals in industrial and multi-family are really strong - really low vacancy rates, every reason in the world to believe that rental rates will go up at least somewhat, and that\u2019s in what\u2019s going to be a tough year and then longer term, it\u2019s going to be better. Then you have this just very human thing about sellers being ready to sell and buyers being ready to buy with capital and sitting on the sidelines for a long time. As soon as two or three circumstances start to line up favorably - fundamentals, stabilization of rents or rates, rates coming down a little bit, some talk in the market that maybe the recession won\u2019t be as bad as we thought. When you get that confluence of circumstances, things start to shake loose a little bit, and as soon as one or two buyers go into the market, others start to get into the market because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll be left behind.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. Then secondly, I was just hoping maybe Emma could provide a little more detail on what happened to Telford. It sounded like maybe costs got out of control. I just thought maybe you could expand on that a little bit, just to make sure we understand the problems and what\u2019s been rectified moving forward.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, absolutely. I do want to step back, and there\u2019s two major things going on that are different. The first is the U.K. put in a fire safety act which is still under review, related to a very terrible fire that happened in 2017, so through that act, they\u2019re requiring all home builders who have built a building over a certain size over the past 30 years to bring those buildings up to the current fire safety standard, so as a result, we and all other homebuilders in the U.K. are having to go through this process of determining what the cost will be across all of our buildings that we\u2019ve built over the next five, 10 years, as long as it takes us to remediate those issues, and that\u2019s where you see the non-cash, about $140 million reserve that we took in Q4. What\u2019s important to know about that is that is our best estimate of what we think the cost will be to remediate those, but the actual cash outflow to remediate those issues across those buildings will be over a very long period of time, so we view that as an isolated, anomalous issue that\u2019s occurring across all homebuilders in the U.K. The second piece is how the operations of our business are being impacted, and that\u2019s primarily related to the external environment, record cost inflation, we had a number of COVID slowdowns that we\u2019ve talked about over the past numbers of years within Telford specifically, so what we did in Q4 is we evaluated all of our projects, you saw that we impaired a number of assets and we took a $43 million loss in Q4 - for the full year, it was just shy of $50 million, and we believe that that\u2019s contained, that that\u2019s a very good estimate of the value of those assets going forward and that we\u2019re at an inflection point going forward, and we expect under new leadership and with the tailwinds behind U.K. build-to-rent, that that business will continue to grow going forward.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. I\u2019d just wonder, are you seeing any green shoots at all in the U.K. housing market from a demand perspective, or has that not yet started to pick up?\nBob Sulentic: A little bit, Steve. You know, we still have the economic circumstance that we have with high interest rates, with concerns about the economy that\u2019s causing people to not spend the way they would spend normally, so that\u2019s a little bit of downward pressure on the business, but we\u2019re encouraged by what we see in terms of the longer term trend. \nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Griffin: Great, thanks. Maybe we can go back to leasing for a second. I\u2019m just curious how your strategy around that might be changing, just given the longer term implications that remote and hybrid work could have on performance and impacting the space. I think, Bob, you\u2019ve talked about expanding in industrial, so maybe just how thoughts around that changed, and if you can remind us what percentage of the leasing revenue comes from the office sector, that\u2019d be helpful.\nBob Sulentic: Okay. Emma, why don\u2019t you--do you have that number, the percentage of our leasing that comes from office?\nEmma Giamartino: It is about--it\u2019s a little over 50%, and that\u2019s come down if you compare that to 2019, for example - it was closer to 70%, so that has steadily come down.\nBob Sulentic: Yes, so Michael, what I\u2019d say is our current assumption is that this downward pressure that we\u2019ve seen on office leasing is going to sustain for the time being. We haven\u2019t seen much change over the last few months in the return to office. We\u2019ve built a plan for the next several years that assumes that that is going to be the case. We assume that there\u2019s going to be a move over time from lesser quality to better quality assets, higher rates, higher rental rates, which will be a positive impact on the business, but definitely going forward we expect more of our income stream in the leasing business to come from industrial relative to office than it has--other than in last year, than it has in the longer term past, and we don\u2019t see that changing. The comments that Emma made about our plan for the next several years, our growth plan, fully incorporate that view.\nMichael Griffin: Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Then just one on geographic performance, it seems like your commentary and expectations around EMEA and APAC are maybe a bit incrementally more positive relative to the Americas. I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s anything driving those underlying assumptions - is it thoughts about economic growth or potential for a shallower recession there, but anything you can expand on, on performance of those other geographic segments, that\u2019d be helpful.\nBob Sulentic: Well first of all, we are now not expecting a recession in Europe, and we expect Europe to trend better than the U.S. in terms of return to the office. Then you go to Asia, and we expect Asia to be almost like it was historically as it relates to return to the office, and we have very strong businesses particularly in Korea, Japan and China relative to what we\u2019ve had historically and relative to our competition. We have a very strong business in Japan and we expect that business--it\u2019s become quite large for us and we expect it to continue to grow.  You have the economic backdrop that\u2019s positive, relatively speaking, and then you have the circumstance related to return to the office that\u2019s positive, relatively speaking, as you move from the U.S. to Europe to Asia, and then you have just the very strong relative business position that we have, particularly in Asia but also our businesses in Europe and the U.K. have gotten much stronger over the past few years on a relative basis, so you see all those things coming through.\nMichael Griffin: Great, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. First question would be if the move-in rates in the last couple of weeks have changed anything in terms of tone from major CBRE clients that you\u2019re hearing.\nBob Sulentic: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had a major impact, Jade. Everybody is in the--of the mindset that things are going to be uncertain for a while. I don\u2019t think the view as to how the year is going to play out has changed in any significant way. It certainly hasn\u2019t for us. Our view continues to be that we\u2019re going to have a relatively mild recession, that we\u2019re going to be out of it toward the end of the year, early next year, and that the capital markets are going to come back in the back half of the year, and we\u2019ve already walked through what we\u2019re seeing anecdotally. We are definitively seeing positive anecdotal signs. We don\u2019t want to over-rotate in terms of extrapolating too much from those anecdotal signs, but we think we\u2019ll see more of that in the back half of the year.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. When you look at the REI business overall, investment management and development, how much risk of further impairments do you anticipate? Valuation impairments, you mentioned you expect cap rates, for example, to increase another 25 basis points, but could you put some parameters around perhaps how you\u2019re thinking about any risk there?\nEmma Giamartino: Jade, I\u2019ll walk through development first and then our investment management business. On the development side, any impairments, and we don\u2019t think there should be significantly more this year, are embedded in our guidance for that segment, and as I noted in my remarks, we\u2019ve already generated $100 million of SOPs in January alone in our development business, so we feel pretty confident in how the development business will pan out for this year. On the investment management side, what we\u2019re expecting is slightly positive net flows for this year, so $5 billion primarily from our listed mandates and then also from infrastructure, and from our opportunistic funds to a lesser extent, and then we\u2019re also embedding a slight decrease in the market value of that AUM which will offset some of those net inflows.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. Just regarding the guidance, how much does capital markets and leasing picking up in the back half of the year drive the guidance? Is that really the main uncertainty in the guidance?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, and it\u2019s primarily capital markets that we\u2019re really expecting to pick up, mostly in Q4. Just to give, Jade, a little context around that, if our sales revenue comes in 5% lower than what we\u2019re expecting, for the full year that would have about a $0.02 EPS impact. Then on the leasing side, we\u2019re not relying on a massive rebound at the end of the year, but obviously we\u2019re guiding towards less of a decline in leasing for the full year. For leasing, if there\u2019s a 5% decline in revenue versus what we\u2019re expecting right now, that would have more like a 3% change to EPS, and on the sales side, I meant 2% change to EPS.\nJade Rahmani: Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful to have.  On the office side, is the uncertainty there, which seems secular in nature, causing a re-think of, I guess, resource allocation in that space, in that property sector, and any re-think of how that outfit is organized?\nBob Sulentic: Well, we have--Jade, we have multiple places that we play in the office sector, so starting with development, we develop it, we manage it, we sell it, we finance it. We\u2019ve sized our business and our capital allocation strategy consistent with the assumptions that we\u2019ve talked about here today, about where that business is going to be. The other place we play in the office sector is in our investment in Industrious. We think Industrious is going to continue to grow at a healthy clip. It\u2019s a really good offering with a really strong leadership team, and we are looking at that to be likely a bigger part of our business going forward. But we expect leasing to be as we described. We don\u2019t expect to do much development, although we\u2019ll do some development on build-to-suits - that will continue to be part of our business, and that\u2019s great business when you can do office build-to-suits with credit tenants, and that\u2019s what we would do. Then over time--there\u2019s all kinds of uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen in the financing markets, but over time there will be a good amount of financing work in the office space as well. \nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could speak to how you\u2019re thinking about free cash flow conversion as a percentage of your core net income in 2023.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, so we expect it to be roughly in line with where we were in 2022, which was about 75% free cash flow conversion. What\u2019s important to note about that is because we\u2019re in somewhat of a--we are in a declining market, there is inconsistency in timing in terms of how we accrue our bonuses and how we pay them out in cash. If you normalize for that timing in 2023, our free cash flow conversion is closer to mid-80s, which is where we want to be long term, so we should expect coming into 2024 that we should hit a more normalized growth environment in that mid-80% free cash flow conversion range.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Got it, thank you. What are you guys seeing right now in terms of talent retention? Given the slowdown in some of the brokerage areas, are brokers more inclined to want to move from place to place, or do you feel like you are able to retain all the key talent that you want to?\nBob Sulentic: This is the kind of environment that generally plays well for CBRE. When times are uncertain, it\u2019s harder to generate commissions on either leases or sales or financing opportunities. Brokers tend to want to go to a platform that\u2019s more likely to support them, so better information, bigger base of clients, better brand, a company that can be well positioned to invest in a downturn because they have a strong balance sheet. We\u2019re going to generate a lot of cash in 2023 and 2024, and the brokers that pay attention, the more sophisticated brokers know that and they know we\u2019ll be able to continue to invest in our business. It helps us retain and it helps us recruit, and Jack Durburg and the advisory team had a big year of recruiting last year and we\u2019re expecting that to play out the same way this year.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Great, thank you. Then last one for me, your in-process development projects decreased pretty substantially quarter over quarter, and there was some commentary about, I think, just some reticence given the macro landscape. How are you looking at that as we move into 2023? Could it slide a little bit further in the near term, or would you expect that to start to rebuild?\nEmma Giamartino: Our in-process, just to frame what our in-process is, that is projects that have either started construction or we own the land and it is expected to start construction within 12 months. The decline was primarily driven by projects in that latter category that we now believe are going to be more than 12 months off, and so they\u2019ve been moved into the pipeline category. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate our in-process portfolio, but if things move out of in-process at this point, again it\u2019s projects that won\u2019t be starting for more than 12 months, it will not impact 2023. It would have an impact to 2024 and beyond.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Bob Sulentic for closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report on our first quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thank you Bob. Before turning to our 2023 outlook, I'll first discuss fourth quarter results for each of our segments, starting with advisory on Slide 6. Advisory net revenue and SOPs declined by 21% and 33% respectively, driven by a slightly more pronounced decline in our higher margin transactional businesses than originally expected which was partially offset by healthy growth from our property management business. For capital markets, sales and mortgage origination combined revenue declined by 46%, in line with our expectations. Capital markets revenue growth was robust in last year's Q4, increasing by 53%, which accentuated the extent of this year's decline. Leasing revenue was down 7% both globally and in the Americas, a slightly bigger decline than we expected with a notable slowdown in office activity in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle. In total, global office leasing revenue was 14% below prior year after increasing by nearly 50% year to date through the third quarter, albeit against relatively easy prior year comparisons. Outside the U.S., leasing revenue was down 6% wholly due to FX translation headwinds. In local currency, lease revenue increased in both EMEA and Asia Pacific.  The 19% decline in loan servicing was attributable to fewer prepayments amid rising mortgage rates versus record prepayments in Q4 2021. Excluding prepayments, loan servicing revenue increased by 2%. Overall cost in advisory declined by 18%, but this was not enough to offset the 21% decrease in total new revenue. Turning to Slide 7, GWS net revenue grew by 13% with half of that increase coming from organic revenue growth. In local currency, net revenue excluding Turner & Townsend increased by 12% with facilities management up 9% and project management up 21%. GWS SOP increased by 30% with margin improvement driven partly by business mix.  Turner & Townsend continued to grow impressively. In the first full year since acquiring a 60% interest, Turner & Townsend has exceeded our original underwriting. 2022 represented our highest ever year for client contracts coming up for renewal, totaling over $4 billion. GWS renewed 94% of this total, often with increased scope of our client relationships. Looking forward, we expect 2023 renewals to be just over half the level of 2022. The GWS revenue pipeline ended the year up 11% over year-end 2021, reflecting continued demand from first generation and outsourcing clients as well as expansion mandates from our existing client base.  Turning to Slide 8, REI SOP declined to just $17 million in Q4 against an unusually strong prior year comparison. Our global development business posted a $6 million SOP loss primarily due to a $43 million loss in our Telford, U.K. development business. Lower SOP in U.S. development reflects the timing of assets dispositions, which were heavily weighted to this year's first half, consistent with our expectations going into the year. Following an in-depth review of the Telford business, we wrote down a handful of projects where we expect costs to exceed our initial underwriting, and we also increased our fire safety reserve. We now believe Telford financial performance will improve going forward. Investment management AUM grew $5 billion sequentially, driven by net capital inflows of $4 billion and positive FX movements which offset $5 billion of mark-to-market declines. Investment management SOPs declined due in part to co-investment losses versus a gain in the prior year quarter. Excluding co-investment gains and losses, investment management SOP was nearly flat with the prior year quarter. Turning to Slide 9, our 2023 outlook is underpinned by the following macroeconomic assumptions. The U.S. will experience a short, moderate recession in 2023, unemployment will increase to near 5%, inflation will end the year above the Fed's 2% target but clearly trending down, and 10-year U.S. treasury yields will end the year under 3.5%. Should the economic outlook change from this base case, our business outlook would also change. In our advisory segment, we expect a mid single digit revenue decline. This will be driven by growth in more resilient lines of business offset by a mid to high single digit decline in leasing and mid-teens decline in property sales. We expect SOP to decline by high single digits to low double digits as cost savings initiatives partially offset both relatively better growth in lower margin businesses and general cost inflation. In our property sales business, we expect the number of transactions will be subdued in the first half of the year and accelerate in the back half of the year. We expect our leasing business to continue to benefit from an elevated level of lease expirations. While the return to office has been slow in the U.S., EMEA and APAC have seen occupancy return at a faster pace. As a result, we expect these regions to be less pressed than the Americas in 2023. For property management and valuations, we expect accelerating revenue growth in both kinds of business due to recent investments in sales support and tuck-in acquisitions, as well as less FX pressure. Within GWS, we expect low double digit new revenue and SOP growth with margins increasing slightly as cost savings more than offset inflation and incremental investment to support growth.  Our facilities management business is benefiting from new wins and expansions. All major client sectors are expected to grow, notably in healthcare and technology where the changing use of real estate is driving increased demand for outsourcing services that we believe CBRE is best positioned to deliver. We also expect continued momentum in our project management businesses, including double digit top and bottom line growth from our Turner & Townsend business. Within our REI segment, we expect SOP in the mid $300 million range with roughly equal contributions from development and investment management. Within our TCC development business, we expect SOP of just over 1% of our nearly $17 billion in-process portfolio, and we've closed over $100 million of expected SOP in January alone. Our TCC business has developed a portfolio of assets that we believe is extremely well positioned for the current market environment with approximately 75% of our expected SOP in 2023 from industrial deals. While our Telford business remains challenged, we do expect improvement versus 2022 as significant cost inflation is now incorporated into projected results, adding approximately $20 million to SOP versus 2022.  Beyond our three main business segments, we also expect roughly flat corporate overhead and our full year core tax rate to rise to 2021 levels versus a lower 2022 rate. Consistent with our approach last year, the 2023 outlook assumes only a modest use of capital. That said, we continue to have a strong appetite for M&A and share repurchase, both of which could support incremental earnings growth above our current outlook, and we do not anticipate ending 2023 in a net cash position. In summary, we expect core EBITDA to decline by high single digits versus 2022 with over half attributable to the decline in development SOP. We expect core EPS to decline by low to mid double digits versus 2022. This is more than the core EBITDA decline because of higher depreciation and amortization and a higher tax rate than in 2022, when we had a number of one-time benefits that will not recur. Lastly, we expect nearly two-thirds of full year core EPS in the back half of the year, a more pronounced seasonality to earnings than we historically experienced.  The $400 million cost containment program we announced last quarter is embedded in our guidance. Fourth quarter results saw a nearly $80 million cost benefit and we expect a cost benefit in 2023 of approximately $300 million, with the remainder in 2024. The entirety of the cost containment program will be reflected in our run rate by the end of this year. We expect that our cost containment efforts will allow us to counteract the general inflation pressures and enable us to make continued investments to support future growth. Last year, we refreshed our 2025 financial guidance which implied CBRE would achieve core EPS between $8 and $9 by year-end 2025, absent meaningful capital allocation. Due to the real estate transaction downturn, our target is now likely to slip by 12 to 18 months. As I noted previously, our 2025 targets were established on the basis that there would not be a recession following the COVID recovery. The drivers of how we achieve this core EPS growth are largely unchanged. At the midpoint of that core EPS target, $8.50, CBRE will have achieved double digit compound core EPS growth since 2019 despite needing to manage through two significant downturns. It also represents a high teens CAGR from our 2023 projection. In closing, we remain excited about CBRE's prospects for long term growth, the strength of our brand, and our ability to outperform during periods of market weakness.  With that, Operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yes, to put a little context around what those numbers look like, Chandni, if you think about our resilient lines of businesses, we've talked about that being 40% contributor to our SOP. In 2022, it was 45% of our SOP; in 2023, it's going to be closer to 50% to 55% of our SOP, and those are our lines of business that we expect to continue to grow through a recession, so that's becoming a larger and larger part of our business. Then our transactional business lines, we expect them to rebound starting a little bit the end of 2023 into 2024, and what's important to know about that is the growth that's embedded in that outlook to get back to above 2022 levels means that our advisory lines of business, our transactional lines of business would need to grow less than they did in 2021. Putting that all together, it's very achievable. Then on top of that, what's not embedded in the 2024 guidance or our outlook is any sort of material capital allocation or M&A, which would put us far above 2022 levels. Sure. When we look at allocating capital, we look at buybacks and M&A and are weighing which is a better use of our capital and which can drive a greater long term return for us. In 2022, you saw there wasn't a significant amount of M&A opportunities, but obviously we're building our pipeline and continue to build our pipeline and are seeing things--conversations are starting to build and accelerate in a way that they did not in 2022. But because there wasn't a tremendous amount of M&A activity available, we repurchased almost $2 billion worth of shares and our share price was also at an attractive valuation, so we'll continue to look at that. We are constantly evaluating whether we're going to buy back or we're going to do a larger transformational acquisition, and we'll continue to do that throughout this year and we'll update you as that progresses; but in our outlook, we didn't include what that would look like because we don't know how it's going to unfold going forward. In terms of M&A, we are willing to go up to two times leverage for a transformational deal. If it was highly transformational, we'd go slightly above that, but that's the range that we're looking at. Then with capital allocation overall, we want to, at the very least, end the year net leverage neutral, but we're willing to go above that for buybacks as well. Yes, absolutely. I do want to step back, and there's two major things going on that are different. The first is the U.K. put in a fire safety act which is still under review, related to a very terrible fire that happened in 2017, so through that act, they're requiring all home builders who have built a building over a certain size over the past 30 years to bring those buildings up to the current fire safety standard, so as a result, we and all other homebuilders in the U.K. are having to go through this process of determining what the cost will be across all of our buildings that we've built over the next five, 10 years, as long as it takes us to remediate those issues, and that's where you see the non-cash, about $140 million reserve that we took in Q4. What's important to know about that is that is our best estimate of what we think the cost will be to remediate those, but the actual cash outflow to remediate those issues across those buildings will be over a very long period of time, so we view that as an isolated, anomalous issue that's occurring across all homebuilders in the U.K. The second piece is how the operations of our business are being impacted, and that's primarily related to the external environment, record cost inflation, we had a number of COVID slowdowns that we've talked about over the past numbers of years within Telford specifically, so what we did in Q4 is we evaluated all of our projects, you saw that we impaired a number of assets and we took a $43 million loss in Q4 - for the full year, it was just shy of $50 million, and we believe that that's contained, that that's a very good estimate of the value of those assets going forward and that we're at an inflection point going forward, and we expect under new leadership and with the tailwinds behind U.K. build-to-rent, that that business will continue to grow going forward. It is about--it's a little over 50%, and that's come down if you compare that to 2019, for example - it was closer to 70%, so that has steadily come down. Jade, I'll walk through development first and then our investment management business. On the development side, any impairments, and we don't think there should be significantly more this year, are embedded in our guidance for that segment, and as I noted in my remarks, we've already generated $100 million of SOPs in January alone in our development business, so we feel pretty confident in how the development business will pan out for this year. On the investment management side, what we're expecting is slightly positive net flows for this year, so $5 billion primarily from our listed mandates and then also from infrastructure, and from our opportunistic funds to a lesser extent, and then we're also embedding a slight decrease in the market value of that AUM which will offset some of those net inflows. Yes, and it's primarily capital markets that we're really expecting to pick up, mostly in Q4. Just to give, Jade, a little context around that, if our sales revenue comes in 5% lower than what we're expecting, for the full year that would have about a $0.02 EPS impact. Then on the leasing side, we're not relying on a massive rebound at the end of the year, but obviously we're guiding towards less of a decline in leasing for the full year. For leasing, if there's a 5% decline in revenue versus what we're expecting right now, that would have more like a 3% change to EPS, and on the sales side, I meant 2% change to EPS. Yes, so we expect it to be roughly in line with where we were in 2022, which was about 75% free cash flow conversion. What's important to note about that is because we're in somewhat of a--we are in a declining market, there is inconsistency in timing in terms of how we accrue our bonuses and how we pay them out in cash. If you normalize for that timing in 2023, our free cash flow conversion is closer to mid-80s, which is where we want to be long term, so we should expect coming into 2024 that we should hit a more normalized growth environment in that mid-80% free cash flow conversion range. Our in-process, just to frame what our in-process is, that is projects that have either started construction or we own the land and it is expected to start construction within 12 months. The decline was primarily driven by projects in that latter category that we now believe are going to be more than 12 months off, and so they've been moved into the pipeline category. We'll continue to evaluate our in-process portfolio, but if things move out of in-process at this point, again it's projects that won't be starting for more than 12 months, it will not impact 2023. It would have an impact to 2024 and beyond."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you Brad, and good morning everyone. As you've seen, we reported core EPS of $1.33 for the fourth quarter. While down significantly from a year ago, core earnings were slightly above the estimate we provided at the end of the third quarter. This outcome was driven by several of the more cyclically resilient elements of our business, like outsourcing and others that are secularly favored, like project management and the logistics asset class. These businesses, which together comprise about 45% of our core EBITDA, grew revenue more than we expected, offset by a slightly larger than expected decline in transactional revenue. Full year core EPS grew 7% to $5.69. This is a solid growth rate considering the more than doubling of long term interest rates, sharp equity market decline, and the credit crunch that constrained investment activity for most of the second half. Notably, we ended 2022 with virtually no leverage despite making share repurchases, infill M&A, and strategic investments that together totaled approximately $2.1 billion during the year. Looking at the macro environment, cap rates are up 100 to 150 basis points, perhaps a bit more for office, and we expect them to expand another 25 basis points or so before peaking, likely in Q2. While capital largely remains on the sidelines, we are beginning to see signs of asset re-pricing helped along by the narrowing of spreads. Among property types, multi-family and industrial fundamentals should remain strong, albeit with occupancy declining slightly from peak levels and rent growth continuing at a more modest clip than the double-digit pace set in 2022. Office will remain the most challenged property type as we do not expect occupancy to come close to pre-pandemic levels in the short term. Globally, we expect significant sales and leasing weakness in the first half before adverse conditions begin to ease later in 2023. Relative to 2022, we expect both Europe and Asia Pacific to outperform the Americas this year. For 2023, we expect core EPS to decline by low to mid double digits but still to be the third highest in CBRE's history. As we've pointed out before, this would be a meaningfully better performance than in prior recessions, such as the global financial crisis when core EPS decreased more than 60%. In all, 2023 will be a transition year and we feel good about where we'll be when we get to the other side of the downturn. While the macro environment can certainly change, we expect core EPS to grow strongly in 2024, exceeding the 2022 peak and reaching a record level in just the first year after a recession. With that, I'll hand the call to Emma, who will discuss our quarter and our outlook in greater detail. Emma? Tony, first of all, even if the work you do for a client in a specific portion of their portfolio is shrinking, it likely would result in project management work, potentially transaction management work, portfolio management work, so even if you have some shrinkage within an account, there are opportunities for revenue. But secondly, there is the addition of new accounts which has been very significant for us for the past year, actually record levels, and we're expecting that going forward, where people are giving us more property to manage because they want to save cost, so the combination of those factors has allowed us to grow that business consistently over the years during downturns, and we expect it's going to be a double-digit grower in 2023 for the same reasons. Yes, and you're asking with regard to property sales? Yes, okay. Well, where we're seeing activity in sales is for good assets, even in some cases office assets if they're Class A buildings, fully leased, but for sure industrial and multi-family. If you went back to last year, even the end of last year, you would get a couple bidders that would test the waters, but now for some of the better quality assets, we're getting several bidders and they're bidding aggressively, and there's anecdotes on multi-family, there's anecdotes on industrial in particular where we're seeing that happen. It's quite a bit different than it was last year. There is a lot of capital that's been on the sidelines wanting to acquire assets. There's a lot of asset owners that have wanted to sell assets, and we're starting to see spreads come in a little bit now and the buyers get a little more aggressive in various cases, so that's what you're seeing there. With leasing, we continue to see very strong fundamentals in industrial. There is low vacancy, there are a lot of companies out there that still need space for a variety of reasons, and so we are seeing momentum there, and then you have, as we said before, you have a considerable amount of renewal activity around office buildings and retail in particular. Yes Chandni, I'll comment and then I'll give it to Emma. First of all, we actually expect 2024 to not go back to '22 levels but actually exceed '22. A big part of that is the large portion of our business that's either secularly benefited or cyclically advantaged, all of that outsourcing business which in aggregate is now quite large. Anything we're doing for the industrial or multi-family asset classes, we expect to be strong by then. Project management will be strong, we expect the debt business to come back, so all of those circumstances are driving it. Now, the thing that would cause it to not happen is if we were wrong about the recession, if the recession was worse or lasted longer or started later, but those parts of our business are what we expect to drive that outcome. Emma, you may want to add to that. I think probably right now, it's the stabilization of rates. The other thing, Steve, that I think is going on is people are recognizing that with all the concerns about the economy, and obviously there are considerable concerns, the fundamentals in industrial and multi-family are really strong - really low vacancy rates, every reason in the world to believe that rental rates will go up at least somewhat, and that's in what's going to be a tough year and then longer term, it's going to be better. Then you have this just very human thing about sellers being ready to sell and buyers being ready to buy with capital and sitting on the sidelines for a long time. As soon as two or three circumstances start to line up favorably - fundamentals, stabilization of rents or rates, rates coming down a little bit, some talk in the market that maybe the recession won't be as bad as we thought. When you get that confluence of circumstances, things start to shake loose a little bit, and as soon as one or two buyers go into the market, others start to get into the market because they're afraid they'll be left behind. A little bit, Steve. You know, we still have the economic circumstance that we have with high interest rates, with concerns about the economy that's causing people to not spend the way they would spend normally, so that's a little bit of downward pressure on the business, but we're encouraged by what we see in terms of the longer term trend. Okay. Emma, why don't you--do you have that number, the percentage of our leasing that comes from office? Yes, so Michael, what I'd say is our current assumption is that this downward pressure that we've seen on office leasing is going to sustain for the time being. We haven't seen much change over the last few months in the return to office. We've built a plan for the next several years that assumes that that is going to be the case. We assume that there's going to be a move over time from lesser quality to better quality assets, higher rates, higher rental rates, which will be a positive impact on the business, but definitely going forward we expect more of our income stream in the leasing business to come from industrial relative to office than it has--other than in last year, than it has in the longer term past, and we don't see that changing. The comments that Emma made about our plan for the next several years, our growth plan, fully incorporate that view. Well first of all, we are now not expecting a recession in Europe, and we expect Europe to trend better than the U.S. in terms of return to the office. Then you go to Asia, and we expect Asia to be almost like it was historically as it relates to return to the office, and we have very strong businesses particularly in Korea, Japan and China relative to what we've had historically and relative to our competition. We have a very strong business in Japan and we expect that business--it's become quite large for us and we expect it to continue to grow.  You have the economic backdrop that's positive, relatively speaking, and then you have the circumstance related to return to the office that's positive, relatively speaking, as you move from the U.S. to Europe to Asia, and then you have just the very strong relative business position that we have, particularly in Asia but also our businesses in Europe and the U.K. have gotten much stronger over the past few years on a relative basis, so you see all those things coming through. I don't think it's had a major impact, Jade. Everybody is in the--of the mindset that things are going to be uncertain for a while. I don't think the view as to how the year is going to play out has changed in any significant way. It certainly hasn't for us. Our view continues to be that we're going to have a relatively mild recession, that we're going to be out of it toward the end of the year, early next year, and that the capital markets are going to come back in the back half of the year, and we've already walked through what we're seeing anecdotally. We are definitively seeing positive anecdotal signs. We don't want to over-rotate in terms of extrapolating too much from those anecdotal signs, but we think we'll see more of that in the back half of the year. Well, we have--Jade, we have multiple places that we play in the office sector, so starting with development, we develop it, we manage it, we sell it, we finance it. We've sized our business and our capital allocation strategy consistent with the assumptions that we've talked about here today, about where that business is going to be. The other place we play in the office sector is in our investment in Industrious. We think Industrious is going to continue to grow at a healthy clip. It's a really good offering with a really strong leadership team, and we are looking at that to be likely a bigger part of our business going forward. But we expect leasing to be as we described. We don't expect to do much development, although we'll do some development on build-to-suits - that will continue to be part of our business, and that's great business when you can do office build-to-suits with credit tenants, and that's what we would do. Then over time--there's all kinds of uncertainty about what's going to happen in the financing markets, but over time there will be a good amount of financing work in the office space as well. This is the kind of environment that generally plays well for CBRE. When times are uncertain, it's harder to generate commissions on either leases or sales or financing opportunities. Brokers tend to want to go to a platform that's more likely to support them, so better information, bigger base of clients, better brand, a company that can be well positioned to invest in a downturn because they have a strong balance sheet. We're going to generate a lot of cash in 2023 and 2024, and the brokers that pay attention, the more sophisticated brokers know that and they know we'll be able to continue to invest in our business. It helps us retain and it helps us recruit, and Jack Durburg and the advisory team had a big year of recruiting last year and we're expecting that to play out the same way this year. Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report on our first quarter."

Now please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Sulentic: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Lower core EPS in the third quarter reflected a sharp deterioration in the macro environment, particularly with regard to capital availability for transactions. Nevertheless, core EPS was well above any third quarter in our history except for last year's especially strong result. Even in light of a $0.07 drag in this year's quarter from foreign currency effects, this underscores the resiliency we built into the business. In contrast with last year's strong third quarter, the capital markets environment weakened materially as the quarter progressed. Property sales performed in line with expectations in July and August, however, most debt and equity capital sources moved to the sidelines after Labor Day, causing both sales and loan originations to fall sharply. In addition, as expected and previously communicated, we completed far fewer development asset sales this year than in last year's strong third quarter, mostly driven by the front end loading of asset sales this year. We also delayed selling some assets during the third quarter. As we noted last quarter, when market dislocations cause transaction activity to decline, those transactions are typically paused and returned to the market when the uncertainty passes. We took advantage of the temporary market dislocation to continue repurchasing shares at an elevated clip. In contrast with sales and financing, leasing performed very well. Revenue was up across all property types, led by office. In addition, as we discussed previously, many parts of our business are either cyclically resilient or benefit from secular tailwinds. These businesses, including occupier outsourcing, valuations, property management, loan servicing, investment management and project management, posted solid results for the quarter. We plan to further capitalize on our balance sheet to invest in secularly favored parts of our business that add differentiated capabilities. Over the last 2 years, project management, flex office space, renewable energy and industrial and multifamily assets have been at the forefront of those efforts. Going forward, in addition to those areas, we are particularly focused on both enterprise and local facilities management, investment management and the more cyclically resilient advisory business lines, while also continuing our share repurchase program. As we prepare for a tougher operating environment, Emma will discuss how we have already been identifying cost savings, while aiming to continue investments that will sustain long-term growth. Many economists, including our own, have cautioned that the market outlook is especially difficult to forecast right now because of an unusual confluence of high inflation, coupled with strong consumer spending, resilient employment growth amid a tightening credit cycle and residual pandemic and Ukraine war-related challenges. With this caveat in mind, we have updated our full year core EPS growth expectations to be up mid-single digits compared with 2021. Absent the challenging foreign currency comparisons, we expect our 2022 core EPS growth would achieve low double-digit growth over 2021. While economic downturns are never welcome, they present opportunities to consolidate our position as global occupiers and investors, gravitate to the industry leader. We fully intend to make the most of these opportunities. With that, I'll hand the call to Emma for a deeper commentary on the quarter and our outlook.\nEmma Giamartino: Thank you, Bob. As Bob noted, global economic sentiment has deteriorated since our last quarterly update. More specifically, and as you've all been following closely, since we last reported, the 10-year treasury rate has spiked 140 basis points, the S&P 500 has declined by 7% and public rate prices have fallen by 16%. The futures market is now indicating that the Federal Reserve will raise rates more steeply and ease them less quickly, resulting in a harsher and longer downturn than when we last reported. It is worth reiterating that this has all happened in just the last 90 days. This more negative backdrop began to impact our business late in the third quarter, and there will be more impacts in the fourth quarter. CBRE's core EPS fell 19% from the prior year to $1.13. And as Bob noted, the drivers were weakening capital market conditions, the timing of development asset sales and a foreign currency headwind. Our results were, however, supported by the continued growth in the lines of business that, as Bob noted earlier, we see as cyclically resilient or secularly favored. Net revenue from these businesses collectively increased 12% in local currency, excluding the contribution from Turner & Townsend, and 24% in local currency, including Turner & Townsend, $284 million of net revenue in Q3. Finally, our GAAP EPS grew by 7% in the quarter due to a $183 million mark-to-market gain on our investment in Altus Power, which continues to benefit from demand for renewable energy solutions and its synergy with our CBRE businesses. I'll discuss results for each business segment, starting with advisory on Slide 6. Total advisory revenue rose 1% in the quarter or 5% in local currency, though performance diverged across business lines. Capital markets weakness emerged immediately following Labor Day, which historically has been a time of heightened sales activity. The decline was most pronounced in our Americas region, where property sales revenue fell 16% during the quarter. While Americas Capital Markets revenue, which includes sales and debt origination was relatively flat for July and August, September revenue fell by 43%. Outside the Americas, property sales rose 3% or 17% in local currency for the quarter. The decline in US property sales reflects sharply reduced credit availability. Typically, credit spreads have tightened as rates rise. However, higher rates have been accompanied over the past few months by credit spread expansion. Many capital sources have tightened underwriting standards considerably and set pricing at levels that are uneconomical for borrowers. Against this backdrop, our mortgage origination revenue declined by 28% versus last year's Q3, while the value of loans originated fell 34%. Revenue declined less than loan volumes because more financing in the quarter came from the government-sponsored enterprises, which we had expected to occur during periods of market weakness. The decline in credit availability was broad-based, with only regional banks lending more than in last year's Q3. Difficult comparisons further impacted year-over-year growth. Our combined property sales and debt origination businesses grew by 79% in last year's third quarter, driven by a resurgence of activity following the brief 2020 recession. We were encouraged to see our leasing revenue increased 14% or 17% in local currency, driven by large office and industrial transactions in major markets. Globally, leasing revenue increased across all major property types, with office growing mid-teens off a low base and industrial up high single digits. Property management, valuation and loan servicing all proved to be resilient as expected, collectively realizing net revenue growth of 2% or 8% in local currency. Advisory Services segment operating profit declined by 19% or 15% in local currency. Overall, advisory margins on net revenue declined by 4.2 percentage points, including the decline in loan origination-related OMSRs. Slide 7 illustrates the drivers of advisory's lower margin versus prior year. Just over half the decline in Advisory segment, operating profit margin is attributable to higher cost of services. with advisory gross margins declining 2.2 percentage points year-over-year or 1.9%, excluding OMSRs. Approximately 80 basis points of the gross margin decline is due to higher broker commissions. Strong growth in the front half of the year resulted in an outsized number of brokers achieving higher splits earlier than we've seen historically. This will also impact the fourth quarter, albeit to a lesser degree, before the annual recent next year. For context, approximately 1/3 of our U.S. brokers had historically reached higher tranches by the third quarter. For 2022, the percentage of U.S. brokers reaching higher tranches is almost 50%. It is important to note that our average commission expense naturally increases during strong years and declines during soft years. For example, in 2020, only 1/4 of producers had reached a higher tranche by the third quarter. The remainder of the gross margin decline is due to investments to support growth, broker recruitment costs and revenue mix as revenue erosion with steepest in debt originations, our highest margin line of business. Additionally, advisory operating expenses increased by $47 million or 10%, with the majority of the increase due to hiring that occurred in late 2021 or early 2022 as we prepared for a more robust growth environment and higher employee compensation reflecting a tight labor market. While we have and will continue to invest in target areas of growth in our business, we've also undertaken an equally targeted cost-cutting program, which I'll discuss shortly. While we began reducing operating expenditures during the third quarter, which shows the lowest year-over-year growth in OpEx since Q1 2021, only a fraction of our cost-cutting program was implemented during Q3, and thus did not fully reflect the impact of those reductions. We expect our cost programs to result in a single-digit year-over-year decline in Advisory segment OpEx in the fourth quarter. On Slide 8, our GWS segment posted strong net revenue growth of 8% or 13% in local currency, excluding the contribution from Turner & Townsend, and 32% in local currency, including the contribution from Turner & Townsend. Both Facilities Management and Project Management net revenue grew organically by double digits in local currency. We also remain pleased with Turner & Townsend, which is performing in line with expectations. Facilities management growth was supported by significant expansion work on our existing client base, particularly with technology clients. And project management growth was driven by Phase II designs and fit-outs, often tied to our clients' changing use of office space. Our GWS new business pipeline is on pace to end the year above the prior year's fourth quarter, with the opportunities coming from new and existing clients across a range of industries. GWS' segment operating profit margin on net revenue was 11%, excluding the impact of Turner & Townsend, down from an unusually strong third quarter of last year. The 11% margin represents a sequential improvement and was in line with our expectations as margins continue to normalize from COVID-related highs. Turning to our REI segment on Slide 9. Segment operating profit of $59 million represents an $88 million decline from the prior year. You'll remember last quarter, we told you 75% of the REI segment's total operating profit will be realized in the first half of the year due to the cadence of our development asset sales. The segment operating profit decline is predominantly due to this anticipated deal timing. Within REI, Investment Management realized operating profit of $44 million, down 12% from last year. In local currency, the decline was 4%. Beyond FX, prior quarter results were bolstered by an $11 million positive mark-to-market on our $335 million co-investment portfolio versus negligible mark-to-market in the current quarter. The overall decline as continued growth of asset management fees, which increased by 19% in local currency, even though adverse currency movement reduced AUM to $143.9 billion. Our development business realized $17 million of operating profit against $100 million in the prior year, reflecting fewer asset sales during the third quarter. While we expected most of this decline when we provided our last quarterly update, we elected to pause on selling certain assets as we wait for capital market sentiment to improve. And as we noted last quarter, our development business utilizes highly flexible financing, which enables us to monetize assets when market conditions are accommodating and to pause when appropriate. Please turn to Slide 10. While we can't dictate the macroeconomic environment, we can control our costs and how we allocate our capital. We are targeting over $400 million of cost reductions due to management actions. This is in addition to the naturally flexible cost reductions when business declines, such as discretionary bonuses, incentive compensation, profit sharing and commissions. As discussed last quarter, CBRE can ramp up cost reduction activities as market conditions necessitate. Our current cost reduction program is driven by our base economic assumptions, which, as we've discussed, envision a more challenging economy than we communicated last quarter. Approximately $300 million of targeted cost reductions will be permanent in nature, with the vast majority coming from headcount reductions. Beyond headcount reductions, we also anticipate permanent reductions to our cost basis for third-party and occupancy spending. The balance of the savings, approximately $100 million, is more temporary in nature, but we will continue that until market conditions have improved. These cost savings will come from reduced travel and entertainment, promotion and marketing spending and reductions to discretionary compensation plan. And to be clear, the planned reductions to discretionary compensation are above and beyond the natural flexibility of these plans that are already tied to financial performance. Against our $400 million cost target, we have identified $175 million to be completed by the end of the year with a significant majority of the remainder to be completed by the end of Q1 2023. Only a small percentage of the cost reductions taken to date are reflected in Q3 results due to a slight lag between taking action on headcount reductions and having those cost savings reflected in financial results. Given the nature of our cost structure, almost all of the planned reduction will be reflected in our operating expenditures, although we do anticipate achieving targeted reductions to some of the more fixed costs within our cost of services. While we are adjusting our costs, you can expect us to invest more aggressively utilizing our balance sheet during market weakness. In the third quarter, CBRE repurchased 5.1 million shares for $408 million, bringing our share repurchases through Q3 to nearly $1.4 billion. We expect share repurchases to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, ranging between $500 million and $700 million. We also continue to remain an increasingly robust pipeline of M&A opportunities. Current market conditions are increasing the likelihood that we'll be able to act on them. For now though, buybacks remain the best use of capital, but that may change as we get into next year. Please turn to Slide 11. As we've discussed today, the broader economic outlook has worsened since our last update, necessitating that we revised our expectations for full year performance. As Bob indicated, we now expect full year core EPS growth to be up by mid-single digits compared with 2021. Our guidance most notably assumes that the capital markets remain under pressure. We expect leasing to remain more resilient than property sales, albeit with more muted growth than we saw in the third quarter. Due to the headwinds in our transactional businesses, we expect full year Advisory segment operating profit to decline by mid- to high single digits, with FX driving 3 to 4 percentage points of the decline. We expect our GWS segment will achieve low to mid-20% segment operating profit growth for the full year, fueled by continued strength in the fourth quarter. Absent foreign currency headwinds, we project segment operating profit growth for the full year in GWS would be 7 percentage points higher. Within our REI segment, we believe we have realized approximately 90% of our full year segment operating profit, largely due to the expectation of a few development asset sales in the fourth quarter. As noted previously, our outlook has been negatively impacted by the continued strength in the U.S. dollar. At midyear, we forecasted a $100 million full year negative impact to core EBITDA from FX. We've now raised the expected FX drag to $125 million for the full year, with $50 million hitting in Q4. Absent FX, we anticipate that core EPS growth would have been in the low double digits for the full year. We remind investors that it is difficult to forecast macro conditions and certain components of our business, notably capital markets, the timing of development sales and to a lesser extent, leasing are subject to fluctuations in overall economic sentiment. In closing, while near-term headwinds are intensifying, we remain as energized as ever about our long-term prospects and are committed to using our scale, balance sheet and cash flow to accelerate long-term growth and value creation. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChandni Luthra: So I understand that it's too early for 2023 outlook at this point. But if you could please perhaps give us some parameters to frame 2023. Like what would you need to see engines in capital markets to get restarted? Is there a way to frame capital market activity in terms of first half versus second half? Like when do you think the outlook really starts to get better?\nEmma Giamartino: Chandni, it's something that we're very focused on. And we're working through our budgets right now to really determine what we're expecting in 2023. But from a macro level, if you look back to what we said 90 days ago, we view that we would be in a mild recession and that it would raise would peak in Q1 of 2023, and they would start to alleviate through 2023. Our position now is that things have materially changed. We've seen that impacting our capital markets business directly. We are getting hit harder and faster than we were expecting 90 days ago, and we're expecting the recession to impact our business for longer than we did 90 days ago. And so looking to next year, we do expect the capital markets to come back likely in the second half of the year, but that return is going to be more muted than what we initially expected when we talked to you in Q2.\nChandni Luthra: That's actually helpful color. Switching gears to margins a little bit. So 13% margins in the quarter, down 450 bps. It's better than 3Q '19, but then, of course, the worst is still ahead of us. So help us frame margins in the context of 2019. Given that the macro is about to get much tougher and what you framed in your answer just recently, how should we think about margins in the context of 2019? Is there a scenario do you think we go all the way? Or do you think there is some recourse in the cost-cutting plans that you laid out?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. And Sandy, I'm going to talk about advisory specifically because that's the most relevant piece, I think, what you're speaking to. And hopefully, it's clear what happened in Q3, but I just want to go through that. In Q3, and we have this on Slide 7 as you all saw, I think it's always important to look at our advisory margin, excluding OMSRs. That was 30 basis points of the decline that OMSRs are peer margin. So when they grow, they're adding margin and when they decline, 100% of that margin comes out. The second is we are in -- because of the phenomenal first half of the year we had and the exceptional growth we delivered, our producers entered higher tranches much earlier than they ever have before. So that was 80 basis points of the margin decline. And those tranches reset at the end of the year. So we don't expect that to be a headwind in 2023. And then the 2 remaining pieces are producer recruiting, where we are investing in our future growth in the first half, we delivered again, exceptional growth, and we were investing in our costs to support that growth going forward. And then on the operating expense side, again, we also were investing in new hires. We under-invested in 2021, simply because revenue accelerated faster than we can pick up our investments. And then we also increased -- we had wage inflation just as every other company had. So going forward, what we're seeing looking into Q4, we should expect that operating expense growth continue to come down. If you look at the first half of the year, our operating expense in advisory was up about -- over 19%. In Q3, our operating expenses came down to 10% growth year-over-year. And in Q4, that should -- our operating expense should decline year-over-year, and this is within advisory. And that's -- there's 2 components to how those costs are coming out. One is our discretionary cost levers that we can pull, going back on travel and entertainment, continuing to pull back on new hires. Pulling back on new hires takes longer for that to come into our cost savings, and then our discretionary bonuses. You'll also see some impact from our $400 million cost savings program, but that's going to be a meaningful lag there. Most of those savings, you'll see in 2023, and that's because we take action on reducing headcount. And there is a lag in terms of when those costs come out of the system. So net, where we expect to end the year in advisory, we expect our margin to be over 19% within advisory. Excluding OMSRs, our margin should be over 18%. And that's an important number because that is a record margin, excluding 2021, when our margins were inflated because our costs had not caught up to our revenue growth.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Emma, maybe just sticking on this margin discussion in advisory. So if I'm understanding this right, if -- on the Page 7, that 190 basis point drag in the third quarter from OpEx, that actually flips and becomes a little bit of a benefit in 4Q. And so if I'm kind of understanding and putting some narrative around this, is it just that come 4Q, you lose some of the drags on the cost side and the margin side, but you're more impacted by maybe the drawdown on the revenue side?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. And so in Q4, across advisory, we're expecting net revenue year-over-year to decline roughly 20%. And so -- but we're also expecting margin expansion because of the cost. So you're right.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Got it. And then just within advisory in the quarter, just kind of understand mortgage originations and loan servicing a bit better. I just -- I would thought mortgage originations would be a little bit more insulated because people going to have to refinance and do things, whereas investment sales, they maybe don't have to sell the asset, but that didn't seem to be the case. Like any thoughts on just maybe why that was or if that like reverts?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Tony, that is just a function of the fact that we had 2 things go on, rates went up and spreads went up. Typically, when you see rates go up the way they did, spreads will come down a little, but both of them went up. And people just avoided refinancing because it was so expensive. It's that simple. We had -- and we had that circumstance play out in a way that was beyond what we would have expected. Now here's what I'll say about that. It's going to -- we think in the fourth quarter that you will see financing perform better than new sales. People are just not going to come back and trade assets until interest rates go down and until they think they can get the pricing they want, which will happen after -- in our view, after the Fed starts to go the other direction with interest rates, which we -- which, as Emma said in her prepared remarks, we think may happen later next year. But that's really what you saw happen in Q3 and especially what you saw happen in September.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Got it. And then just last one for me on the leasing side. You pointed out offices having been pretty strong. It's also a fairly cyclical property type. Like how much more runway do you think is left there to get back to normal when you kind of net that against maybe perhaps activity slowing because of the more macroeconomic factors?\nRobert Sulentic: Tony, when you say how much runway is it until that gets back to normal? Give a little more on that. I want to make sure I understand what you're asking there.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, sure. I was under the impression like office maybe looked particularly good because you were still having some of the post-COVID recovery in just decision-making, but maybe that's off.\nRobert Sulentic: No, no. What's going on is, in fact, that there was -- and we talked about this last quarter, there were abundance of renewals in the marketplace to be done. We'll see that continue this year and into next year. But what we also expect to see now is some downward pressure as we go into a recession. There's always downward pressure on leasing in a recession because people are looking around trying to find ways to defer costs, save money. And so what they -- you have this dynamic that goes on, where they extend for a short period of time, et cetera. So we expect to see some of that come in and leasing to be more flattish in the fourth quarter, but we still expect some of the benefit from the built-up number of renewals that need to be dealt with to occur in the fourth quarter and into next year.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. So it sounds like maybe it's a net kind of flattish number between sort of the renewals getting cleared and the headwind from the macro?\nRobert Sulentic: That's what we think. And maybe a little down, but that's how we think it's going to play out.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. And Tony, for Q4 specifically, we're expecting leasing to be flat.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Just a couple. Emma, just on that last point, you said Q4 leasing to be flat in office. Is that -- I just want to be clear, is that year-over-year?\nEmma Giamartino: To be clear, that's flat globally across all product types, and that's year-over-year.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. I was wondering if you could just provide any comments on the industrial sales market. I know that's an area that you guys have been fairly active in. It's obviously been one of the more favored asset types within REIT land, but we have seen a pullback in that leasing market as well. So I'm just curious if you have any comments on kind of industrial cap rates and the appetite today?\nRobert Sulentic: Industrial cap rates like all cap rates have gone up. Industrial fundamentals have remained very strong. They backed off a little bit. We've seen a little bit of downward pressure on rental rates in some areas. We've seen slightly more vacancy, although the fundamentals are very, very strong. The markets held up very well. In the major markets, very little vacancy, strong demand still. So that has created a circumstance where there are buyers for the assets and there are owners of assets and developers, investors and developers that want to sell, but they're just not going to sell in the current environment because cap rates have ticked up and finance is expensive. And in our own portfolio as a developer, we've made the choice to defer sales for some of our assets -- some of our industrial assets. And I think what happened is we've already commented -- or what will happen, as we've already commented. When that circumstance eases, and we think that likely will be the second half of next year, those assets in the pipeline will get sold. Pipelines are very strong. The pipeline of assets that sellers want to sell and buyers want to buy are strong. And we think, starting in the second half of next year, you'll see all of that free up to a degree and start -- that market activity start to happen.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Just I guess one more question. If you could provide any comments around sort of the industrious and office kind of leasing business that you guys have. And I'm just curious what uptake you've seen in that business and just kind of the short-term office leasing business?\nRobert Sulentic: Well, office leasing and Industrious, they share some dynamics but they're different. Industrious provides a capability in the marketplace that's unique. You can get in and out quickly. You can get in and out without capital expenditure. You can adjust the amount of space you have very quickly. You can go into places that you don't intend to be long term. And with all the uncertainty around the use of office space and where it's going to go, Industrious' business has done quite well, and we believe it will continue to do quite well. And we're very excited about that investment and the performance of that investment. We've already commented today on office space. There is what you're seeing in leasing on office space is a pent-up amount of renewal activity and uncertainty about the -- about what's going to happen long term with offices. There's also a big bifurcation in how different parts of the office market are performing with the best buildings. The premier building is doing quite well with rents up and the less quality, less favored buildings suffering much more.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Sorry, Bob, my question wasn't clear. I wasn't trying to follow up on Tony's question. I was really asking specifically about the trends in Industrious just what maybe market share you're seeing the WeWorks, the Regis, the Industrious is taking in the industrial -- I'm sorry, in the office leasing business against kind of traditional office leasing?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes. And that was my comment. That's where I started with Industrious. The trends that Industrious is seeing in the marketplace are very positive. We would characterize it as a record level of interest in that type of space. And it's been subjected to some different dynamics than regular office space. It creates flexibility. It creates the opportunity to get in and out of office space without capital expenditure. It creates the opportunity to get into a smaller amount of space and more convenient locations that you may not want to commit to long term. And as a result, it's doing extremely well.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jade rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani: What are you seeing in the GSE multifamily lending business? Historically, they've been countercyclical providers of capital. They don't price to a securitization exit, at least private label. And so their spreads may not be as wide. And they do have ample capacity on the FHFA governed lending caps. Are you seeing them step up in this point in time?\nEmma Giamartino: Jade, we are seeing the GSEs pick up in this past quarter. They contributed a larger portion of our volumes than they did in the prior quarter. So picked up from 20% of our volume to 25% in the quarter. So they are offsetting some of the declines from private lenders, but the entire market is down. And so even though they are picking up, it's not as material as you might expect.\nJade Rahmani: In terms of REI's prospects, how sensitive is the outlook to where interest rates are? Meaning if projects weren't stabilized, need to finance at a mortgage that's in the [indiscernible], is that going to inhibit sales out of that segment for potentially a longer-than-expected period?\nEmma Giamartino: Think through the remainder of this year.\nJade Rahmani: Say for next year. I mean the timing of the outlook isn't that important, but I'm more concerned about if mortgage rates were stickier at, say, something in the 6% range, would that really inhibit a lot of those projects that are waiting to be sold. Would that inhibit the ability to sell those?\nEmma Giamartino: So the way we think about development and we've provided a range of conversion and that we picked our in-process portfolio, which is currently over $19 billion. And typically, that converts to SOP in the range of 1% to 2% in any given 12-month period. Going into a recession, and this is what we said last quarter going into '23, we'd expect that in a mild recession, we should get to the bottom end of that range, into the 1% range. And that's driven by 2 pieces. One, cap rate expansion so that we're monetizing the assets of a lower return, but also the ability for us to choose, to wait, to sell the assets until the environment improves. We have a really strong balance sheet. We have a really flexible thing. So that allows us to make the decision that we don't want to monetize in a challenging environment, and we don't want to wait to sell. And so it will be at the low end of the 1%. And then if the environment is very challenging, it could dip slightly below that 1%. But that's -- but I want to remind everyone that, that doesn't mean those asset sales and monetizations are going away. So it should then appear in 2024 or whenever as the market recovers.\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, I'm going to add to that. That's true of our portfolio, and that's true of everybody else's portfolio in general, those asset sales will happen eventually. The assets are there. They're ready to be moved from one party to another. But the parties aren't going to do that until they feel like they're confident in the fairness of the pricing on the sell side and the buy side and the availability of financing that works.\nJade Rahmani: Just more broadly speaking, on Investment Management. I mean, as long as I've covered this space, the theory has been institutionalization, increased allocations to real estate from LPs, sovereign wealth funds, et cetera. And for the first time, we're starting to hear chatter that's in the opposite direction that there's an over allocation because of the decline in equity markets and fixed income and then LPs are getting nervous about allocating to CRE. Has anything really changed on that long-term secular trend in your view?\nRobert Sulentic: Not on the long term sense. Nothing at all has changed in that regard. In the short term, you're describing the denominator effect, which we haven't seen it for a long time, but we have seen it before. And it will -- I think we will revert back to the trends we saw previously over the last decade. We're quite confident that will be the case. That's what we're very actively engaged with capital sources around the world, and that's where their head is at. But we do have this short-term circumstance that's precipitated by the debt markets and also the denominate effect, and that's really what we're seeing here and hearing about.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nStephen Sheldon: First, I wanted to dig in more on the GWS new business pipeline. I think you said it increased significantly in the third quarter. Is there anything specific, I guess, driving that? And as macro uncertainty having any impact there in terms of the lane decision-making, or could it actually be creating more urgency to outsource to vendors like CBRE in this type of environment, but just love some more detail on what you're seeing there?\nRobert Sulentic: Stephen, there's a number of factors at play there. Whenever you go into periods of financial stress, companies everywhere look for opportunities to save cost. Our outsourcing offering helps them save cost. It's demonstrably able to do that. And so that's helping that capability sell in the marketplace right now. The other thing in times of economic uncertainty is sometimes decision-making is slower. And so while we have this large pipeline, you may see some slower decision-making. The third thing that's going on is we are continually adding to our capability in that area. Our procurement capability is getting better. The data that we can provide clients to help them make decisions is getting much better. We have a product called Vantage Analytics that they like a lot that helps them make decisions that causes them to be attracted to us. Our ability to connect our offering around the world and serve them in a way that's consistent is getting better. So that is all playing to our favor. And that's some of what you've seen come through this year and the buildup of the pipeline and the landing of new business, but the cost factor is always at the top of the list when we dig into that business and figure out what clients really want.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. That's really helpful. And then the follow-up, I guess, just wanted to ask as we kind of think about FX headwinds. I think you report your currency exposures and the SEC filings to revenue, but just curious if your expenses would also -- your expense exposure would also closely correlate to that? Or would you call out anything there where there's a material mismatch?\nEmma Giamartino: It's generally aligned. Our cost is being impacted in a very similar way to our revenue.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: After the global financial crisis, it took, I think, probably 7 or 8 years for industry sales activity to rebound at peak levels. And then after the pandemic, it obviously just took one year. Given kind of what you're seeing in the macro right now, how are you thinking about the pace of recovery of the sales outlook and whether we're seeing deals just delayed or whether deals get canceled?\nRobert Sulentic: Well, Patrick, one thing that's interesting is how long it's been now since the financial crisis. The cycles that we had previous to that were shorter. And so that kind of impacts people's thinking -- the other thing that impacts people thinking is they forget how deep the financial crisis was and how unusual it was compared to other downturns. But I can tell you what we're seeing now, and we've used this term multiple times on this call pipeline. There is a definitive, identifiable pipeline of projects across property types that want to be sold by the owners. And there is a lot of capital out there that wants to buy and neither of them think this is the right time to transact. That's what you're really seeing. We believe that when interest rates start to go the other direction, when the Fed reverses course because they think that the economy has gotten to a point where continued upward pressure on interest rates goes from being a problem-solving circumstance to a problem creating circumstance that we will see that pipeline start to transact, and it will recover. We can't give an exact number of years, but it will recover considerably more rapidly than it did coming out of the financial crisis.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. That's helpful. And then as to your expense reductions, obviously, you guys took some expense actions during the pandemic. How much more room do you have to cut before you get into the muscle and maybe you start potentially losing market share?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes. Well, Emma commented on the $400 million number. That's the number we believe we can cut without impacting our ability to grow the business and serve our clients in the future. So a lot of work went into -- from the grassroots level up and from top down to identify that $400 million number. And I want to stress again something Emma said, we have a massive amount of our cost basis that flexes automatically when revenues go down, commissions, profit sharing and development and investment management, incentive equity, bonuses, all of that is completely independent of this $400 million, $300 million of which we think will be permanent and $100 million of which we think will come back when things get better. And we don't think that, that $400 million will create problems for our business at all.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up coming from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead.\nJade Rahmani: A question investors often ask is where our commercial or let's just say, capital markets overall versus some prior periods, say, 2018, 2017? But I know that you all are constantly hiring producers. So could you give any sense for what the growth rate in number of producer headcount have been on the brokerage side relative to some past period so that we could adjust for that? And also, I think even if commercial real estate prices decline, the absolute nominal dollar of commercial real estate value is probably significantly higher than it was in 2017. So hard to compare next year versus 2017. But any color on that would probably be helpful.\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Jade, we'll give a conceptual answer to that. We don't have specific numbers on brokers, but we have had a strong year for brokerage recruiting and it was intentional because we believe that the opportunity to grow that business in the long term is there, and we believe it was the right time to get into the market and bring some new brokers on. So relative to history, it would stack up well relative to our good brokerage recruiting years in the past, but we don't have specific numbers for you on that.\nOperator: This brings us to the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Sulentic for closing comments.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report our year-end results.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in CBRE.

            "content": "Thank you, Bob. As Bob noted, global economic sentiment has deteriorated since our last quarterly update. More specifically, and as you've all been following closely, since we last reported, the 10-year treasury rate has spiked 140 basis points, the S&P 500 has declined by 7% and public rate prices have fallen by 16%. The futures market is now indicating that the Federal Reserve will raise rates more steeply and ease them less quickly, resulting in a harsher and longer downturn than when we last reported. It is worth reiterating that this has all happened in just the last 90 days. This more negative backdrop began to impact our business late in the third quarter, and there will be more impacts in the fourth quarter. CBRE's core EPS fell 19% from the prior year to $1.13. And as Bob noted, the drivers were weakening capital market conditions, the timing of development asset sales and a foreign currency headwind. Our results were, however, supported by the continued growth in the lines of business that, as Bob noted earlier, we see as cyclically resilient or secularly favored. Net revenue from these businesses collectively increased 12% in local currency, excluding the contribution from Turner & Townsend, and 24% in local currency, including Turner & Townsend, $284 million of net revenue in Q3. Finally, our GAAP EPS grew by 7% in the quarter due to a $183 million mark-to-market gain on our investment in Altus Power, which continues to benefit from demand for renewable energy solutions and its synergy with our CBRE businesses. I'll discuss results for each business segment, starting with advisory on Slide 6. Total advisory revenue rose 1% in the quarter or 5% in local currency, though performance diverged across business lines. Capital markets weakness emerged immediately following Labor Day, which historically has been a time of heightened sales activity. The decline was most pronounced in our Americas region, where property sales revenue fell 16% during the quarter. While Americas Capital Markets revenue, which includes sales and debt origination was relatively flat for July and August, September revenue fell by 43%. Outside the Americas, property sales rose 3% or 17% in local currency for the quarter. The decline in US property sales reflects sharply reduced credit availability. Typically, credit spreads have tightened as rates rise. However, higher rates have been accompanied over the past few months by credit spread expansion. Many capital sources have tightened underwriting standards considerably and set pricing at levels that are uneconomical for borrowers. Against this backdrop, our mortgage origination revenue declined by 28% versus last year's Q3, while the value of loans originated fell 34%. Revenue declined less than loan volumes because more financing in the quarter came from the government-sponsored enterprises, which we had expected to occur during periods of market weakness. The decline in credit availability was broad-based, with only regional banks lending more than in last year's Q3. Difficult comparisons further impacted year-over-year growth. Our combined property sales and debt origination businesses grew by 79% in last year's third quarter, driven by a resurgence of activity following the brief 2020 recession. We were encouraged to see our leasing revenue increased 14% or 17% in local currency, driven by large office and industrial transactions in major markets. Globally, leasing revenue increased across all major property types, with office growing mid-teens off a low base and industrial up high single digits. Property management, valuation and loan servicing all proved to be resilient as expected, collectively realizing net revenue growth of 2% or 8% in local currency. Advisory Services segment operating profit declined by 19% or 15% in local currency. Overall, advisory margins on net revenue declined by 4.2 percentage points, including the decline in loan origination-related OMSRs. Slide 7 illustrates the drivers of advisory's lower margin versus prior year. Just over half the decline in Advisory segment, operating profit margin is attributable to higher cost of services. with advisory gross margins declining 2.2 percentage points year-over-year or 1.9%, excluding OMSRs. Approximately 80 basis points of the gross margin decline is due to higher broker commissions. Strong growth in the front half of the year resulted in an outsized number of brokers achieving higher splits earlier than we've seen historically. This will also impact the fourth quarter, albeit to a lesser degree, before the annual recent next year. For context, approximately 1/3 of our U.S. brokers had historically reached higher tranches by the third quarter. For 2022, the percentage of U.S. brokers reaching higher tranches is almost 50%. It is important to note that our average commission expense naturally increases during strong years and declines during soft years. For example, in 2020, only 1/4 of producers had reached a higher tranche by the third quarter. The remainder of the gross margin decline is due to investments to support growth, broker recruitment costs and revenue mix as revenue erosion with steepest in debt originations, our highest margin line of business. Additionally, advisory operating expenses increased by $47 million or 10%, with the majority of the increase due to hiring that occurred in late 2021 or early 2022 as we prepared for a more robust growth environment and higher employee compensation reflecting a tight labor market. While we have and will continue to invest in target areas of growth in our business, we've also undertaken an equally targeted cost-cutting program, which I'll discuss shortly. While we began reducing operating expenditures during the third quarter, which shows the lowest year-over-year growth in OpEx since Q1 2021, only a fraction of our cost-cutting program was implemented during Q3, and thus did not fully reflect the impact of those reductions. We expect our cost programs to result in a single-digit year-over-year decline in Advisory segment OpEx in the fourth quarter. On Slide 8, our GWS segment posted strong net revenue growth of 8% or 13% in local currency, excluding the contribution from Turner & Townsend, and 32% in local currency, including the contribution from Turner & Townsend. Both Facilities Management and Project Management net revenue grew organically by double digits in local currency. We also remain pleased with Turner & Townsend, which is performing in line with expectations. Facilities management growth was supported by significant expansion work on our existing client base, particularly with technology clients. And project management growth was driven by Phase II designs and fit-outs, often tied to our clients' changing use of office space. Our GWS new business pipeline is on pace to end the year above the prior year's fourth quarter, with the opportunities coming from new and existing clients across a range of industries. GWS' segment operating profit margin on net revenue was 11%, excluding the impact of Turner & Townsend, down from an unusually strong third quarter of last year. The 11% margin represents a sequential improvement and was in line with our expectations as margins continue to normalize from COVID-related highs. Turning to our REI segment on Slide 9. Segment operating profit of $59 million represents an $88 million decline from the prior year. You'll remember last quarter, we told you 75% of the REI segment's total operating profit will be realized in the first half of the year due to the cadence of our development asset sales. The segment operating profit decline is predominantly due to this anticipated deal timing. Within REI, Investment Management realized operating profit of $44 million, down 12% from last year. In local currency, the decline was 4%. Beyond FX, prior quarter results were bolstered by an $11 million positive mark-to-market on our $335 million co-investment portfolio versus negligible mark-to-market in the current quarter. The overall decline as continued growth of asset management fees, which increased by 19% in local currency, even though adverse currency movement reduced AUM to $143.9 billion. Our development business realized $17 million of operating profit against $100 million in the prior year, reflecting fewer asset sales during the third quarter. While we expected most of this decline when we provided our last quarterly update, we elected to pause on selling certain assets as we wait for capital market sentiment to improve. And as we noted last quarter, our development business utilizes highly flexible financing, which enables us to monetize assets when market conditions are accommodating and to pause when appropriate. Please turn to Slide 10. While we can't dictate the macroeconomic environment, we can control our costs and how we allocate our capital. We are targeting over $400 million of cost reductions due to management actions. This is in addition to the naturally flexible cost reductions when business declines, such as discretionary bonuses, incentive compensation, profit sharing and commissions. As discussed last quarter, CBRE can ramp up cost reduction activities as market conditions necessitate. Our current cost reduction program is driven by our base economic assumptions, which, as we've discussed, envision a more challenging economy than we communicated last quarter. Approximately $300 million of targeted cost reductions will be permanent in nature, with the vast majority coming from headcount reductions. Beyond headcount reductions, we also anticipate permanent reductions to our cost basis for third-party and occupancy spending. The balance of the savings, approximately $100 million, is more temporary in nature, but we will continue that until market conditions have improved. These cost savings will come from reduced travel and entertainment, promotion and marketing spending and reductions to discretionary compensation plan. And to be clear, the planned reductions to discretionary compensation are above and beyond the natural flexibility of these plans that are already tied to financial performance. Against our $400 million cost target, we have identified $175 million to be completed by the end of the year with a significant majority of the remainder to be completed by the end of Q1 2023. Only a small percentage of the cost reductions taken to date are reflected in Q3 results due to a slight lag between taking action on headcount reductions and having those cost savings reflected in financial results. Given the nature of our cost structure, almost all of the planned reduction will be reflected in our operating expenditures, although we do anticipate achieving targeted reductions to some of the more fixed costs within our cost of services. While we are adjusting our costs, you can expect us to invest more aggressively utilizing our balance sheet during market weakness. In the third quarter, CBRE repurchased 5.1 million shares for $408 million, bringing our share repurchases through Q3 to nearly $1.4 billion. We expect share repurchases to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, ranging between $500 million and $700 million. We also continue to remain an increasingly robust pipeline of M&A opportunities. Current market conditions are increasing the likelihood that we'll be able to act on them. For now though, buybacks remain the best use of capital, but that may change as we get into next year. Please turn to Slide 11. As we've discussed today, the broader economic outlook has worsened since our last update, necessitating that we revised our expectations for full year performance. As Bob indicated, we now expect full year core EPS growth to be up by mid-single digits compared with 2021. Our guidance most notably assumes that the capital markets remain under pressure. We expect leasing to remain more resilient than property sales, albeit with more muted growth than we saw in the third quarter. Due to the headwinds in our transactional businesses, we expect full year Advisory segment operating profit to decline by mid- to high single digits, with FX driving 3 to 4 percentage points of the decline. We expect our GWS segment will achieve low to mid-20% segment operating profit growth for the full year, fueled by continued strength in the fourth quarter. Absent foreign currency headwinds, we project segment operating profit growth for the full year in GWS would be 7 percentage points higher. Within our REI segment, we believe we have realized approximately 90% of our full year segment operating profit, largely due to the expectation of a few development asset sales in the fourth quarter. As noted previously, our outlook has been negatively impacted by the continued strength in the U.S. dollar. At midyear, we forecasted a $100 million full year negative impact to core EBITDA from FX. We've now raised the expected FX drag to $125 million for the full year, with $50 million hitting in Q4. Absent FX, we anticipate that core EPS growth would have been in the low double digits for the full year. We remind investors that it is difficult to forecast macro conditions and certain components of our business, notably capital markets, the timing of development sales and to a lesser extent, leasing are subject to fluctuations in overall economic sentiment. In closing, while near-term headwinds are intensifying, we remain as energized as ever about our long-term prospects and are committed to using our scale, balance sheet and cash flow to accelerate long-term growth and value creation. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Chandni, it's something that we're very focused on. And we're working through our budgets right now to really determine what we're expecting in 2023. But from a macro level, if you look back to what we said 90 days ago, we view that we would be in a mild recession and that it would raise would peak in Q1 of 2023, and they would start to alleviate through 2023. Our position now is that things have materially changed. We've seen that impacting our capital markets business directly. We are getting hit harder and faster than we were expecting 90 days ago, and we're expecting the recession to impact our business for longer than we did 90 days ago. And so looking to next year, we do expect the capital markets to come back likely in the second half of the year, but that return is going to be more muted than what we initially expected when we talked to you in Q2. Yes. And Sandy, I'm going to talk about advisory specifically because that's the most relevant piece, I think, what you're speaking to. And hopefully, it's clear what happened in Q3, but I just want to go through that. In Q3, and we have this on Slide 7 as you all saw, I think it's always important to look at our advisory margin, excluding OMSRs. That was 30 basis points of the decline that OMSRs are peer margin. So when they grow, they're adding margin and when they decline, 100% of that margin comes out. The second is we are in -- because of the phenomenal first half of the year we had and the exceptional growth we delivered, our producers entered higher tranches much earlier than they ever have before. So that was 80 basis points of the margin decline. And those tranches reset at the end of the year. So we don't expect that to be a headwind in 2023. And then the 2 remaining pieces are producer recruiting, where we are investing in our future growth in the first half, we delivered again, exceptional growth, and we were investing in our costs to support that growth going forward. And then on the operating expense side, again, we also were investing in new hires. We under-invested in 2021, simply because revenue accelerated faster than we can pick up our investments. And then we also increased -- we had wage inflation just as every other company had. So going forward, what we're seeing looking into Q4, we should expect that operating expense growth continue to come down. If you look at the first half of the year, our operating expense in advisory was up about -- over 19%. In Q3, our operating expenses came down to 10% growth year-over-year. And in Q4, that should -- our operating expense should decline year-over-year, and this is within advisory. And that's -- there's 2 components to how those costs are coming out. One is our discretionary cost levers that we can pull, going back on travel and entertainment, continuing to pull back on new hires. Pulling back on new hires takes longer for that to come into our cost savings, and then our discretionary bonuses. You'll also see some impact from our $400 million cost savings program, but that's going to be a meaningful lag there. Most of those savings, you'll see in 2023, and that's because we take action on reducing headcount. And there is a lag in terms of when those costs come out of the system. So net, where we expect to end the year in advisory, we expect our margin to be over 19% within advisory. Excluding OMSRs, our margin should be over 18%. And that's an important number because that is a record margin, excluding 2021, when our margins were inflated because our costs had not caught up to our revenue growth. Yes. And so in Q4, across advisory, we're expecting net revenue year-over-year to decline roughly 20%. And so -- but we're also expecting margin expansion because of the cost. So you're right. Yes. And Tony, for Q4 specifically, we're expecting leasing to be flat. To be clear, that's flat globally across all product types, and that's year-over-year. Jade, we are seeing the GSEs pick up in this past quarter. They contributed a larger portion of our volumes than they did in the prior quarter. So picked up from 20% of our volume to 25% in the quarter. So they are offsetting some of the declines from private lenders, but the entire market is down. And so even though they are picking up, it's not as material as you might expect. Think through the remainder of this year. So the way we think about development and we've provided a range of conversion and that we picked our in-process portfolio, which is currently over $19 billion. And typically, that converts to SOP in the range of 1% to 2% in any given 12-month period. Going into a recession, and this is what we said last quarter going into '23, we'd expect that in a mild recession, we should get to the bottom end of that range, into the 1% range. And that's driven by 2 pieces. One, cap rate expansion so that we're monetizing the assets of a lower return, but also the ability for us to choose, to wait, to sell the assets until the environment improves. We have a really strong balance sheet. We have a really flexible thing. So that allows us to make the decision that we don't want to monetize in a challenging environment, and we don't want to wait to sell. And so it will be at the low end of the 1%. And then if the environment is very challenging, it could dip slightly below that 1%. But that's -- but I want to remind everyone that, that doesn't mean those asset sales and monetizations are going away. So it should then appear in 2024 or whenever as the market recovers. It's generally aligned. Our cost is being impacted in a very similar way to our revenue."

            "name": "Robert Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Lower core EPS in the third quarter reflected a sharp deterioration in the macro environment, particularly with regard to capital availability for transactions. Nevertheless, core EPS was well above any third quarter in our history except for last year's especially strong result. Even in light of a $0.07 drag in this year's quarter from foreign currency effects, this underscores the resiliency we built into the business. In contrast with last year's strong third quarter, the capital markets environment weakened materially as the quarter progressed. Property sales performed in line with expectations in July and August, however, most debt and equity capital sources moved to the sidelines after Labor Day, causing both sales and loan originations to fall sharply. In addition, as expected and previously communicated, we completed far fewer development asset sales this year than in last year's strong third quarter, mostly driven by the front end loading of asset sales this year. We also delayed selling some assets during the third quarter. As we noted last quarter, when market dislocations cause transaction activity to decline, those transactions are typically paused and returned to the market when the uncertainty passes. We took advantage of the temporary market dislocation to continue repurchasing shares at an elevated clip. In contrast with sales and financing, leasing performed very well. Revenue was up across all property types, led by office. In addition, as we discussed previously, many parts of our business are either cyclically resilient or benefit from secular tailwinds. These businesses, including occupier outsourcing, valuations, property management, loan servicing, investment management and project management, posted solid results for the quarter. We plan to further capitalize on our balance sheet to invest in secularly favored parts of our business that add differentiated capabilities. Over the last 2 years, project management, flex office space, renewable energy and industrial and multifamily assets have been at the forefront of those efforts. Going forward, in addition to those areas, we are particularly focused on both enterprise and local facilities management, investment management and the more cyclically resilient advisory business lines, while also continuing our share repurchase program. As we prepare for a tougher operating environment, Emma will discuss how we have already been identifying cost savings, while aiming to continue investments that will sustain long-term growth. Many economists, including our own, have cautioned that the market outlook is especially difficult to forecast right now because of an unusual confluence of high inflation, coupled with strong consumer spending, resilient employment growth amid a tightening credit cycle and residual pandemic and Ukraine war-related challenges. With this caveat in mind, we have updated our full year core EPS growth expectations to be up mid-single digits compared with 2021. Absent the challenging foreign currency comparisons, we expect our 2022 core EPS growth would achieve low double-digit growth over 2021. While economic downturns are never welcome, they present opportunities to consolidate our position as global occupiers and investors, gravitate to the industry leader. We fully intend to make the most of these opportunities. With that, I'll hand the call to Emma for a deeper commentary on the quarter and our outlook. Yes, Tony, that is just a function of the fact that we had 2 things go on, rates went up and spreads went up. Typically, when you see rates go up the way they did, spreads will come down a little, but both of them went up. And people just avoided refinancing because it was so expensive. It's that simple. We had -- and we had that circumstance play out in a way that was beyond what we would have expected. Now here's what I'll say about that. It's going to -- we think in the fourth quarter that you will see financing perform better than new sales. People are just not going to come back and trade assets until interest rates go down and until they think they can get the pricing they want, which will happen after -- in our view, after the Fed starts to go the other direction with interest rates, which we -- which, as Emma said in her prepared remarks, we think may happen later next year. But that's really what you saw happen in Q3 and especially what you saw happen in September. Tony, when you say how much runway is it until that gets back to normal? Give a little more on that. I want to make sure I understand what you're asking there. No, no. What's going on is, in fact, that there was -- and we talked about this last quarter, there were abundance of renewals in the marketplace to be done. We'll see that continue this year and into next year. But what we also expect to see now is some downward pressure as we go into a recession. There's always downward pressure on leasing in a recession because people are looking around trying to find ways to defer costs, save money. And so what they -- you have this dynamic that goes on, where they extend for a short period of time, et cetera. So we expect to see some of that come in and leasing to be more flattish in the fourth quarter, but we still expect some of the benefit from the built-up number of renewals that need to be dealt with to occur in the fourth quarter and into next year. That's what we think. And maybe a little down, but that's how we think it's going to play out. Industrial cap rates like all cap rates have gone up. Industrial fundamentals have remained very strong. They backed off a little bit. We've seen a little bit of downward pressure on rental rates in some areas. We've seen slightly more vacancy, although the fundamentals are very, very strong. The markets held up very well. In the major markets, very little vacancy, strong demand still. So that has created a circumstance where there are buyers for the assets and there are owners of assets and developers, investors and developers that want to sell, but they're just not going to sell in the current environment because cap rates have ticked up and finance is expensive. And in our own portfolio as a developer, we've made the choice to defer sales for some of our assets -- some of our industrial assets. And I think what happened is we've already commented -- or what will happen, as we've already commented. When that circumstance eases, and we think that likely will be the second half of next year, those assets in the pipeline will get sold. Pipelines are very strong. The pipeline of assets that sellers want to sell and buyers want to buy are strong. And we think, starting in the second half of next year, you'll see all of that free up to a degree and start -- that market activity start to happen. Well, office leasing and Industrious, they share some dynamics but they're different. Industrious provides a capability in the marketplace that's unique. You can get in and out quickly. You can get in and out without capital expenditure. You can adjust the amount of space you have very quickly. You can go into places that you don't intend to be long term. And with all the uncertainty around the use of office space and where it's going to go, Industrious' business has done quite well, and we believe it will continue to do quite well. And we're very excited about that investment and the performance of that investment. We've already commented today on office space. There is what you're seeing in leasing on office space is a pent-up amount of renewal activity and uncertainty about the -- about what's going to happen long term with offices. There's also a big bifurcation in how different parts of the office market are performing with the best buildings. The premier building is doing quite well with rents up and the less quality, less favored buildings suffering much more. Yes. And that was my comment. That's where I started with Industrious. The trends that Industrious is seeing in the marketplace are very positive. We would characterize it as a record level of interest in that type of space. And it's been subjected to some different dynamics than regular office space. It creates flexibility. It creates the opportunity to get in and out of office space without capital expenditure. It creates the opportunity to get into a smaller amount of space and more convenient locations that you may not want to commit to long term. And as a result, it's doing extremely well. Yes, I'm going to add to that. That's true of our portfolio, and that's true of everybody else's portfolio in general, those asset sales will happen eventually. The assets are there. They're ready to be moved from one party to another. But the parties aren't going to do that until they feel like they're confident in the fairness of the pricing on the sell side and the buy side and the availability of financing that works. Not on the long term sense. Nothing at all has changed in that regard. In the short term, you're describing the denominator effect, which we haven't seen it for a long time, but we have seen it before. And it will -- I think we will revert back to the trends we saw previously over the last decade. We're quite confident that will be the case. That's what we're very actively engaged with capital sources around the world, and that's where their head is at. But we do have this short-term circumstance that's precipitated by the debt markets and also the denominate effect, and that's really what we're seeing here and hearing about. Stephen, there's a number of factors at play there. Whenever you go into periods of financial stress, companies everywhere look for opportunities to save cost. Our outsourcing offering helps them save cost. It's demonstrably able to do that. And so that's helping that capability sell in the marketplace right now. The other thing in times of economic uncertainty is sometimes decision-making is slower. And so while we have this large pipeline, you may see some slower decision-making. The third thing that's going on is we are continually adding to our capability in that area. Our procurement capability is getting better. The data that we can provide clients to help them make decisions is getting much better. We have a product called Vantage Analytics that they like a lot that helps them make decisions that causes them to be attracted to us. Our ability to connect our offering around the world and serve them in a way that's consistent is getting better. So that is all playing to our favor. And that's some of what you've seen come through this year and the buildup of the pipeline and the landing of new business, but the cost factor is always at the top of the list when we dig into that business and figure out what clients really want. Well, Patrick, one thing that's interesting is how long it's been now since the financial crisis. The cycles that we had previous to that were shorter. And so that kind of impacts people's thinking -- the other thing that impacts people thinking is they forget how deep the financial crisis was and how unusual it was compared to other downturns. But I can tell you what we're seeing now, and we've used this term multiple times on this call pipeline. There is a definitive, identifiable pipeline of projects across property types that want to be sold by the owners. And there is a lot of capital out there that wants to buy and neither of them think this is the right time to transact. That's what you're really seeing. We believe that when interest rates start to go the other direction, when the Fed reverses course because they think that the economy has gotten to a point where continued upward pressure on interest rates goes from being a problem-solving circumstance to a problem creating circumstance that we will see that pipeline start to transact, and it will recover. We can't give an exact number of years, but it will recover considerably more rapidly than it did coming out of the financial crisis. Yes. Well, Emma commented on the $400 million number. That's the number we believe we can cut without impacting our ability to grow the business and serve our clients in the future. So a lot of work went into -- from the grassroots level up and from top down to identify that $400 million number. And I want to stress again something Emma said, we have a massive amount of our cost basis that flexes automatically when revenues go down, commissions, profit sharing and development and investment management, incentive equity, bonuses, all of that is completely independent of this $400 million, $300 million of which we think will be permanent and $100 million of which we think will come back when things get better. And we don't think that, that $400 million will create problems for our business at all. Yes, Jade, we'll give a conceptual answer to that. We don't have specific numbers on brokers, but we have had a strong year for brokerage recruiting and it was intentional because we believe that the opportunity to grow that business in the long term is there, and we believe it was the right time to get into the market and bring some new brokers on. So relative to history, it would stack up well relative to our good brokerage recruiting years in the past, but we don't have specific numbers for you on that. Thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report our year-end results."

For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in our remarks to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. I'm joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial and Investment Officer. Now please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Sulentic: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an outstanding second quarter with strength across our global businesses. All 3 business segments posted double-digit revenue and segment operating profit growth despite the significant currency headwinds that affected all U.S.-based global companies. Core EPS was the highest for any quarter in CBRE's history, up 37% and from last year's second quarter, and even slightly higher than last year's record fourth quarter. These results reflect the benefits of the diversification strategy we've described in detail on previous calls and an economic backdrop that was still generally supportive despite heightened macro concerns. Highlights for the quarter include a record level of new occupier outsourcing contracts; strong growth in project management, aided by Turner & Townsend, strong growth in leasing; and record real estate development profits. We ended the quarter with excellent new business pipelines across numerous lines of business, which Emma will review. We also repurchased more than $600 million worth of our own shares, the most ever in any quarter, bringing year-to-date share repurchases through July to nearly $1.1 billion. Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, Emma's remarks will take a different approach this quarter. She will first discuss the long-term positioning of our business before she covers the quarter's results and our outlook for the second half. As we look ahead to full year performance, we are increasing our expectation of core EPS growth to the high teens from our earlier expectation of mid- to high teens. This reflects both our robust first half and several other compelling factors. First, a larger portion of our revenue and profits is generated from businesses that have performed particularly well through downturns. Second, our cost structure is inherently variable. And as we've demonstrated during COVID, we've become increasingly adept at proactively cutting discretionary costs while continuing to thoughtfully invest in growth. Third, our balance sheet lets us aggressively deploy capital during down cycles through M&A, opportunistic investments in our REI businesses and continued share repurchases. Finally, macro uncertainty creates right conditions for market share gains. Occupiers and investors rely even more heavily on the insight, advice and global execution that CBRE is best positioned to deliver. Emma will now discuss all of this in greater detail. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thank you, Bob. Before I go through this quarter's results, I want to touch on what we've seen in the market since we last spoke in May, what it means for our business and why we remain confident in our outlook. Over the past 3 months, and as I'm sure you're all following closely, rates on the 10-year treasury rose as high as 3.5% before settling down to 2.8%. The uncertainty over how central banks might respond to inflation creates uneasiness in the market, more so in the public market, but also in the private commercial real estate market. Against that backdrop and what it means for CBRE, it's best to think about our business in 2 parts. The first part includes business lines that grow consistently throughout an economic cycle and have low sensitivity to market uncertainty. This includes our outsourcing business, GWS and as well as valuation, property management, loan servicing and significant components of our Investment Management and Development businesses. Our GWS business can directly benefit from economic uncertainty as occupiers outsource their real estate management to CBRE to reduce their costs. These businesses have become significantly more important to CBRE's overall financial performance. The second part of CBRE's business is more transactional in nature, capital markets, leasing and parts of our development and investment management businesses. These are sensitive to market uncertainty in the short term. But short term is not the right time frame to measure the resiliency of this part of our business. Slide 6 illustrates my point. COVID-19 created enormous market uncertainty during 2020, much more so than we're seeing today. And as a result, the transactional parts of our business saw total net revenue declined by 26% for the 12 months through the first quarter of 2021 versus the prior 12-month period. What's important and what I think is underappreciated is that these transactions didn't disappear, they paused. When market uncertainty lifted, these transactions came back, resulting in a powerful recovery. The net revenue growth of these businesses outpaced the S&P 500 over the period starting pre-COVID through the recovery of the following year. When our management team thinks about market uneasiness and what it means for CBRE, we focus on things we can control, first, costs; and second, capital deployment. One of the biggest drivers of CBRE's financial resiliency that we believe is underappreciated is the overall flexibility of our cost structure, which Slide 7 summarizes. Just over 40% of our cost structure is passed through to clients. These costs are tied one-to-one with revenue, which is why we exclude them when discussing net revenue. Another 44% is attributable to cost of revenue. These costs are variable. For example, during COVID in 2020, we saw net revenue in our advisory segment declined by 16.5%, while our cost of revenue decreased 16.7%. The remaining cost is OpEx. Of this, about 1/3 can be reduced at a rate faster than revenue declines. These costs include travel, business promotion and compensation tied to financial performance. The remaining 2/3 of OpEx is more difficult to move in the very short term, but reductions are certainly possible over a 1- to 2-year time frame. In summary, nearly 90% of CBRE's total cost are either directly tied to revenue or a highly flexible in nature. CBRE has had a track record of moving aggressively, with targeted cost reductions when market conditions soften. We have invested in leadership, processes and systems to enable these reductions, and we now consider it a core competency. Today, we are already taking steps to limit new hires, eliminate nonclient-related travel and entertainment and reduce other discretionary expenditures. And we are prepared to go further if we decide more reductions are needed. While achieving these cost efficiencies we will continue to make very targeted organic investments into areas where we expect a high return. We will also be investing our balance sheet. On Slide 8, you'll see that CBRE repurchased $1 billion of shares through the second quarter. Since the end of the second quarter, we have purchased another $77 million. We believe this represents the highest and best use of capital for our shareholders in the current environment. We would not be able to purchase a company near the quality of CBRE at the valuation we currently see for our shares. As a result, while we continue to build an M&A pipeline, share repurchases are likely to represent the most significant use of our capital for the balance of the year. We will be able to make these investments while maintaining CBRE's strong balance sheet, which ended Q2 with 0.2x net leverage and $4.2 billion of liquidity. Before tying all of this together with our qualitative outlook for the full year, let's first discuss second quarter performance for our 3 business segments and what we're seeing in each segment's business pipeline. Slide 10 summarizes results in our Advisory segment, which were driven by a 17% increase in property sales revenue and a 40% increase in leasing revenue. Performance is strongest in the Americas, due to improved market fundamentals, with sales and leasing increasing 26% and 56%, respectively. Outside of the Americas, sales revenue was flat and leasing rose by 5%, as FX reduced growth by 10 percentage points for each. Both U.S. leasing and sales grew in every month of the second quarter, though we did see some deceleration in June. Preliminary results for July show U.S. leasing and sales revenue, together, essentially flat, with a strong level of activity seen in July 2021. Our commercial mortgage origination revenue slipped 1% during the quarter. The government-sponsored enterprises, which are an important part of this business, continue to lose market share in the second quarter against strong competition from private lenders. The GSEs act as a moderating force in the multifamily lending market, and it's reasonable to expect our debt business to underperform property sales when the market is strong. The flip side is that our debt business should outperform property sales if the market is soft for the balance of the year. This is similar to the dynamic we saw in 2020. Our Advisory SOP margin and net revenue declined by 1.5 percentage points versus the record second quarter margin of last year. Approximately 1/3 of this decline can be attributed to lower OMSRs, $35 million this quarter, versus $42 million in Q2 last year. The remainder of the margin decline is mostly attributable to more brokers hitting higher commission payout thresholds, driven by the strong revenue growth. Our pipelines give us visibility into our transactional businesses over the next few months. The sales pipeline is up slightly versus last year's record Q3, though transactions are taking longer to close and debt markets have become less accommodating due to market uncertainty. Our updated guidance anticipates a lower level of sales activity in the back half of the year compared against second half 2021 record levels. Our leasing pipeline is essentially flat with the very strong pipeline we had at this time last year. We continue to see healthy activity across property types, with office being an outperformer. Office is growing from pent-up demand against the relatively low base of activity and higher-than-normal lease expirations. And we're expecting more leases to expire over the next 18 months than in any 18-month period over the last five years. Turning to Slide 11, within our GWS business. Total net revenue growth of 27% and SOP growth of 28% was aided by continued strong performance from Turner & Townsend. Excluding the contribution from Turner & Townsend, GWS net revenue increased by 8% or 12% in local currency, and SOP rose by 5% or 10% in local currency. Turner & Townsend performance reflects continued growth from their prior year results, in line with our expectations. Both facilities management and project management net revenue grew by double digits in local currency during the quarter. Growth was broad-based by client type and supported by a mix of new wins and expansions. GWS achieved a record high $1 billion of deal closing in the quarter. As a result of these wins, the pipeline fell sequentially, but is expected to end in 2022 with a meaningfully larger pipeline than year-end 2021. CBRE's competitive differentiation with the occupier outsourcing market has never been stronger. Slide 12 summarizes results in our REI segment, which performed very well in Q2. Development was a big catalyst, with SOP growth of $96 million versus last year's Q2, as we monetized several large assets and land parcels. We've benefited from investor preference for the types of properties we build, high-quality, build-to-core, typically well-leased assets in markets with good supply-demand fundamentals. Investment Management contributed $58 million of SOP, up $13 million over last year's Q2. AUM hit another record, up slightly versus Q1 despite over $4 billion of FX headwinds. Looking forward for investment management with more than 90% of our AUM in core or core plus strategies, we expect healthy performance to continue despite market uncertainty. Looking forward for our development business, over 3/4 of our in-process activity is industrial, multifamily or life sciences products, and we expect continued outperformance over time amid of flight to quality trend. Cap rate expansion is a headwind. Market-wide, cap rates have moved out by about 50 to 75 basis points on average. Against this backdrop, development activity may be delayed during periods of uncertainty, but we will monetize our developments, which are highly sought after in their respective markets and are favorably financed, giving CBRE and our capital partners the flexibility to time the market for sales. Our in-process portfolio, totaling $19.3 billion, provides visibility into future development profits. As we've noted before, we expect 1% to 2% of our end process portfolio to convert to SOP over a 12-month period. A modest recession could cause SOP to fall to the low end of that range, and a softer market creates opportunities to secure land sites that drive future profits. Slide 13 summarizes our outlook. Within Advisory, we expect investment sales and, to a lesser degree, leasing to decline in the back half of the year against the very strong 2021. We continue to expect leasing and property sales growth for full year 2022, supported by the strong first half. In GWS, our record wins in Q2 should help to drive over 20% SOP growth for the back half of the year, supported by 10% organic growth in local currency and Turner & Townsend continued strong contributions. In REI, we've already realized around 3/4 of the SOP we expect for the full year, including over 80% of our expected development SOP. So even in a more challenging macro environment, full year development profit will well exceed our initial expectations. In summary, and as Bob noted earlier, we now expect CBRE to achieve total core EPS growth in the high teens for the full year. Our core EPS guidance takes into account both the impact of FX and the lower share count. Absent the impact of FX, both realized year-to-date and expected, our core EPS growth expectations would be 4% to 5% higher. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Our first question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: My first question relates to how you're thinking about the second half of the year, and you discussed sales and leasing being down. But I was wondering if you can give us some sense as to how you think about the effect of a potential recession on those revenues and what you think of as kind of base cases, in your mind, as to what drawdowns could look like?\nEmma Giamartino: Absolutely. So I think what's important to note is when we're looking at the second half of the year, our baseline does assume that we enter into a recession in Q4, and we have somewhat of a slowdown in Q3. So our baseline for the next year is that we'll be in a mild recession. Inflation will start to moderate towards the second half of the year and interest rates will peak early next year and will rebound in the second half of 2023. So that's our baseline. Of course, there's upside from there. If we're wrong about what's going to play out in -- with the mild recession and the recession is not as significant as we're expecting, and then there's downside if the recession is more severe. But our guidance, as Bob and I both mentioned, is to high-teens core EPS growth for the full year. Without the impact of FX, that's in the low 20% EPS growth for the full year, which I think is a really positive outcome for our business. Across the three segments, what we're expecting is within Advisory, with the impact of sales and leasing, SOP should be down on a local currency basis in the mid-single digits. GWS, on a local currency basis for the second half of the year, will grow 25% and have a really strong second half. And then as we talked about with REI, we've monetized over 75% of our profits in the first half of the year. So we feel very confident about what's going to happen in the second half.\nAnthony Paolone: Got it. And then on the buyback, you have free cash flow, but you're also below target leverage that you laid out. So I mean, when you think about continuing to do the buyback, is it about utilizing free cash flow? Or would you also be willing to move up closer to your target leverage?\nEmma Giamartino: So our capital deployment strategy is unchanged. We continue to seek to reach our target of a turn of leverage, and we'll go up to a turn of leverage when we see an opportunity to continue with our buybacks at an attractive price. We are always prioritizing M&A, but right now, what we're seeing is that there's still a large bid-ask spread in terms of valuations. So we're building our M&A pipeline, as I mentioned in my remarks. And over the next year, especially if a recession continues, we expect to see opportunity as an M&A arise. And so we're balancing what we see in M&A with buybacks. And what you can expect for the balance of this year is that we'll continue to aggressively deploy our capital towards buybacks as long as our price remains attractive. And in a base case, I think a safe assumption is that we will do another $0.5 billion of buybacks in the second half of the year, but it could easily exceed that.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just if I could sneak one last one in here. On GWS, when you noted the $1 billion of contracts that you signed up in the quarter. Should we think about that as just take a 10%-ish margin and this basically adds $100 million of SOP to GWS? Or I mean, is that how we should think about it?\nEmma Giamartino: So those contracts are primarily in our enterprise FM business. We don't disclose what the margin is on those contracts just for competitive reasons. But I think it's safe to assume that those will come in, in the latter half of the year. Those -- a lot of those contracts have not yet been onboarded since they just closed in this quarter, so there will be a positive impact in the back half of the year. But I think you can use our guidance around SOP growth to help you with what the margins on that business will be.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nChandni Luthra: So I'd like to talk about advisory sales. We heard from public REITs across asset classes last week that asset values have come in anywhere from 5% to 15%, 20%, and yet we've seen investors basically just undertake more price discovery and continue to sit on the sidelines. So how much more do prices need to come down for transactions to pick base again? And what else is needed to get that clarity around transactions?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Chandni, it's not so much pricing as it is more certainty around where the economy is going to head, and also debt rates, what's going on with inflation and debt rates sorting out, I don't think most of the people going to the sidelines is being driven by the fact that they think asset prices are too expensive. The bottom line is in the 2 asset classes that are most attractive and most -- being most actively traded, industrial and multifamily, fundamentals are very strong. Rental rates are going up and the values are there as long as there's some clarity around where the economy is headed and where interest rates are headed.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. And switching gears to office lease -- office leasing for a second. So you talked about basically a record number of leases coming due in the next 12 to 18 months. But then how do we juxtapose that with the reality of a tougher economic outlook ahead, in which corporates might think about downsizing their office requirements? And how do you think about that balance? And what sort of -- what gives you confidence around office leasing as we move forward from here?\nRobert Sulentic: Well, we baked into our thinking for the balance of this year and for next year and beyond, the notion that corporates are, in general, going to consolidate to a degree their use of office space. There's some good news and bad news for us in that. If there's less office space leased, we'll lease less office space ourselves on behalf of our clients, but we'll also do more project management work. The fact of the matter is though almost all corporates are going to take a significant amount of space. And there is a large backlog of renewals that need to be dealt with, and they are -- those renewals are going to get executed or they're going to move into new buildings. And so it's a factor of that huge volume of renewals coming even if the space they take is somewhat smaller than it was before that gives us confidence to talk about the numbers the way we did.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: I just want to be very clear, Emma in -- I guess, on leasing and sales. It's pretty clear that I think sales activity is going to be negative on a year-over-year basis in the second half. I'm just trying to figure out, are you saying that you think leasing will also be negative? Or -- I'm just trying to read the wording. Are you saying, combined, those 2 are negative and leasing might be slightly positive, but sales is definitely negative?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. I can give you more color on that. So on the sales front, we're expecting -- and this is all in local currency, that we expect that in the second half to be down around 10%. And most of that decline, based on what we're seeing in our pipelines, we're expecting that to weigh -- the declines to weigh heavily in Q4. We have decent visibility into Q3, and so that should be flat to up. And then on the leasing side, we expect to decline but to a much lesser extent. So that should be in the low single-digit decline range in the second half of the year on a local currency basis, which I think is a big deal and very positive. And again, with leasing the same cadence we're expecting in Q3 and Q4. Based on our pipeline, Q3 should be flattish and Q4 is where you'll see the bulk of those declines.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to circle back maybe on the development profits. It obviously it sounds like you've got a lot of the full year in the bag, so to speak, given what you've done for 6 months. But maybe just talk about kind of the movement in cap rates and kind of the spread from where you were building to kind of where you're selling and just sort of the risks around that, maybe into the back half of the year and maybe as you think into next year?\nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Steve, the cap rates have moved, as we noted, 50 to 100 basis points, but they haven't moved any more rapidly than rents have moved. Rents have moved up significantly for both. Again, I'm going to tilt my comments toward industrial and multifamily, rents have moved up mid teams in multifamily and mid- to upper single digits in industrial, and that's allowed us to deal with the movement in cap rates and allowed us to deal with the movement in costs and protect our profitability. As things go forward, one of the very, very positive circumstances about our development business is that it's very high quality, very well-located, build-to-core product that's financed patiently with great external capital partners and we can decide when to harvest those projects within any rational time frame, such that we can optimize across the -- where rents are, where cap rates are, etcetera. So as Emma said in her prepared remarks, those assets that we have, that $19 billion of in-process development, will harvest. And it will harvest at a time that's relatively opportune because of the flexibility we have and the way we've capitalized those assets.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. I guess just a follow-up. I guess given the commentary around the uncertainty, right, people like those asset classes, but the debt markets have been probably more challenging and that's probably the bigger issue. So do we need to see like an improvement in the CMBS market or bank lending? I think people have confidence in industrial and apartments, but the financing markets are more gummed up today. So I guess...\nRobert Sulentic: I think people need to see stability and they need to have some clarity about where things are headed in the future. There is a lot of capital queued up out there to buy those asset classes and there are a lot of well-leased, well-located assets that can be sold. So by the way, we're not the only one on the development side that has the model that I just described that builds very good build-to-core assets that are well capitalized in terms of being patient. Much different than in prior cycles. The industry has moved forward. The industry has matured, become more enlightened about how to capitalize its development. And so I think people are looking for certainty and where cap rates are going to be, where inflation is going to be that drives interest rates, et cetera. And that's when you will see some of the slowdown in sales that we've described turn the other direction.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nJade Rahmani: On the M&A side, how would you prioritize areas of business that you're looking to expand in? Is it spread evenly across the board? Or do you see an outsized area to grow? And last quarter, I think I asked about infrastructure, I'm curious if that is a priority. I know you have some existing footprint there, but how big a priority is expanding infrastructure?\nRobert Sulentic: Jade, we look across our entire business, all 3 segments of our business, and we look across lines of business and the geographies within the segments. I will say that we tilt toward a few things. We definitely are looking for businesses that enhance our capability to serve our clients. We have increasingly large amounts of business with clients that ask us to do things around the world across lines of business, et cetera. And wherever we can fill in a capability that we don't have or that we think could be better, we target that area for M&A, because we know we have the clients there to do the work for. Secondly, we really are focused on this notion of driving our capital and our resources into areas of secular benefit, into areas that are resilient, and so we are looking for M&A opportunities that match up with that. We have a very definite plan in the various parts of our business. We have areas we prioritize. And if you looked at our M&A pipeline, it would be very evident. We also have this notion of certain aspects of what we're doing in that regard, understandably are confidential, and we wouldn't want to talk about what we're targeting specifically. But that's broadly how we think about it.\nJade Rahmani: Second question is on the debt finance side. I know you mentioned that in a declining property sales environment, the debt business would perform better. But overall, is that an area of growth? I believe you recently bolstered the management of the team in commercial and multifamily finance, curious how big a priority growing the debt placement business is.\nEmma Giamartino: Jade, that's a very big priority for us, and it's a business that has performed incredibly well for us. This year, we're expecting our overall debt origination business to grow. And like you said, a large part of that is because of -- and grow in the back half of the year. And a large part of that is because of our exposure to the GSEs. So in the back half of the year, as we're expecting a recession and as property sales start to come down and private lending starts to pull back. We expect the GSEs will come back and accelerate and will benefit significantly from that. And so we are -- and as a part of -- it's not only our debt origination business, but also our loan servicing business. So building out that team, and we are very focused on continuing to grow that business. Because if you think about the parts of our business that we talked about as resilient, that's one of our businesses that can help drive growth and provide resiliency through the cycle.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Sulentic for closing remarks.\nRobert Sulentic: Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again in about 90 days.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Before I go through this quarter's results, I want to touch on what we've seen in the market since we last spoke in May, what it means for our business and why we remain confident in our outlook. Over the past 3 months, and as I'm sure you're all following closely, rates on the 10-year treasury rose as high as 3.5% before settling down to 2.8%. The uncertainty over how central banks might respond to inflation creates uneasiness in the market, more so in the public market, but also in the private commercial real estate market. Against that backdrop and what it means for CBRE, it's best to think about our business in 2 parts. The first part includes business lines that grow consistently throughout an economic cycle and have low sensitivity to market uncertainty. This includes our outsourcing business, GWS and as well as valuation, property management, loan servicing and significant components of our Investment Management and Development businesses. Our GWS business can directly benefit from economic uncertainty as occupiers outsource their real estate management to CBRE to reduce their costs. These businesses have become significantly more important to CBRE's overall financial performance. The second part of CBRE's business is more transactional in nature, capital markets, leasing and parts of our development and investment management businesses. These are sensitive to market uncertainty in the short term. But short term is not the right time frame to measure the resiliency of this part of our business. Slide 6 illustrates my point. COVID-19 created enormous market uncertainty during 2020, much more so than we're seeing today. And as a result, the transactional parts of our business saw total net revenue declined by 26% for the 12 months through the first quarter of 2021 versus the prior 12-month period. What's important and what I think is underappreciated is that these transactions didn't disappear, they paused. When market uncertainty lifted, these transactions came back, resulting in a powerful recovery.

When our management team thinks about market uneasiness and what it means for CBRE, we focus on things we can control, first, costs; and second, capital deployment. One of the biggest drivers of CBRE's financial resiliency that we believe is underappreciated is the overall flexibility of our cost structure, which Slide 7 summarizes. Just over 40% of our cost structure is passed through to clients. These costs are tied one-to-one with revenue, which is why we exclude them when discussing net revenue. Another 44% is attributable to cost of revenue. These costs are variable. For example, during COVID in 2020, we saw net revenue in our advisory segment declined by 16.5%, while our cost of revenue decreased 16.7%. The remaining cost is OpEx. Of this, about 1/3 can be reduced at a rate faster than revenue declines. These costs include travel, business promotion and compensation tied to financial performance. The remaining 2/3 of OpEx is more difficult to move in the very short term, but reductions are certainly possible over a 1- to 2-year time frame.

While achieving these cost efficiencies we will continue to make very targeted organic investments into areas where we expect a high return. We will also be investing our balance sheet. On Slide 8, you'll see that CBRE repurchased $1 billion of shares through the second quarter. Since the end of the second quarter, we have purchased another $77 million. We believe this represents the highest and best use of capital for our shareholders in the current environment. We would not be able to purchase a company near the quality of CBRE at the valuation we currently see for our shares. As a result, while we continue to build an M&A pipeline, share repurchases are likely to represent the most significant use of our capital for the balance of the year. We will be able to make these investments while maintaining CBRE's strong balance sheet, which ended Q2 with 0.2x net leverage and $4.2 billion of liquidity. Before tying all of this together with our qualitative outlook for the full year, let's first discuss second quarter performance for our 3 business segments and what we're seeing in each segment's business pipeline. Slide 10 summarizes results in our Advisory segment, which were driven by a 17% increase in property sales revenue and a 40% increase in leasing revenue. Performance is strongest in the Americas, due to improved market fundamentals, with sales and leasing increasing 26% and 56%, respectively.

The flip side is that our debt business should outperform property sales if the market is soft for the balance of the year. This is similar to the dynamic we saw in 2020. Our Advisory SOP margin and net revenue declined by 1.5 percentage points versus the record second quarter margin of last year. Approximately 1/3 of this decline can be attributed to lower OMSRs, $35 million this quarter, versus $42 million in Q2 last year. The remainder of the margin decline is mostly attributable to more brokers hitting higher commission payout thresholds, driven by the strong revenue growth. Our pipelines give us visibility into our transactional businesses over the next few months. The sales pipeline is up slightly versus last year's record Q3, though transactions are taking longer to close and debt markets have become less accommodating due to market uncertainty. Our updated guidance anticipates a lower level of sales activity in the back half of the year compared against second half 2021 record levels. Our leasing pipeline is essentially flat with the very strong pipeline we had at this time last year. We continue to see healthy activity across property types, with office being an outperformer. Office is growing from pent-up demand against the relatively low base of activity and higher-than-normal lease expirations. And we're expecting more leases to expire over the next 18 months than in any 18-month period over the last five years. Turning to Slide 11, within our GWS business. Total net revenue growth of 27% and SOP growth of 28% was aided by continued strong performance from Turner & Townsend. Excluding the contribution from Turner & Townsend, GWS net revenue increased by 8% or 12% in local currency, and SOP rose by 5% or 10% in local currency. Turner & Townsend performance reflects continued growth from their prior year results, in line with our expectations. Both facilities management and project management net revenue grew by double digits in local currency during the quarter. Growth was broad-based by client type and supported by a mix of new wins and expansions. GWS achieved a record high $1 billion of deal closing in the quarter. As a result of these wins, the pipeline fell sequentially, but is expected to end in 2022 with a meaningfully larger pipeline than year-end 2021. CBRE's competitive differentiation with the occupier outsourcing market has never been stronger. Slide 12 summarizes results in our REI segment, which performed very well in Q2. Development was a big catalyst, with SOP growth of $96 million versus last year's Q2, as we monetized several large assets and land parcels. We've benefited from investor preference for the types of properties we build, high-quality, build-to-core, typically well-leased assets in markets with good supply-demand fundamentals. Investment Management contributed $58 million of SOP, up $13 million over last year's Q2. AUM hit another record, up slightly versus Q1 despite over $4 billion of FX headwinds. Looking forward for investment management with more than 90% of our AUM in core or core plus strategies, we expect healthy performance to continue despite market uncertainty. Looking forward for our development business, over 3/4 of our in-process activity is industrial, multifamily or life sciences products, and we expect continued outperformance over time amid of flight to quality trend. Cap rate expansion is a headwind. Market-wide, cap rates have moved out by about 50 to 75 basis points on average. Against this backdrop, development activity may be delayed during periods of uncertainty, but we will monetize our developments, which are highly sought after in their respective markets and are favorably financed, giving CBRE and our capital partners the flexibility to time the market for sales. Our in-process portfolio, totaling $19.3 billion, provides visibility into future development profits. As we've noted before, we expect 1% to 2% of our end process portfolio to convert to SOP over a 12-month period. A modest recession could cause SOP to fall to the low end of that range, and a softer market creates opportunities to secure land sites that drive future profits. Slide 13 summarizes our outlook. Within Advisory, we expect investment sales and, to a lesser degree, leasing to decline in the back half of the year against the very strong 2021. We continue to expect leasing and property sales growth for full year 2022, supported by the strong first half. In GWS, our record wins in Q2 should help to drive over 20% SOP growth for the back half of the year, supported by 10% organic growth in local currency and Turner & Townsend continued strong contributions. In REI, we've already realized around 3/4 of the SOP we expect for the full year, including over 80% of our expected development SOP. So even in a more challenging macro environment, full year development profit will well exceed our initial expectations. In summary, and as Bob noted earlier, we now expect CBRE to achieve total core EPS growth in the high teens for the full year. Our core EPS guidance takes into account both the impact of FX and the lower share count. Absent the impact of FX, both realized year-to-date and expected, our core EPS growth expectations would be 4% to 5% higher. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Absolutely. So I think what's important to note is when we're looking at the second half of the year, our baseline does assume that we enter into a recession in Q4, and we have somewhat of a slowdown in Q3. So our baseline for the next year is that we'll be in a mild recession. Inflation will start to moderate towards the second half of the year and interest rates will peak early next year and will rebound in the second half of 2023. So that's our baseline. Of course, there's upside from there. If we're wrong about what's going to play out in -- with the mild recession and the recession is not as significant as we're expecting, and then there's downside if the recession is more severe. But our guidance, as Bob and I both mentioned, is to high-teens core EPS growth for the full year. Without the impact of FX, that's in the low 20% EPS growth for the full year, which I think is a really positive outcome for our business. Across the three segments, what we're expecting is within Advisory, with the impact of sales and leasing, SOP should be down on a local currency basis in the mid-single digits. GWS, on a local currency basis for the second half of the year, will grow 25% and have a really strong second half. And then as we talked about with REI, we've monetized over 75% of our profits in the first half of the year. So we feel very confident about what's going to happen in the second half. So our capital deployment strategy is unchanged. We continue to seek to reach our target of a turn of leverage, and we'll go up to a turn of leverage when we see an opportunity to continue with our buybacks at an attractive price. We are always prioritizing M&A, but right now, what we're seeing is that there's still a large bid-ask spread in terms of valuations. So we're building our M&A pipeline, as I mentioned in my remarks. And over the next year, especially if a recession continues, we expect to see opportunity as an M&A arise. And so we're balancing what we see in M&A with buybacks. And what you can expect for the balance of this year is that we'll continue to aggressively deploy our capital towards buybacks as long as our price remains attractive. And in a base case, I think a safe assumption is that we will do another $0.5 billion of buybacks in the second half of the year, but it could easily exceed that. So those contracts are primarily in our enterprise FM business. We don't disclose what the margin is on those contracts just for competitive reasons. But I think it's safe to assume that those will come in, in the latter half of the year. Those -- a lot of those contracts have not yet been onboarded since they just closed in this quarter, so there will be a positive impact in the back half of the year. But I think you can use our guidance around SOP growth to help you with what the margins on that business will be. Yes. I can give you more color on that. So on the sales front, we're expecting -- and this is all in local currency, that we expect that in the second half to be down around 10%. And most of that decline, based on what we're seeing in our pipelines, we're expecting that to weigh -- the declines to weigh heavily in Q4. We have decent visibility into Q3, and so that should be flat to up. And then on the leasing side, we expect to decline but to a much lesser extent. So that should be in the low single-digit decline range in the second half of the year on a local currency basis, which I think is a big deal and very positive. And again, with leasing the same cadence we're expecting in Q3 and Q4. Based on our pipeline, Q3 should be flattish and Q4 is where you'll see the bulk of those declines. Jade, that's a very big priority for us, and it's a business that has performed incredibly well for us. This year, we're expecting our overall debt origination business to grow. And like you said, a large part of that is because of -- and grow in the back half of the year. And a large part of that is because of our exposure to the GSEs. So in the back half of the year, as we're expecting a recession and as property sales start to come down and private lending starts to pull back. We expect the GSEs will come back and accelerate and will benefit significantly from that. And so we are -- and as a part of -- it's not only our debt origination business, but also our loan servicing business. So building out that team, and we are very focused on continuing to grow that business. Because if you think about the parts of our business that we talked about as resilient, that's one of our businesses that can help drive growth and provide resiliency through the cycle."

            "name": "Robert Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE had an outstanding second quarter with strength across our global businesses. All 3 business segments posted double-digit revenue and segment operating profit growth despite the significant currency headwinds that affected all U.S.-based global companies. Core EPS was the highest for any quarter in CBRE's history, up 37% and from last year's second quarter, and even slightly higher than last year's record fourth quarter. These results reflect the benefits of the diversification strategy we've described in detail on previous calls and an economic backdrop that was still generally supportive despite heightened macro concerns. Highlights for the quarter include a record level of new occupier outsourcing contracts; strong growth in project management, aided by Turner & Townsend, strong growth in leasing; and record real estate development profits. We ended the quarter with excellent new business pipelines across numerous lines of business, which Emma will review. We also repurchased more than $600 million worth of our own shares, the most ever in any quarter, bringing year-to-date share repurchases through July to nearly $1.1 billion. Given the uncertain macroeconomic environment, Emma's remarks will take a different approach this quarter. She will first discuss the long-term positioning of our business before she covers the quarter's results and our outlook for the second half. As we look ahead to full year performance, we are increasing our expectation of core EPS growth to the high teens from our earlier expectation of mid- to high teens. This reflects both our robust first half and several other compelling factors. First, a larger portion of our revenue and profits is generated from businesses that have performed particularly well through downturns. Second, our cost structure is inherently variable. And as we've demonstrated during COVID, we've become increasingly adept at proactively cutting discretionary costs while continuing to thoughtfully invest in growth. Third, our balance sheet lets us aggressively deploy capital during down cycles through M&A, opportunistic investments in our REI businesses and continued share repurchases. Finally, macro uncertainty creates right conditions for market share gains. Occupiers and investors rely even more heavily on the insight, advice and global execution that CBRE is best positioned to deliver. Emma will now discuss all of this in greater detail. Emma? Yes, Chandni, it's not so much pricing as it is more certainty around where the economy is going to head, and also debt rates, what's going on with inflation and debt rates sorting out, I don't think most of the people going to the sidelines is being driven by the fact that they think asset prices are too expensive. The bottom line is in the 2 asset classes that are most attractive and most -- being most actively traded, industrial and multifamily, fundamentals are very strong. Rental rates are going up and the values are there as long as there's some clarity around where the economy is headed and where interest rates are headed. Well, we baked into our thinking for the balance of this year and for next year and beyond, the notion that corporates are, in general, going to consolidate to a degree their use of office space. There's some good news and bad news for us in that. If there's less office space leased, we'll lease less office space ourselves on behalf of our clients, but we'll also do more project management work. The fact of the matter is though almost all corporates are going to take a significant amount of space. And there is a large backlog of renewals that need to be dealt with, and they are -- those renewals are going to get executed or they're going to move into new buildings. And so it's a factor of that huge volume of renewals coming even if the space they take is somewhat smaller than it was before that gives us confidence to talk about the numbers the way we did. Yes, Steve, the cap rates have moved, as we noted, 50 to 100 basis points, but they haven't moved any more rapidly than rents have moved. Rents have moved up significantly for both. Again, I'm going to tilt my comments toward industrial and multifamily, rents have moved up mid teams in multifamily and mid- to upper single digits in industrial, and that's allowed us to deal with the movement in cap rates and allowed us to deal with the movement in costs and protect our profitability. As things go forward, one of the very, very positive circumstances about our development business is that it's very high quality, very well-located, build-to-core product that's financed patiently with great external capital partners and we can decide when to harvest those projects within any rational time frame, such that we can optimize across the -- where rents are, where cap rates are, etcetera. So as Emma said in her prepared remarks, those assets that we have, that $19 billion of in-process development, will harvest. And it will harvest at a time that's relatively opportune because of the flexibility we have and the way we've capitalized those assets. I think people need to see stability and they need to have some clarity about where things are headed in the future. There is a lot of capital queued up out there to buy those asset classes and there are a lot of well-leased, well-located assets that can be sold. So by the way, we're not the only one on the development side that has the model that I just described that builds very good build-to-core assets that are well capitalized in terms of being patient. Much different than in prior cycles. The industry has moved forward. The industry has matured, become more enlightened about how to capitalize its development. And so I think people are looking for certainty and where cap rates are going to be, where inflation is going to be that drives interest rates, et cetera. And that's when you will see some of the slowdown in sales that we've described turn the other direction. Jade, we look across our entire business, all 3 segments of our business, and we look across lines of business and the geographies within the segments. I will say that we tilt toward a few things. We definitely are looking for businesses that enhance our capability to serve our clients. We have increasingly large amounts of business with clients that ask us to do things around the world across lines of business, et cetera. And wherever we can fill in a capability that we don't have or that we think could be better, we target that area for M&A, because we know we have the clients there to do the work for. Secondly, we really are focused on this notion of driving our capital and our resources into areas of secular benefit, into areas that are resilient, and so we are looking for M&A opportunities that match up with that. We have a very definite plan in the various parts of our business. We have areas we prioritize. And if you looked at our M&A pipeline, it would be very evident. We also have this notion of certain aspects of what we're doing in that regard, understandably are confidential, and we wouldn't want to talk about what we're targeting specifically. But that's broadly how we think about it. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you again in about 90 days."

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn this conference over to your host, Ms. Kristyn Farahmand, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Thank you. Ma'am you may begin your presentation.\nKristyn Farahmand: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we issued a press release announcing our financial results, which is posted on the Investor Relations page of our website, cbre.com, along with a presentation slide deck that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks as well as an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials.  Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that this presentation contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Examples of these statements include our expectations regarding CBRE's future growth prospects, including 2022 qualitative outlook, operations, market share, capital deployment strategy and share repurchases, financial performance, including net leverage, profitability, expenses, and effective tax rate, the business environment and the effect of the COVID pandemic and geo-political tension, the integration and performance of acquisitions and other transactions and any other statements regarding matters that are not historical fact. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update the information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and certain factors may affect us in the future and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our most recent annual and quarterly reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, respectively. We have provided reconciliations of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, core EPS, core EBITDA, net revenue and certain other non-GAAP financial measures included in our remark to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in the appendix of the presentation slide deck. Our agenda for this morning's call will be as follows Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO will briefly comment on first quarter highlights and the role that our four dimension diversification strategy and balance sheet are playing in driving our growth. Then Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial and Investment Officer will discuss the quarter in detail and our updated qualitative 2022 outlook. Then we'll open up the call for questions. Please note that we are now referring to core adjusted EPS as core EPS for simplicity purposes. Additionally, we are also reporting core EBITDA, which like core EPS is equivalent to adjusted EBITDA, but excludes the fair value adjustments related to non-core investments. Now please turn to Slide 6 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Kristyn. And good morning, everyone. The year has started out strong for CBRE with excellent momentum across all three business segments. Globally, net revenue increased more than 30% and GAAP EPS and core EPS were up 48% and 72% respectively in the first quarter. We saw strong property sales growth in virtually every corner of the world. Office and retail continued to rebound nicely from COVID suppressed levels and multifamily and industrial maintained strong momentum. The continued rebound in leasing velocity is also encouraging. Notably office leasing revenues surpassed one, 2019 levels in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Office activity in the U.S. improved significantly, but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the lag in U.S. office, overall global leasing revenue is 20% above the Q1 2019 peak. We achieved these strong revenue gains while keeping expense growth in check, which is a top priority for us. Our core EBITDA margin on net revenue improved 280 basis points over the prior year, quarter, notably discretionary expenses were 27% below first quarter, 2019 levels, while net revenue was up 42% versus the same period. We continue to execute a strategy to diversify our business both organically and through investment broadly, across, the four dimensions we've talked about regularly over the last couple years, asset types, lines of business, clients and geographies. Our performance for the quarter drives home how effectively this strategy is working. We saw continued gains from the purposeful investments we have been making in parts of our business that are benefiting from enduring growth trends. Examples include the industrial and multifamily asset classes, which we invest in and serve broadly. Our local facilities management and our project management lines of business, and several of our geographies, particularly North Asia, where we continue to see strong growth. Notably, Turner & Townsend continues to perform ahead of our expectations, both financially and operationally, and we are enthusiastic about the added dimensions they bring to global project management offering, particularly in infrastructure, natural resources and sustainability services. We generate significant cash that is being strategically deployed into growth areas of our business, while we are also returning cash to shareholders at an elevated clip. Year-to-date share repurchases have totaled $627 million. I'll close with the word about Ukraine, which I know is top of mind for many of you. In early March, we decided to exit most of our business in Russia while keeping some employees in that country to manage facilities for multinational clients, consistent with our contractual obligations. We are inspired by the Ukrainian people's brave resistance to Russia's unprovoked aggression. With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma, who will discuss the quarter and the outlook.\nEmma Giamartino : Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 8. CBRE began the year with our strongest ever financial performance for a first quarter. Consolidated results were supported by double digit revenue and segment operating profit growth in each of our three operating segments. As Bob noted GAAP EPS was up 48% to a $1.16, while core EPS froze 72% to a $1.39. GAAP EPS was $0.23 below core EPS, mostly due to the mark-to-market evaluation of our non-core investments, particularly our Altus Power stake. The change in Altus\u2019 valuation during the quarter, largely reversed the non-cash gain we realized in Q4, which we also excluded from our core earnings.  Corporate overhead grew approximately $23 million for Q1 2021, but fell $40 million compared with Q4 2021. We continue to expect overall corporate overhead to decline slightly from 2021 levels for the full year. Our results are ahead of our own expectations across revenue, margins, and earnings. We're excited about the strong start to the year and the momentum we're seeing across our business. Please turn Slide 9 for a deeper look at our Advisory segment. Advisory Services, net revenue reached their first quarter record of $2.2 billion up 32% from last year. Within capital markets, we continue to see strong sales activities with total sales revenue up 58% versus last year. Strong property sales growth was broad-based across all major geographies with Pacific, North Asia and the U.S. being particular standouts. We have yet to see a material impact from rising rates on property sales. Globally office, industrial, retail and multifamily sales all surpassed their prior first quarter peak levels. While office remains the largest asset class and is to prior peak levels, it comprised about 20% of property sales in the quarter versus nearly one-third in Q1 2019, reflecting the sizeable gains we've made across the other property types. Our mortgage origination revenue excluding OMSR gains rose over 22% compared to Q1 2021. Industrial and multifamily originations continue to lead activity across property types. Lending markets remained highly liquid during most of the quarter with private lenders continuing to increase volumes. Lower government agency originations reflected robust private lending activity for multifamily assets, which continued to create attractive terms for borrowers and reduced events for agency debt. Our OMSR gains declined $50 [ph] million from the first quarter of last year reflecting this shift from agency to private lenders. Leasing revenue eclipsed prior peak first quarter levels in all global regions. Global revenue was up over 48% in Q1 led by continental Europe and the U.S. Continuing recent trends industrial revenue rose strongly, while the omicron variant pose continued challenges, we were encouraged to see global office leasing improved significantly from last year's COVID suppress level and fall modestly short of the Q1 peak set in 2019. We expect that recovery for office leasing will continue to improve from the COVID depressed levels of 2021 as leases roll over and occupy upgrade their office space. 70% of our surveyed occupier clients are planning a hybrid approach for their office return, and over 90% of them are planning to either expand or contract their office footprints over the next three years. This is a clear positive for our office advisory business, as any changes in space requirements drives not only commission revenue, but often also workplace advisory and project management fees. Despite heightened macro risk from persistent inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions, U.S. sales and lease activity has remained strong since the end of Q1 with revenue up significantly over the prior year during April. Advisory services segment operating profits started the year stronger than expected, up 40% to $466 million with our net margin increasing to 20.9% from 19.7% in Q1 2021. Prudent operating expense management largely offset higher cost of sales due to deals being more heavily weighted to our highest producing brokers and the lower OMSR gains. Turning to GWS on Slide 10, net revenue grew over $400 million or 27%. Excluding Turner & Townsend net revenue rose nearly 9% overall with project management up 13% and facilities management up 7%. Our new business pipeline points to facilities management revenue accelerating significantly as the year progresses. As clients gain more visibility about their space utilization and less their need for outsourcing services. Our pipeline revenue is at a record level with a diversified mix of financial services, defense, automotive, retail and logistics prospects. Overall GWS segment operating profit grew 33% or over 6% organically. Margins on net revenue grew to 10.9% in Q1 benefiting from the Turner & Townsend acquisition. After this acquisition net margins declined very slightly from prior year in line with our expectations. We expect a slight margin pressure to subside toward the end of the year. Turning to Slide 11, our REI segment posted another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 34% to $284 million and segment operating profit grew to $167 million, up $104 million versus Q1 of last year which was modestly better than our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our development business continued to post excellent results benefiting from a strong pipeline and compressed cap rates. Development contributed nearly $107 million of segment operating profit in the first quarter, up from $10 million in the prior year. We saw multiple large co-investment asset sales in the first quarter notably in Industrial and Multifamily. Looking ahead, development operating profit is expected to be weighted to the first half of the year. However, any movement of development asset sales between periods, which is common in this business could impact the quarterly cadence of our results. Our development pipeline rose to more than $10 billion, and in-process portfolio reached almost $20 billion, both record levels. This gives us visibility into strong, long-term development operating profit growth. Historically we've converted about 1% to 2% of our in-process portfolio into operating profit annually. Our development business is also strategically well placed with industrial and multifamily comprise over three quarters of the combined pipeline, and in-process portfolio.  Fee development and build-to-suits make up more than 50% of in-process activity. Our investment management business also turned in a strong performance in Q1, while operating profit declined by $9 million versus same period last year. The decline was due to a one-time $24 million accounting methodology driven gain we booked in last year's Q1 and called out at the time. Absent this gain operating profit improved about 33% supported by co-investment returns, which benefited from appreciating asset values. Investment management AUM reached a new record of nearly $147 billion with logistics and infrastructure climbing by 9% and 7% respectively over the quarter. AUM growth was driven by $4 billion of net capital inflows as well as higher property valuations only partially offset by unfavorable FX rates. We've also continued to benefit from the partnership between our investment management and development businesses, which has supported AUM growth for investment management and pipeline growth for our develop business. Turning to Slide 12 CBRE repurchased more than $390 million of shares in the first quarter, a record amount. As Bob mentioned, year-to-date through May 3rd we repurchase nearly 7 million shares for $627 million. We anticipate maintaining a significant pace of are repurchases for the balance of the year, absent, substantial and compelling M&A opportunities. We also remain committed to maintaining a durable balance sheet. Net leverage was just under 0.1 turns at the end of Q1, well below the midpoint of our zero to 2 times target range. This is despite the share purchases, seasonally higher use of cash for employee incentive compensation in this seasonally light revenue and earnings typical of our first quarter. Absent any substantial M&A opportunities we anticipate remaining below 1-turn at the end of 2022, even allowing for an elevated pace of share repurchases. Turning to Slide 13, as we look ahead, we have the same expectation for achieving mid-to-high teams consolidated core earnings growth for the full year that we provided at the end of February. Our business today continues to have strong momentum. Our base of contractual work in project management, facilities management and investment management is large and growing rapidly and lease and sales transaction activity through April remains robust. Commercial real estate markets also are healthy with office, retail and multifamily fundamentals improving and industrial fundamentals remaining strong in core markets. Materially offsetting these continued positive trends, the broad economic backdrop has softened and interest rates have risen since we've provided our earnings outlook in late February. We have taken some of these dynamics into consideration in reaffirming our full year expectations. Specifically should an economic downturn emerge we expect the more resilient and secularly favored parts of our business to help offset any potential weakening and other parts of our business. In particular, we have noted that office leasing is benefiting from strong tailwinds that we expect to sustain for some period of time. Additionally, we have identified cost measures, we can implement quickly should market conditions warrant. On the other hand, if the macro environment remains supportive for the rest of the year, there could be upside to our current expectations. Additionally, our outlook does not include any benefit from incremental M&A activity or share repurchases. We expected to be active capital allocators for the rest of the year and would be positioned to move aggressively in a weaker economic environment. We look forward to updating you when we report second quarter results in July. With that operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Bob, Emma could you talk about what are you both seeing on M&A front? I mean, you've obviously talked about heightened macro volatility, but in a tougher environment do you think there is potential for more M&A opportunities? And then could you give us some insight into how the pipeline is looking right now and how do you think about M&A considerations multiples in this environment?\nBob Sulentic: Chandni, I'm going to comment and then I'm going to ask Emma to do the same. I want to remind everybody that in addition to being our CFO, Emma oversees our M&A activities. So she's got great insight into this. But I want to start with the notion that M&A is a core competency of our company and we expect our leaders around the world to identify M&A opportunities that help us add to the capability we can offer to our clients. We're also increasingly focused on driving capital and resources into areas of our business with secular benefit and we're really well positioned to do that because we have such a strong base of operations across the four dimensions we talk about; product type, service type, client type, and geography. Prices have been high recently, which means that we've been a little bit careful about what we might queue up for acquisition. We think if the environment slows a bit, gets a little tougher because of inflation or a recession that might be ahead of us that our opportunity to invest will grow. But we are looking across our business for two types of acquisitions, and I'm being redundant here, but I want to say it again. Acquisitions that add to our capability to serve our clients and acquisitions that drive diversification across our business and we have a good pipeline of both types of candidates. I also want to say that we're looking at things that we haven't looked at traditionally that we think are a really good fit for our business. One of the best examples I can give you recently, of course is Turner & Townsend which was a very unique acquisition for us and the early returns on it were about as good as I've ever seen us have on a big acquisition. So with that I'm going to ask you to add to that, Emma.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. I would just add that our pipeline is really strong for M&A, so we're building it for the rest of this year and 2023 and beyond so that we can really be ready when we believe valuations will come down and we can be aggressive in taking advantage of that opportunity. And then I will also add that I said this in my remarks but it's important to reiterate that our outlook does not include any this M&A this year or incremental buyback. So all of that should be upside to our outlook this year, and that stands for 2023 and beyond. Our long-term outlook does not include material capital allocation.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. And switching gears to kind of two asset classes that have been doing really well, Multifamily and Industrial. I mean, we've heard from a lot of public reads over the course of last week and a half. And most of them talked about seeing a pause in transaction activity, citing large leveraged buyers pulling out. And then we've also more recently heard from Amazon talking about excess capacity in warehousing \u2013 industrial warehousing. So what are you seeing on that front? I know it's been very strong for you, but do you think activity in these asset classes slow ahead. I mean, do you see these as early signs? What do you think rates are doing here?\nBob Sulentic: Well, that's a multi-layered question, Chandni. There's a lot of focus on cap rates. There's a lot of focus on the cost of debt, but when you look at the trading of assets and the value of assets you also have to look at fundamentals and you also have to look at the amount of capital that's out there pursuing those assets. Fundamentals are exceptionally strong. I think historically strong in the multifamily asset class. Vacancy is as low as it's been in 20 years. The amount of pent-up demand relative to the amount of vacancy is also as low as it's been in 20 years. There's upward pressure on rents and there's more renters out there in the market than there is new product coming online. So that bodes well for the value of those assets. The other thing that I think gets missed a little bit by people and it's sometimes cited as a problem for our sector, which it is a challenge, and that is what's going on with the cost of assets. The cost of assets is going up. Construction cost is going up. Fundamentals have allowed rental rates to make up for that and the value of assets, but when you think about \u2013 how investors think about product, one of the things they always consider is replacement cost. Anybody that comes into the market today and buys assets can have a decent level of confidence that replacement cost is going to be above what they pay for those assets, so that's positive dynamic. And it's not as extreme with the industrial asset class as it is with the multifamily asset class, but when you go into core markets around the U.S. the big gateway markets and the most important secondary markets. And when you look at modern large industrial assets which is where we play primarily, the fundamentals there are extremely strong as well. So I was meeting with one of the most active players in the New York \u2013 New Jersey industrial market yesterday and their comment was it's sold out, right? There's not available space up there. And the Amazon news is important. They've been the biggest \u2013 the biggest leaser in across the U.S. the last couple years, I will tell you that Amazon their percentage of the market slowed down in the last 12 months by over half what it was in 2020 and the fundamentals haven't really changed. There's strong, strong demand for any space that exists out there. So we're relatively bullish about what's going to happen with values for both multifamily and industrial assets at the same time we're very aware that if there is a recession, if [indiscernible] do take up, if debt becomes more expensive which it will, there could be a period of time when the buyers and sellers go to the sideline, and that's baked into our thoughts about where we're headed for this year and next year.\nChandni Luthra: Thanks Bob for all that color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes. Thanks. Good morning Bob and Emma. I just kind of wanted to circle back to some of the comments that you both made. You basically had a great first quarter. You're keeping guidance unchanged at this point? You said April was off to a very good starter or April was a good start to the quarter. And I guess I'm just trying to sort of weave all that into your comments, kind of about potential upside. I guess the way I'm reading it is, there probably is upside to numbers but just the uncertainty on the macro is kind of keeping you from raising guidance at this point. Is that really the simple message?\nEmma Giamartino: So, yes, I think that [indiscernible] well, but to put some more color around that, and to be clear, if we weren't seeing pressures from the macro environment we would be increasing outlook. And so we've spent a lot of time sensitizing what we think is going to happen through the second half of the year. And there are a number of factors that are giving us confidence that will \u2013 that we'll deliver the outlook that we expected to in February. Like you said in Q1 has been really strong. Our pipelines for Q2 and our transaction business are very strong, we are anticipating if interest rates rises as expected there will be slowdowns in parts of our business in the second half of the year, which will be offset by our secularly favorite parts of our business. And again, I want to remind everyone that capital allocation is not included in our outlook, so that will be upside. And then I also want to mention that in my remarks, I talked about the cost levers that we have in place. So if things turn in a different direction then we're expecting, and there is more pressure. We have cost levers that we know we can pull, and we've proven that we can pull through 2020 and 2021. So that gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in 2022. And then we also look towards 2023, because we know everyone's really thinking about what's going to happen if interest rates continue to rise. And we ran some sensitivities around what we expect next year and everything that we said about 2022 really holds for 2023. We have \u2013 we are more contractual. We have more recurring revenue than we've ever had before. We've invested in growing in our \u2013 in secularly favorite areas. And we believe those parts of our business are really going to offset areas where we'll see pressure like capital markets and potentially in development. So we feel very positively about where we're going to go in 2022 and 2023, and think there is upside to what we're talking about.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then I guess just trying to think about the capital allocation. So it sounds like acquisitions at this point are, I don't want to put words in your mouth kind of maybe on hold but you're certainly willing to deploy a lot more capital in the share of buybacks. Can you just maybe kind of walk us through the math and how you're thinking about that? It was nice to see the acceleration in Q1 and into the early part of Q2. But it sounds like buybacks could be materially higher than we originally thought?\nEmma Giamartino: So the capital allocation strategy that we've talked about over the past few quarters remains unchanged. We are prioritizing accretive strategic M&A when we see opportunities arise and we're very focused on building that pipeline, and executing on those opportunities. But valuations are high and so it's really important that we're patient. We want to make sure that we're delivering returns that are well above the returns we can deliver through buybacks. But we always said we would balance that with buybacks when we don't see a huge opportunity for transformational M&A within a year. And so that's what we've done. We've seen a value opportunity. Our price has been very attractive. So as long as that continues we will continue to buy back shares through the rest of the year.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, thank you. Just Emma, I guess just one more thing on the guidance that I had on my mind last quarter, you had given some pretty specific brackets around Advisory, GWS and REI. Did anything change within those, like some of your expectations for lease and sales revenue and so forth?\nEmma Giamartino: So, we're making a shift, as you can see in this quarter to really focus on our consolidated performance, because we are a more mature, diversified business where we have multiple levers. And one single factor we don't believe should impact our long-term or even near-term growth trajectory. So, I'm not going to comment on specific parts of our business, but as both Bob and I've talked about where we potentially see a slowdown in the second half of the year is primarily in capital markets. And then I do want to comment on development. I mentioned this in my remarks and we mentioned it last quarter, but simply because of timing, the majority of our development profits are going to hit in the first half of this year. It doesn't have anything to do with the external environment. It's simply when these projects are expected to be completed. And if you look at those profits on an annual basis, I think, that's the best way to look at the sustainability and the stability of those profits. We've said that about 1% to 2% of our in process portfolio typically converts to SOP in any given 12-month period. Right now we're slightly ahead of that, but if you extrapolate that to 2023 and expect that profit to move more in the 1% to 2% range, that can give you an idea of the sustainability and stability of our development pipeline.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks for that. And then with regards to EBITDA margins, can you talk about any puts or takes on that side? Because if you think about the last year business kind of accelerated, and you had a lot of costs that had been taken out during the pandemic and still a lot of deals being done over Zoom and stuff, but now it seems like maybe the business is slowing and people are getting back to face-to-face. Are there any parts of the business where there's margin pressure or deals less profitable or any other places where you're making up ground?\nEmma Giamartino: So the only place where we're seeing costs come back, which we anticipated and talked about in Q4 is within our GWS business. And that\u2019s just our reversion to pre-pandemic levels. During the pandemic, we were servicing facilities and buildings, although people weren't going to disabilities and office buildings. And so the cost to service those buildings declined in an unusual way. So we\u2019re going back, we\u2019re reverting to normal with in our GWS business. And we\u2019re seeing some margin pressure this quarter. We expect that to like to mediate throughout this year.  So margins within a legacy GWS business is slight tick up through the remainder of the year. But in the rest of our business, we\u2019re actually seeing within advisory you\u2019re seeing stronger margins than we expected and so that\u2019s evidence of our ability to control our cost all of the cost measures we put in place. Bob mentioned that our discretionary costs this quarter are down pretty meaningfully. And our hiring has flowed somewhat simply because of the challenge labor market. So we feel really good about our margins.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just last question you had made a comment about some of the lending moving away from the GSEs on the multifamily side, and I thought they raised their caps for 2022. So I was a little bit surprised by that. Can you just talk about what's happening there, how big a part of your overall mortgage business is GSE piece? And just what happens you think to that either the origination piece and/or servicing as rates move up?\nBob Sulentic: Tony, we think \u2013 well, first of all, that's a very big part of \u2013 GSE business is a very big part of our lending business. It's moved more to private lending in the last quarter, and the first quarter of this year. And we're watching to see what's going to play out for the rest of the year and next year, as it relates to mortgage servicing, which has become a big and very recurring, very contractual business for us. We expect that continue to grow partly from the business that we source, but also partly from business that we take on from others.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. I mean, just with the GSE part though, why do you think people are going to private lenders when they have, I guess, the ability to lend even more this year?\nEmma Giamartino: So, there's two factors. One, private capital has been very aggressive with their lending terms, so the GSEs are simply being outcompeted. And then the GSEs pulled back. If you think about Q1 of last year they needed to provide liquidity. And this quarter, because the markets have been flooded with liquidity, they didn't have that same that same need.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes to the line of Patrick OShaughnessy with Raymond James, you might proceed with your question.\nDavid Farnum: Hey, good morning. It's David Farnum on for Patrick. Wanted to ask a question on your EMEA business. How are market conditions holding up in that region as compared to the other geographies?\nBob Sulentic: Market conditions are really good in EMEA right now, I was just over there last week. I was over there for a Turner & Townsend Board meeting, which by the way that company is doing extremely well. And what we found out was across the UK and across Europe leasing is strong and coming back, the industrial asset class is holding up well, there's large amounts of capital to be invested in commercial and multifamily assets. Multifamilies are smaller business over there than it is over here. I would say the fundamentals across Europe right now are quite strong and our business is performing \u2013 our advisory business there is performing better than it's ever performed in the history of our company. So we're feeling really good about that business now.\nDavid Farnum: Great, thanks. And then maybe switching gears to the Turner & Townsend business for a moment, how about you've been working with that business for a few months now, what sort of integration has taken place between Turner & Townsend and the rest of the organization?\nBob Sulentic: Well, it's important to remember that we bought 60% of the business, 40% of business remains with the partners that the legacy partners in Turner & Townsend. We govern that company through a board of directors, three directors from CBRE three directors from Turner & Townsend. And the integration has largely been a revenue integration. We have not tried to seek cost synergies out of that deal. We have not tried to alter the way they go-to-market. The infrastructure that supports that business is our infrastructure, the way the integration is progressing is we're working with them to bring them into our client relationships as an added capability. We have some other resources that we're providing to them to help them grow their business, but it is not a traditional full on integration. The best comp for Turner & Townsend in our company would be the way we operate Trammell Crow Company, although we own a hundred percent of it, roughly 40% of the economics go to the developers. Trammell Crow Company has kept its brand. They've operated independently. They have a tremendous culture and they've grown tremendously. And we've modeled Turner & Townsend after that. They liked that model. They wanted that model. We\u2019re six months or so into the relationship. As I said, in my opening remarks, both financially and operationally it's proceeding better than we had thought it would proceed. And we were quite bullish about the investment when we made it. There is a bunch of stuff that Turner & Townsend would like to do, and we would like to do together with them that we haven't been able to get to yet simply. They're running at capacity and as they add capacity, that capacity is fully utilized. So, there's a good deal of upside associated with what might happen with Turner & Townsend and next year and beyond. And Emma kind of commented on that when she gave you that little snapshot of how we think 2023 might play out. We think there is some upside to Turner & Townsend because of the secularly benefited areas that they operate in.\nDavid Farnum: Excellent. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes to the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW, you may receive with your question.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. When you look at the size, and scale and footprint of the company overall, where do you see the greatest growth opportunities? You mentioned investing in new areas. I was wondering if infrastructure and potentially energy and renewables size to you as very strong growth potential, or would it be within the company's existing capabilities and footprint in core real estate services areas such as, for example, mortgage origination, where perhaps the ratio of property sales to mortgage could be a little bit reduced, more mortgage less property sales just as a ratio?\nBob Sulentic: There's a lot there in that question, Jade. Let me try to take the pieces off as you ask them. So first of all, with regard to energy/sustainability, we're embedding that in many of our services across the company. And it's not necessarily a separate profit line, but the capability in our facilities management and property management and project management and development businesses that brings sustainability to those product lines helps us grow those businesses. And then Turner & Townsend directly does things with regards to sustainability that are important product lines for them. Infrastructure, you're going to see growth in infrastructure through Turner & Townsend. You're going to see growth in infrastructure through our investment management business, and they've grown the AUM there very nicely. But when you look across our business, and again, I want to beat this drum because it's so important, we are really broadly diversified across product type, service type, client type and line of business. So where are we going to see growth across those four dimensions. The work we do for big technology companies around the world is going to continue to grow significantly. And it's likely not going to be all that subjected to economic downturns compared to some other things out there. Project management, with all that's going on with sustainability, with all that's going on with reorienting offices to the future way they'll be use, we think that there's going to be sustainable growth there. Ironically, when you look at what's happened to our business over the last two or three years during the COVID area \u2013 era, everybody knows that we faced secular headwinds in the office building part of our business, which is a big part of our business. What we now believe for at least the next two or three years, we're going to have real secular tailwinds with office as occupiers go back to renewing or changing the leases they have. We've got a very good insight into what that pipeline looks like as occupiers reconfigure their space, et cetera. We think we're going to actually benefit. At the same time, we might see some downward pressure from what's going on with interest rates and cap rates and the economy as a whole, we actually think office is going to come back in and provide some tailwinds for us. We're very, very encouraged about that. And then when you kind of get deeper into our business and look at those four dimensions, I'll give you an example of something that we haven't talked a lot about, we've mentioned it kind of in passing. But if you look at our advisory business, over the last few years I often get the question, what part of the world should that business grow the most. And well, it should grow the most in part of the world where the economy is growing the most and that continues to be Asia. If you went back five or six years, our advisory business in North Asia was probably no more than 1% to 2% of our business. It's likely to be 6% to 7% of our advisory business this year. Not that much of it in China because of what's going on in China, but Korea is really growing for us, Japan is really growing for us, Hong Kong is really growing for us. We have a nice business in Taiwan, and then we think eventually, China is going to kick in when things sort out now. So we've got pockets of opportunity for growth across those four dimensions. And that's why when Emma talks about what's going to go on the rest of this year and thinks about what might happen next year even if things get a little tough in the economy, even if we go into a mild recession, we're pretty encouraged about where we sit out there. And then, of course, in all of those areas, we have capital to drive into acquisitions if things slow down, and it's easier to buy some things than it is today.\nJade Rahmani: In terms of tone from investors, institutional investors looking to deploy capital into real estate, are you detecting any changes? And in terms of dry powder, does that at all come under pressure from lower equity markets because the allocations are set relative to their overall asset allocation strategy? So lower \u2013 equity markets have been a boon to real estate allocations, but now could be a headwind. How would you answer those two questions?\nBob Sulentic: And we do watch the denominator effect, and we're wondering if that's going to have an impact next year depending on what happens with equities. If those go down and then real estate holds up and becomes a bigger part of the portfolios that may put a little downward pressure on some institutions buying commercial assets. But I will tell you what we've seen around the world, around the world, is there is more capital for real estate than there is real estate for capital right now and that's equity capital and that's debt capital. And people really like the fundamentals and they believe in this asset class more and more for the long-term. There could be an interruption later this year, there could be an interruption next year, but the long-term trajectory is more institutional capital is being aimed at commercial real estate assets and institutional quality multifamily assets. And the base of assets around the world is growing. So we think that this is a really nice, long-term trend for our company in the sector we compete in.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you. And then just lastly on the GSE multifamily, one of the issues has been they underwrite on a trailing 12-month cash flow basis. And as I'm sure you all know, rents in multifamily have been skyrocketing and so debt funds and other more flexible lenders, they're looking forward. They're looking at forward NOI, putting the GSEs at a relative disadvantage. Do you see that gap alleviating considering that their caps are 11% higher than last year?\nEmma Giamartino: So we do see that alleviating somewhat as valuations increase and the GSEs come up to speed to where the private markets are. One of the factors that's impacting the GSEs is that they do have new leadership in place, so as they go through that transition and as the leadership comes into gain some \u2013 moves further into their term, we expect GSEs to pick up.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.\nStephen Sheldon: Hi. Thanks. Good morning and nice results here. Just one for me, and it's on the longer-term trend towards real estate ownership, I guess, shifting more towards institutions versus more or less private ownership. Do you think that trend has continued as we look back over the last few years? And if so, what has that meant in terms of both outsourcing adoption in GWS and the velocity of properties changing hands, given normally shorter holding periods? And could that trend make capital markets activity become slightly more recurring over time?\nBob Sulentic: There is a few things about that trend that are really important to our business. One is that institutions historically have tended to trade a bit more than non-institutional owners. So that's good. That adds to the velocity associated with our brokerage businesses, both brokerage of debt and brokerage of the assets themselves. Secondly, what's happening is these institutions that are controlling the assets are growing; they're getting bigger and bigger. And they tend to want to work with fewer and fewer service providers. We're a beneficiary of that. By the way, we're a big beneficiary of that with occupiers and we're a big beneficiary of that with investors. And one of the things we've done with our family is \u2013 not with our family, with our company is working incredibly hard to be connected across lines of business and geographies so that we can offer a product to these big institutions that invest in real estate and these big occupiers that use real estate, so that they feel like they can comfortably use us instead of a group of companies. That's been a really powerful trend for us. We expect it to consider or we expect it to continue. And so when you look at what you're describing, Stephen, for the institutional ownership of assets, we think it's going to be a positive secular driver in the growth of CBRE, and we think \u2013 and the same thing is going to happen with the occupiers, and it is happening.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Mr. Bob Sulentic for closing remarks.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you in three months when we report our second quarter earnings.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 8. CBRE began the year with our strongest ever financial performance for a first quarter. Consolidated results were supported by double digit revenue and segment operating profit growth in each of our three operating segments. As Bob noted GAAP EPS was up 48% to a $1.16, while core EPS froze 72% to a $1.39. GAAP EPS was $0.23 below core EPS, mostly due to the mark-to-market evaluation of our non-core investments, particularly our Altus Power stake. The change in Altus' valuation during the quarter, largely reversed the non-cash gain we realized in Q4, which we also excluded from our core earnings.  Corporate overhead grew approximately $23 million for Q1 2021, but fell $40 million compared with Q4 2021. We continue to expect overall corporate overhead to decline slightly from 2021 levels for the full year. Our results are ahead of our own expectations across revenue, margins, and earnings. We're excited about the strong start to the year and the momentum we're seeing across our business. Please turn Slide 9 for a deeper look at our Advisory segment. Advisory Services, net revenue reached their first quarter record of $2.2 billion up 32% from last year. Within capital markets, we continue to see strong sales activities with total sales revenue up 58% versus last year. Strong property sales growth was broad-based across all major geographies with Pacific, North Asia and the U.S. being particular standouts. We have yet to see a material impact from rising rates on property sales. Globally office, industrial, retail and multifamily sales all surpassed their prior first quarter peak levels. While office remains the largest asset class and is to prior peak levels, it comprised about 20% of property sales in the quarter versus nearly one-third in Q1 2019, reflecting the sizeable gains we've made across the other property types. Our mortgage origination revenue excluding OMSR gains rose over 22% compared to Q1 2021. Industrial and multifamily originations continue to lead activity across property types. Lending markets remained highly liquid during most of the quarter with private lenders continuing to increase volumes. Lower government agency originations reflected robust private lending activity for multifamily assets, which continued to create attractive terms for borrowers and reduced events for agency debt. Our OMSR gains declined $50 [ph] million from the first quarter of last year reflecting this shift from agency to private lenders. Leasing revenue eclipsed prior peak first quarter levels in all global regions. Global revenue was up over 48% in Q1 led by continental Europe and the U.S. Continuing recent trends industrial revenue rose strongly, while the omicron variant pose continued challenges, we were encouraged to see global office leasing improved significantly from last year's COVID suppress level and fall modestly short of the Q1 peak set in 2019. We expect that recovery for office leasing will continue to improve from the COVID depressed levels of 2021 as leases roll over and occupy upgrade their office space. 70% of our surveyed occupier clients are planning a hybrid approach for their office return, and over 90% of them are planning to either expand or contract their office footprints over the next three years. This is a clear positive for our office advisory business, as any changes in space requirements drives not only commission revenue, but often also workplace advisory and project management fees. Despite heightened macro risk from persistent inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions, U.S. sales and lease activity has remained strong since the end of Q1 with revenue up significantly over the prior year during April. Advisory services segment operating profits started the year stronger than expected, up 40% to $466 million with our net margin increasing to 20.9% from 19.7% in Q1 2021. Prudent operating expense management largely offset higher cost of sales due to deals being more heavily weighted to our highest producing brokers and the lower OMSR gains. Turning to GWS on Slide 10, net revenue grew over $400 million or 27%. Excluding Turner & Townsend net revenue rose nearly 9% overall with project management up 13% and facilities management up 7%. Our new business pipeline points to facilities management revenue accelerating significantly as the year progresses. As clients gain more visibility about their space utilization and less their need for outsourcing services. Our pipeline revenue is at a record level with a diversified mix of financial services, defense, automotive, retail and logistics prospects. Overall GWS segment operating profit grew 33% or over 6% organically. Margins on net revenue grew to 10.9% in Q1 benefiting from the Turner & Townsend acquisition. After this acquisition net margins declined very slightly from prior year in line with our expectations. We expect a slight margin pressure to subside toward the end of the year. Turning to Slide 11, our REI segment posted another outstanding quarter. Revenue increased 34% to $284 million and segment operating profit grew to $167 million, up $104 million versus Q1 of last year which was modestly better than our expectations at the beginning of the year. Our development business continued to post excellent results benefiting from a strong pipeline and compressed cap rates. Development contributed nearly $107 million of segment operating profit in the first quarter, up from $10 million in the prior year. We saw multiple large co-investment asset sales in the first quarter notably in Industrial and Multifamily. Looking ahead, development operating profit is expected to be weighted to the first half of the year. However, any movement of development asset sales between periods, which is common in this business could impact the quarterly cadence of our results. Our development pipeline rose to more than $10 billion, and in-process portfolio reached almost $20 billion, both record levels. This gives us visibility into strong, long-term development operating profit growth. Historically we've converted about 1% to 2% of our in-process portfolio into operating profit annually. Our development business is also strategically well placed with industrial and multifamily comprise over three quarters of the combined pipeline, and in-process portfolio.  Fee development and build-to-suits make up more than 50% of in-process activity. Our investment management business also turned in a strong performance in Q1, while operating profit declined by $9 million versus same period last year. The decline was due to a one-time $24 million accounting methodology driven gain we booked in last year's Q1 and called out at the time. Absent this gain operating profit improved about 33% supported by co-investment returns, which benefited from appreciating asset values. Investment management AUM reached a new record of nearly $147 billion with logistics and infrastructure climbing by 9% and 7% respectively over the quarter. AUM growth was driven by $4 billion of net capital inflows as well as higher property valuations only partially offset by unfavorable FX rates. We've also continued to benefit from the partnership between our investment management and development businesses, which has supported AUM growth for investment management and pipeline growth for our develop business. Turning to Slide 12 CBRE repurchased more than $390 million of shares in the first quarter, a record amount. As Bob mentioned, year-to-date through May 3rd we repurchase nearly 7 million shares for $627 million. We anticipate maintaining a significant pace of are repurchases for the balance of the year, absent, substantial and compelling M&A opportunities. We also remain committed to maintaining a durable balance sheet. Net leverage was just under 0.1 turns at the end of Q1, well below the midpoint of our zero to 2 times target range. This is despite the share purchases, seasonally higher use of cash for employee incentive compensation in this seasonally light revenue and earnings typical of our first quarter. Absent any substantial M&A opportunities we anticipate remaining below 1-turn at the end of 2022, even allowing for an elevated pace of share repurchases. Turning to Slide 13, as we look ahead, we have the same expectation for achieving mid-to-high teams consolidated core earnings growth for the full year that we provided at the end of February. Our business today continues to have strong momentum. Our base of contractual work in project management, facilities management and investment management is large and growing rapidly and lease and sales transaction activity through April remains robust. Commercial real estate markets also are healthy with office, retail and multifamily fundamentals improving and industrial fundamentals remaining strong in core markets. Materially offsetting these continued positive trends, the broad economic backdrop has softened and interest rates have risen since we've provided our earnings outlook in late February. We have taken some of these dynamics into consideration in reaffirming our full year expectations. Specifically should an economic downturn emerge we expect the more resilient and secularly favored parts of our business to help offset any potential weakening and other parts of our business. In particular, we have noted that office leasing is benefiting from strong tailwinds that we expect to sustain for some period of time. Additionally, we have identified cost measures, we can implement quickly should market conditions warrant. On the other hand, if the macro environment remains supportive for the rest of the year, there could be upside to our current expectations. Additionally, our outlook does not include any benefit from incremental M&A activity or share repurchases. We expected to be active capital allocators for the rest of the year and would be positioned to move aggressively in a weaker economic environment. We look forward to updating you when we report second quarter results in July. With that operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. I would just add that our pipeline is really strong for M&A, so we're building it for the rest of this year and 2023 and beyond so that we can really be ready when we believe valuations will come down and we can be aggressive in taking advantage of that opportunity. And then I will also add that I said this in my remarks but it's important to reiterate that our outlook does not include any this M&A this year or incremental buyback. So all of that should be upside to our outlook this year, and that stands for 2023 and beyond. Our long-term outlook does not include material capital allocation. So, yes, I think that [indiscernible] well, but to put some more color around that, and to be clear, if we weren't seeing pressures from the macro environment we would be increasing outlook. And so we've spent a lot of time sensitizing what we think is going to happen through the second half of the year. And there are a number of factors that are giving us confidence that will \u2013 that we'll deliver the outlook that we expected to in February. Like you said in Q1 has been really strong. Our pipelines for Q2 and our transaction business are very strong, we are anticipating if interest rates rises as expected there will be slowdowns in parts of our business in the second half of the year, which will be offset by our secularly favorite parts of our business. And again, I want to remind everyone that capital allocation is not included in our outlook, so that will be upside. And then I also want to mention that in my remarks, I talked about the cost levers that we have in place. So if things turn in a different direction then we're expecting, and there is more pressure. We have cost levers that we know we can pull, and we've proven that we can pull through 2020 and 2021. So that gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in 2022. And then we also look towards 2023, because we know everyone's really thinking about what's going to happen if interest rates continue to rise. And we ran some sensitivities around what we expect next year and everything that we said about 2022 really holds for 2023. We have \u2013 we are more contractual. We have more recurring revenue than we've ever had before. We've invested in growing in our \u2013 in secularly favorite areas. And we believe those parts of our business are really going to offset areas where we'll see pressure like capital markets and potentially in development. So we feel very positively about where we're going to go in 2022 and 2023, and think there is upside to what we're talking about. So the capital allocation strategy that we've talked about over the past few quarters remains unchanged. We are prioritizing accretive strategic M&A when we see opportunities arise and we're very focused on building that pipeline, and executing on those opportunities. But valuations are high and so it's really important that we're patient. We want to make sure that we're delivering returns that are well above the returns we can deliver through buybacks. But we always said we would balance that with buybacks when we don't see a huge opportunity for transformational M&A within a year. And so that's what we've done. We've seen a value opportunity. Our price has been very attractive. So as long as that continues we will continue to buy back shares through the rest of the year. So, we're making a shift, as you can see in this quarter to really focus on our consolidated performance, because we are a more mature, diversified business where we have multiple levers. And one single factor we don't believe should impact our long-term or even near-term growth trajectory. So, I'm not going to comment on specific parts of our business, but as both Bob and I've talked about where we potentially see a slowdown in the second half of the year is primarily in capital markets. And then I do want to comment on development. I mentioned this in my remarks and we mentioned it last quarter, but simply because of timing, the majority of our development profits are going to hit in the first half of this year. It doesn't have anything to do with the external environment. It's simply when these projects are expected to be completed. And if you look at those profits on an annual basis, I think, that's the best way to look at the sustainability and the stability of those profits. We've said that about 1% to 2% of our in process portfolio typically converts to SOP in any given 12-month period. Right now we're slightly ahead of that, but if you extrapolate that to 2023 and expect that profit to move more in the 1% to 2% range, that can give you an idea of the sustainability and stability of our development pipeline. So the only place where we're seeing costs come back, which we anticipated and talked about in Q4 is within our GWS business. And that's just our reversion to pre-pandemic levels. During the pandemic, we were servicing facilities and buildings, although people weren't going to disabilities and office buildings. And so the cost to service those buildings declined in an unusual way. So we're going back, we're reverting to normal with in our GWS business. And we're seeing some margin pressure this quarter. We expect that to like to mediate throughout this year.  So margins within a legacy GWS business is slight tick up through the remainder of the year. But in the rest of our business, we're actually seeing within advisory you're seeing stronger margins than we expected and so that's evidence of our ability to control our cost all of the cost measures we put in place. Bob mentioned that our discretionary costs this quarter are down pretty meaningfully. And our hiring has flowed somewhat simply because of the challenge labor market. So we feel really good about our margins. So, there's two factors. One, private capital has been very aggressive with their lending terms, so the GSEs are simply being outcompeted. And then the GSEs pulled back. If you think about Q1 of last year they needed to provide liquidity. And this quarter, because the markets have been flooded with liquidity, they didn't have that same that same need. So we do see that alleviating somewhat as valuations increase and the GSEs come up to speed to where the private markets are. One of the factors that's impacting the GSEs is that they do have new leadership in place, so as they go through that transition and as the leadership comes into gain some \u2013 moves further into their term, we expect GSEs to pick up."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristyn. And good morning, everyone. The year has started out strong for CBRE with excellent momentum across all three business segments. Globally, net revenue increased more than 30% and GAAP EPS and core EPS were up 48% and 72% respectively in the first quarter. We saw strong property sales growth in virtually every corner of the world. Office and retail continued to rebound nicely from COVID suppressed levels and multifamily and industrial maintained strong momentum. The continued rebound in leasing velocity is also encouraging. Notably office leasing revenues surpassed one, 2019 levels in both EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Office activity in the U.S. improved significantly, but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Despite the lag in U.S. office, overall global leasing revenue is 20% above the Q1 2019 peak. We achieved these strong revenue gains while keeping expense growth in check, which is a top priority for us. Our core EBITDA margin on net revenue improved 280 basis points over the prior year, quarter, notably discretionary expenses were 27% below first quarter, 2019 levels, while net revenue was up 42% versus the same period. We continue to execute a strategy to diversify our business both organically and through investment broadly, across, the four dimensions we've talked about regularly over the last couple years, asset types, lines of business, clients and geographies. Our performance for the quarter drives home how effectively this strategy is working. We saw continued gains from the purposeful investments we have been making in parts of our business that are benefiting from enduring growth trends. Examples include the industrial and multifamily asset classes, which we invest in and serve broadly. Our local facilities management and our project management lines of business, and several of our geographies, particularly North Asia, where we continue to see strong growth. Notably, Turner & Townsend continues to perform ahead of our expectations, both financially and operationally, and we are enthusiastic about the added dimensions they bring to global project management offering, particularly in infrastructure, natural resources and sustainability services. We generate significant cash that is being strategically deployed into growth areas of our business, while we are also returning cash to shareholders at an elevated clip. Year-to-date share repurchases have totaled $627 million. I'll close with the word about Ukraine, which I know is top of mind for many of you. In early March, we decided to exit most of our business in Russia while keeping some employees in that country to manage facilities for multinational clients, consistent with our contractual obligations. We are inspired by the Ukrainian people's brave resistance to Russia's unprovoked aggression. With that, I'll turn the call over to Emma, who will discuss the quarter and the outlook. Chandni, I'm going to comment and then I'm going to ask Emma to do the same. I want to remind everybody that in addition to being our CFO, Emma oversees our M&A activities. So she's got great insight into this. But I want to start with the notion that M&A is a core competency of our company and we expect our leaders around the world to identify M&A opportunities that help us add to the capability we can offer to our clients. We're also increasingly focused on driving capital and resources into areas of our business with secular benefit and we're really well positioned to do that because we have such a strong base of operations across the four dimensions we talk about; product type, service type, client type, and geography. Prices have been high recently, which means that we've been a little bit careful about what we might queue up for acquisition. We think if the environment slows a bit, gets a little tougher because of inflation or a recession that might be ahead of us that our opportunity to invest will grow. But we are looking across our business for two types of acquisitions, and I'm being redundant here, but I want to say it again. Acquisitions that add to our capability to serve our clients and acquisitions that drive diversification across our business and we have a good pipeline of both types of candidates. I also want to say that we're looking at things that we haven't looked at traditionally that we think are a really good fit for our business. One of the best examples I can give you recently, of course is Turner & Townsend which was a very unique acquisition for us and the early returns on it were about as good as I've ever seen us have on a big acquisition. So with that I'm going to ask you to add to that, Emma. Well, that's a multi-layered question, Chandni. There's a lot of focus on cap rates. There's a lot of focus on the cost of debt, but when you look at the trading of assets and the value of assets you also have to look at fundamentals and you also have to look at the amount of capital that's out there pursuing those assets. Fundamentals are exceptionally strong. I think historically strong in the multifamily asset class. Vacancy is as low as it's been in 20 years. The amount of pent-up demand relative to the amount of vacancy is also as low as it's been in 20 years. There's upward pressure on rents and there's more renters out there in the market than there is new product coming online. So that bodes well for the value of those assets. The other thing that I think gets missed a little bit by people and it's sometimes cited as a problem for our sector, which it is a challenge, and that is what's going on with the cost of assets. The cost of assets is going up. Construction cost is going up. Fundamentals have allowed rental rates to make up for that and the value of assets, but when you think about \u2013 how investors think about product, one of the things they always consider is replacement cost. Anybody that comes into the market today and buys assets can have a decent level of confidence that replacement cost is going to be above what they pay for those assets, so that's positive dynamic. And it's not as extreme with the industrial asset class as it is with the multifamily asset class, but when you go into core markets around the U.S. the big gateway markets and the most important secondary markets. And when you look at modern large industrial assets which is where we play primarily, the fundamentals there are extremely strong as well. So I was meeting with one of the most active players in the New York \u2013 New Jersey industrial market yesterday and their comment was it's sold out, right? There's not available space up there. And the Amazon news is important. They've been the biggest \u2013 the biggest leaser in across the U.S. the last couple years, I will tell you that Amazon their percentage of the market slowed down in the last 12 months by over half what it was in 2020 and the fundamentals haven't really changed. There's strong, strong demand for any space that exists out there. So we're relatively bullish about what's going to happen with values for both multifamily and industrial assets at the same time we're very aware that if there is a recession, if [indiscernible] do take up, if debt becomes more expensive which it will, there could be a period of time when the buyers and sellers go to the sideline, and that's baked into our thoughts about where we're headed for this year and next year. Tony, we think \u2013 well, first of all, that's a very big part of \u2013 GSE business is a very big part of our lending business. It's moved more to private lending in the last quarter, and the first quarter of this year. And we're watching to see what's going to play out for the rest of the year and next year, as it relates to mortgage servicing, which has become a big and very recurring, very contractual business for us. We expect that continue to grow partly from the business that we source, but also partly from business that we take on from others. Market conditions are really good in EMEA right now, I was just over there last week. I was over there for a Turner & Townsend Board meeting, which by the way that company is doing extremely well. And what we found out was across the UK and across Europe leasing is strong and coming back, the industrial asset class is holding up well, there's large amounts of capital to be invested in commercial and multifamily assets. Multifamilies are smaller business over there than it is over here. I would say the fundamentals across Europe right now are quite strong and our business is performing \u2013 our advisory business there is performing better than it's ever performed in the history of our company. So we're feeling really good about that business now. Well, it's important to remember that we bought 60% of the business, 40% of business remains with the partners that the legacy partners in Turner & Townsend. We govern that company through a board of directors, three directors from CBRE three directors from Turner & Townsend. And the integration has largely been a revenue integration. We have not tried to seek cost synergies out of that deal. We have not tried to alter the way they go-to-market. The infrastructure that supports that business is our infrastructure, the way the integration is progressing is we're working with them to bring them into our client relationships as an added capability. We have some other resources that we're providing to them to help them grow their business, but it is not a traditional full on integration. The best comp for Turner & Townsend in our company would be the way we operate Trammell Crow Company, although we own a hundred percent of it, roughly 40% of the economics go to the developers. Trammell Crow Company has kept its brand. They've operated independently. They have a tremendous culture and they've grown tremendously. And we've modeled Turner & Townsend after that. They liked that model. They wanted that model. We're six months or so into the relationship. As I said, in my opening remarks, both financially and operationally it's proceeding better than we had thought it would proceed. And we were quite bullish about the investment when we made it. There is a bunch of stuff that Turner & Townsend would like to do, and we would like to do together with them that we haven't been able to get to yet simply. They're running at capacity and as they add capacity, that capacity is fully utilized. So, there's a good deal of upside associated with what might happen with Turner & Townsend and next year and beyond. And Emma kind of commented on that when she gave you that little snapshot of how we think 2023 might play out. We think there is some upside to Turner & Townsend because of the secularly benefited areas that they operate in. There's a lot there in that question, Jade. Let me try to take the pieces off as you ask them. So first of all, with regard to energy/sustainability, we're embedding that in many of our services across the company. And it's not necessarily a separate profit line, but the capability in our facilities management and property management and project management and development businesses that brings sustainability to those product lines helps us grow those businesses. And then Turner & Townsend directly does things with regards to sustainability that are important product lines for them. Infrastructure, you're going to see growth in infrastructure through Turner & Townsend. You're going to see growth in infrastructure through our investment management business, and they've grown the AUM there very nicely. But when you look across our business, and again, I want to beat this drum because it's so important, we are really broadly diversified across product type, service type, client type and line of business. So where are we going to see growth across those four dimensions. The work we do for big technology companies around the world is going to continue to grow significantly. And it's likely not going to be all that subjected to economic downturns compared to some other things out there. Project management, with all that's going on with sustainability, with all that's going on with reorienting offices to the future way they'll be use, we think that there's going to be sustainable growth there. Ironically, when you look at what's happened to our business over the last two or three years during the COVID area \u2013 era, everybody knows that we faced secular headwinds in the office building part of our business, which is a big part of our business. What we now believe for at least the next two or three years, we're going to have real secular tailwinds with office as occupiers go back to renewing or changing the leases they have. We've got a very good insight into what that pipeline looks like as occupiers reconfigure their space, et cetera. We think we're going to actually benefit. At the same time, we might see some downward pressure from what's going on with interest rates and cap rates and the economy as a whole, we actually think office is going to come back in and provide some tailwinds for us. We're very, very encouraged about that. And then when you kind of get deeper into our business and look at those four dimensions, I'll give you an example of something that we haven't talked a lot about, we've mentioned it kind of in passing. But if you look at our advisory business, over the last few years I often get the question, what part of the world should that business grow the most. And well, it should grow the most in part of the world where the economy is growing the most and that continues to be Asia. If you went back five or six years, our advisory business in North Asia was probably no more than 1% to 2% of our business. It's likely to be 6% to 7% of our advisory business this year. Not that much of it in China because of what's going on in China, but Korea is really growing for us, Japan is really growing for us, Hong Kong is really growing for us. We have a nice business in Taiwan, and then we think eventually, China is going to kick in when things sort out now. So we've got pockets of opportunity for growth across those four dimensions. And that's why when Emma talks about what's going to go on the rest of this year and thinks about what might happen next year even if things get a little tough in the economy, even if we go into a mild recession, we're pretty encouraged about where we sit out there. And then, of course, in all of those areas, we have capital to drive into acquisitions if things slow down, and it's easier to buy some things than it is today. And we do watch the denominator effect, and we're wondering if that's going to have an impact next year depending on what happens with equities. If those go down and then real estate holds up and becomes a bigger part of the portfolios that may put a little downward pressure on some institutions buying commercial assets. But I will tell you what we've seen around the world, around the world, is there is more capital for real estate than there is real estate for capital right now and that's equity capital and that's debt capital. And people really like the fundamentals and they believe in this asset class more and more for the long-term. There could be an interruption later this year, there could be an interruption next year, but the long-term trajectory is more institutional capital is being aimed at commercial real estate assets and institutional quality multifamily assets. And the base of assets around the world is growing. So we think that this is a really nice, long-term trend for our company in the sector we compete in. There is a few things about that trend that are really important to our business. One is that institutions historically have tended to trade a bit more than non-institutional owners. So that's good. That adds to the velocity associated with our brokerage businesses, both brokerage of debt and brokerage of the assets themselves. Secondly, what's happening is these institutions that are controlling the assets are growing; they're getting bigger and bigger. And they tend to want to work with fewer and fewer service providers. We're a beneficiary of that. By the way, we're a big beneficiary of that with occupiers and we're a big beneficiary of that with investors. And one of the things we've done with our family is \u2013 not with our family, with our company is working incredibly hard to be connected across lines of business and geographies so that we can offer a product to these big institutions that invest in real estate and these big occupiers that use real estate, so that they feel like they can comfortably use us instead of a group of companies. That's been a really powerful trend for us. We expect it to consider or we expect it to continue. And so when you look at what you're describing, Stephen, for the institutional ownership of assets, we think it's going to be a positive secular driver in the growth of CBRE, and we think \u2013 and the same thing is going to happen with the occupiers, and it is happening. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you in three months when we report our second quarter earnings."

I'm joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our Chair and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now, please turn to slide 5, as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE ended 2023 on a high note with fourth quarter year-over-year operating profit growth across all three of our business segments. Even though 2023 was a difficult year for commercial real estate, we delivered the third highest full year earnings in CBRE's history as our resilient businesses continued their strong growth. This partly offset market-driven revenue declines in businesses that are sensitive to interest rates and debt availability. Emma will talk about our resilient businesses in greater detail at the beginning of her comments. We are committed to driving significant gains in all of our businesses with a particular focus on through-cycle resiliency and double-digit compound long-term earnings growth. Two recent wins highlight our progress. First, with the acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services and our GWS segment, we will increase our technical services capabilities for US federal government clients and open a mostly untapped channel in a difficult to penetrate market. This is a large market characterized by steady growth and long-term contracts. Second, our strategic partnership to provide property management services for Brookfield Properties, 65 million square foot US office portfolio is among the largest in the history of our sector. We believe there will be more opportunities of this nature, which we are well positioned to capture. We start 2024 with strong new business pipelines across our company. We also see attractive M&A and REI co-investment opportunities. Investor and lender sentiment has improved and we anticipate this will lead to increased transaction volumes, starting in the second half of the year when short-term interest rates are expected to fall. Against this backdrop, we expect to achieve core EPS of $4.25 to $4.65 in 2024, implying mid-teens percentage growth at the midpoint of the range. This broad range reflects the difficulty in predicting the precise timing of a recovery. It is notable that any outcome in this range would still be well below the long-term earnings potential of CBRE. With that, Emma will walk you through our results and outlook in more detail.\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob. Before turning to segment performance, please turn to Page 6, as I provide more insight into our resilient businesses. We've used this term regularly in our earnings calls over the last several quarters and it is now being used broadly in our sector. CBRE defines resilient businesses, as those which hold up well in a down market cycle, either because of their noncyclical characteristics or because they benefit from secular tailwinds. For CBRE, those businesses include the entire GWS segment, loan servicing, valuation, property management and recurring asset management fees in our investment management business. When we use this term, this is the group of businesses we are referencing. These resilient businesses in aggregate generated nearly $1.6 billion of SOP in 2023 and are expected to generate $1.8 billion of SOP in 2024. This would represent a sixfold increase from 2011, the first full year of market recovery following the global financial crisis. We expect 2024 to be the beginning of a market recovery, albeit a more gradual one. For context, our resilient businesses have grown SOP over 3x as fast as our transactional businesses, since 2011 and they are expected to be nearly double the size of our entire business at a similar point in the last cycle. Please turn to Page 7, as I review our results and outlook for 2024. Across the advisory segment, net revenue and SOP essentially matched the prior year's Q4. Leasing saw a slight uptick in revenue for the quarter driven mostly by EMEA and APAC. Globally, higher office leasing offset slightly less industrial activity. Within property sales, industrial and retail declined less than multifamily and office, supported by healthy fundamentals. Commercial mortgage origination revenue growth was attributable to interest earnings on escrow balances. The rest of our advisory business lines together achieved a 6% net revenue increase. Turning to Page 8. GWS had another strong quarter. Net revenue and SOP grew by double-digits. Facilities Management net revenue increased 14% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Most significantly, our sizable GWS local business has been increasing net revenue at or above a mid-teens clip, and is well positioned to sustain this growth rate for the long term. Project Management net revenue grew 11% for the quarter and 14% for the year. This was led by the large-scale program management work being done globally by Turner & Townsend. Notably, we had record pipeline conversion to new GWS contracts during Q4 with a balanced mix of new clients and existing client expansions. Turning to Page 9. SOP in our REI segment increased to $68 million in Q4, up from just $17 million in the prior year Q4. Development exceeded expectations due to the earlier than anticipated monetization of several assets in the US. Investment Management operating profit rose significantly in Q4, driven by higher incentive fees and recurring asset management fees. Investment management AUM ended 2023 at $148 billion, up $3 billion for the quarter, largely driven by favorable currency movement and modest net capital inflows, which offset lower private asset values. For the year, AUM was down $2 billion. While exit value declines appear to be slowing, we anticipate values will remain under pressure in early 2024. Before turning to our 2024 outlook, I'll comment on our capital allocation strategy on Slide 10. We are on track to deploy more than $2 billion of capital for the 12 months ending Q1 2024. This deployment includes M&A, mostly in our resilient businesses and a record level of co-investment commitments in REI. By thoughtfully using our balance sheet we made targeted opportunistic investments, while other investors have been largely on the sidelines. These investments have been underwritten at returns, well above our cost of capital. And specifically, our REI investments are projected to generate notably high returns. We also repurchased nearly 8 million shares in 2023 at a time when we believe they have been attractively valued. Our 2024 capital deployment will be supported by improved free cash flow, which we expect to total at least $1 billion, as certain headwinds reversed this year. As we've previously discussed, we had several large cash expenses in 2023 mostly timing-related items, such as cash variable compensation and cash income taxes tied to 2022 record results that did not flex down with last year's lower earnings. We estimate that the reversal of these items alone will drive a $500 million benefit to free cash flow compared with last year. Taking all of this into consideration, we expect to end 2024 with net leverage around one turn. Now I'll review our 2024 outlook on Slide 11. In the advisory segment, we expect net revenue to increase by mid- to high single-digits, with mid-teens SOP growth. The expected margin improvement reflects fixed cost leverage and the benefit of ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Advisory accounts for about two-thirds of the $150 million run rate cost savings initiative announced last quarter with half of the benefit being realized in 2024. These savings offset cost growth elsewhere in advisory this year notably from higher expected discretionary compensation tied to improved financial performance. We anticipate that capital markets revenue will grow by mid-single digits. Investor sentiment has improved in the last nine days, reflecting a better interest rate outlook. Real estate allocations are approaching target levels and this reflects an easing of the denominator effect, as public equity markets have rebounded while private relist values are being written down. We expect leasing to grow modestly in 2024. We are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over for office leasing, particularly for Class A properties, where we generate approximately two-thirds of leasing revenue. Leading indicators from our data partner VTS indicate US office demand has been gradually turning up over the last six months. The growing consensus about an economic soft landing coupled with the apparent stabilization of office utilization rates may make more employers confident enough to commit to office leases. Additionally, leasing demand should remain relatively strong for industrial deals particularly for properties under 500,000 square feet. Our remaining advisory business lines together are expected to achieve low double-digit net revenue growth. In the GWS segment, we expect mid-teen SOP growth including the expected partial year contribution from the J&J acquisition. Continued strong organic growth will be driven by broad demand across client sectors and geographies. The local business will lead growth in GWS expected to generate more than $200 million of operating profit as we benefit further from our investments in this business. Our enterprise business is also seeing strong demand from both mature sectors like financial services as well as newer adopters of outsourcing such as industrial, healthcare and life sciences companies. Within project management significant growth will be led by Turner & Townsend, which is in the early stages of penetrating the US. market. We anticipate seeing most of the revenue impact from our sizable Q4 wins in the second half of 2024 as new clients are onboarded. And even with the record level of conversions in Q4 our GWS pipeline ended 2023 10% higher than the prior year. Shifting to REI. We expect SOP in 2024 to be slightly below 2023's level. Note that last year's SOP included a single development portfolio sales, which generated more than $100 million of profit in Q1. In Investment Management, we expect operating profit to increase modestly from 2023 as stabilizing market conditions drive higher promote fees and improved co-investment returns. We expect development operating profit will be subdued this year as the projects we expect to monetize will be sold at higher cap rates than we underwrote at the peak of the prior market cycle. At current market cap rates we have hundreds of millions of dollars of operating profit embedded in our in-process portfolio and a pipeline of new opportunities with an attractive spread between our cost of development and current market value. On balance, we are cautiously optimistic about 2024. Our expectation of achieving core EPS of $4.25 to $4.65 is contingent on long-term interest rates remaining around current levels the Fed proceeding with the anticipated short-term rig cuts and the US economy avoiding a recession. This year's earnings are likely to be more heavily weighted than usual to the second half. The third and fourth quarters are expected to account for approximately two-thirds of our EPS while the first quarter will contribute a mid-teens percentage of the annual total. This distribution is similar to what we experienced in 2021 when we also had a second half recovery. We continue to see a path to returning to our prior core PS peak in 2025. That path is supported by continued double-digit growth in our resilient businesses and a gradual recovery in our transactional businesses. Importantly, CBRE can reach prior record earnings without our transactional businesses SOP rebounding to 2019 levels. With that operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you. Good morning. I guess, my first question is I look at the guideposts for the various business lines. They seem kind of pretty good from our vantage point. But just wondering if you could talk about things like the corporate segment taxes, interest expense creation all that sort of other stuff and any year-over-year drags or ability to quantify any notable drags from those items as we think about going down to EPS.\nEmma Giamartino : Yes, Tony. So, first to step back on our outlook just give context around the range, which I think will help get to the corporate and below the line items. If you look at our segment level guidance, I think, what you're seeing is that you likely get to an EPS that's slightly above the midpoint of our range. And what we baked into the midpoint of our EPS guidance is some level of conservatism, given that rates have continued to bubble especially in the past few weeks. So it's safe to assume on the corporate cost level the corporate segment level that is going uptick slightly, but not as much as your -- the number that you're looking at might imply. And the reason corporate will uptick slightly is because primarily, because our bonuses discretionary compensation will reset to levels that are in line with improved financial performance. And then I'll comment on the range of our outlook. The pieces that we have a high level of conviction around is our growth in our resilient SOP. We talked about that growing from $1.6 billion this year to $1.8 billion next year or 2024 and that's consistent across the range. And then our transactional business lines are clearly the ones that will move us towards the bottom end or the high end of the range depending on when the recovery begins.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just in terms of you talked about ending the year with a turn of leverage and it sounds like incremental investment into REI and so forth and then obviously J&J, but just like how much of the benefit from all of the capital investments do you think you'll see in 2024 versus 2025 or in future periods?\nEmma Giamartino : I'll primarily speak to J&J, we are expecting to get likely three quarters of the benefit of that acquisition in year and we talked about what the EBITDA we're expecting for J&J in our press release about $65 million for the year. It is safe to assume we'll get three quarters of that in the year. The remainder of the co-investments in REI will be weighted more towards 2025 and beyond those funds. Funds get launched and our developments get monetized.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. And I guess just on capital deployment, I realize with the stock may be shooting up a lot in the fourth quarter that temperature enthusiasm for share buybacks. You only did about $20 million in the quarter. Just with share buybacks sort of fit in on the capital deployment in 2024 or at least within your guidance?\nEmma Giamartino: So what we've always talked about is a balance of M&A our investments -- our co-investments in REI and share buybacks, and we'll do buybacks to balance out the other two when we view our share price to be attractive. We really saw in Q4 is that we were anticipating our -- the announcement of our acquisition of J&J. That deal is delivering a return well above our cost of capital. It's more accretive than buybacks in our analysis. And so you're seeing a weight more towards M&A. And I expect that to continue this year. We -- our M&A pipeline is building. We're seeing a greater ability to transact sellers are more willing to meet our value expectations. So where we sit right now expect the balance to be towards M&A this year. But of course, if that changes we'll look to repurchase shares.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And I know you provided a bunch of guidepost certainly on the revenue side. I just want to make sure from a margin perspective, I just kind of understand, how are you thinking about the SOP margin in advisory? And is there any sort of baked in improvement to margin in the GWS business?\nEmma Giamartino: So, on the advisory side, you should see improvement in our overall advisory margin in 2024, probably about 100 basis points. That's because of our cost reduction plans and obviously a recovery in our transactions business. In GWS, our margins should hover around NIM level and increased slightly. The J&J acquisition is slightly accretive to our margins. But this is a business as you know that we don't expect to see a step function change in our margin over time, it will gradually increase as we continue to differentiate that business.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you, very much. There's considerable uncertainty in the multifamily market. Walker & Dunlop just said on its earnings call that the GSEs Fannie and Freddie expect flat volumes for 2024 which is surprising given how low volumes were in 2023. In addition, we are seeing pockets of credit issues in floating rate loans and then significant supply. So I wanted to ask, if you could comment on your overall volume expectations within that sector. And also as it relates to Trammell Crow, I think that around 30% of that business's projects are multifamily, do you expect any issues bringing those to fruition and generating target returns.\nBob Sulentic: I'll comment on the -- Jade on the Trammell Crow Company circumstance and then Emma can comment on the volumes, the financing volumes. We are taking on a steady stream of new land sites in Trammell Crow Company that we're underwriting at returns that we think based on current cap rates will be consistent with our historical returns in that business. This is one of the things that's really doesn't show up in any of our headlines that makes us excited about future profitability. It is true that there is some pressure in the multifamily markets based on the development that's happened over the last couple of years and the cost of leverage versus where those deals that yields those deals were developed at. We think that is going to be self-correcting over the next couple of years. New development volume is going to come down. We're still at barely above historic levels of vacancy. I think maybe 50 basis points above historic levels, about 550 basis points of vacancy versus 5% historically. We think that is going to correct. We think the circumstance in the single-family home market with the cost of mortgages is going to drive people towards renting. And so, we are quite bullish after we get through a little tough window here in the multifamily business on where that's going to go. We're bullish about what it means for Trammell Crow Company. We're bullish about what it means for our investment management business. And we think that the volumes in our services business will be good over time, but we are going to go through as you commented from the Walker & Dunlop call, there will be a window where it's a little more difficult. That's fully contemplated by the way in the numbers that Emma gave you about our expectations for 2024. Emma, you want to add to that?\nEmma Giamartino: And then on the GSEs, we have embedded in our forecast pretty much OMSR being flat to slightly up this year. Sentiment that we're seeing from the agencies is that they will get closer to their cash this year. But we are being conservative in terms of what we're projecting for the year. So, slightly more positive than what you heard on the Walker & Dunlop.\nJade Rahmani: On the office leasing side, you mentioned you think that the worst is over there. And that 65% of the business is Class A. Can you give any more color around maybe some anecdotal evidence or perhaps survey evidence takes you confidence around that? I do know you put out monthly and quarterly reports from research showing such as tenants in market or requirements.\nBob Sulentic: Well, it is the case that we think it has bottomed out. It obviously is below -- meaningfully below where it was occupancy is square footage per person is below where it was per employee is, below where it was in 2019. There is all kinds of anecdotal evidence around that issue, some stubbornness people coming back to the office. That's super clear. The other thing is there's just a clear amount of pressure from companies to get their people back into the office for all kinds of reasons. What we do know and I would say anecdotal evidence in this area is not just evidence it's an avalanche of evidence. Every company that you talk to, you can't talk to a corporate that would tell you that office building occupancy, either in buildings they own or building they lease is not important to their business. It's important to all of them. It's important to us in our business. And so what you're seeing is that people are redoing their space, trying to make it a better environment for their employees, make their employees more efficient, more engaged. Class A buildings that create that opportunity are seeing in a number of markets record rents. Buildings that aren't good are struggling and they're going to continue to struggle. So we look at that circumstance, and we say there's pressure on both sides, but we think it's kind of stabilized. We think it will be a very big asset class going forward, bigger than the headlines might suggest because people tend to like negative news. And in the real estate services business, as opposed to the real estate owning businesses and we're in both of them. It's going to be a very large opportunity for CBRE, and you saw that with the Brookfield situation that we announced. You see that with the growth in our outsourcing business. You're seeing it come through in our leasing numbers. So I think that you're going to see the future be better than the current circumstance has been for a variety of reasons.\nJade Rahmani: I wanted to also, if I may ask about infrastructure. The J&J acquisition deepens relationships with the Department of Defense, in particular, it seems. And also, we are seeing robust capital flows across the infrastructure space, particularly in digital data centers. I wanted to ask if you could comment if that's a strategic target perhaps an area for M&A or co-investment on the Trammell Crow side?\nBob Sulentic: We're -- well, Jade, you're talking about the blurred lines between real estate and infrastructure and some regard. And in those areas data centers and so forth we do have meaningful exposure. The places where we have kind of traditionally defined infrastructure exposure or with the Turner & Townsend business where they provide a lot of program and project and cost consulting services to infrastructure-type projects and they are really well-positioned for the future in that regard. We have an infrastructure investment management business that we would like to scale over time. And then in Trammell Crow Company, we do a variety of development. There are some things we're working on that are quite large between Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend that would be in the infrastructure category. So, we believe over time we'll evolve to a place where we will do more work and invest more in infrastructure, but real estate is our core business for the time being.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nStephen Sheldon: Hey, thank you. Really nice job here and congrats on the J&J deal. With J&J likely to close here in the coming months, I just wanted to ask kind of what your appetite is for pursuing other large acquisitions? I know you guys are kind of looking at least a few larger deals. So, just curious if you have any commentary on what your appetite is if you're still pursuing or looking at some larger acquisitions.\nBob Sulentic: M&A work is a fundamental foundational element of what CBRE is about. We are committed across all of our lines of business to be a grower. We have built within our market-facing businesses capability to identify M&A opportunities in all of our businesses. We clearly have some places we're more interested in at any given point in time typically because they're secularly favored because we have more of a right to win but it is fundamental and if you look across our business, our people are in the market identifying opportunities at all times. We have built up our M&A capability in the center our corporate development capability to the point where we think it's quite unique within our sector and is relatively strong against the broader base of companies out there outside our sectors -- are outside our sector. We have a strong balance sheet and willingness to use that balance sheet to do M&A. So, you should expect us to continue to build the business through M&A. We aren't going to do deals that we aren't -- that we don't think are smart either financially or because they're hard to integrate or too hard to integrate. And it wasn't hard to watch us in the past year and say that maybe listening from quarter-to-quarter there was more going on than you were seeing where you saw the J&J deal at the end. There will be other things but we won't force M&A. We'll do M&A where we think we can grow our business the way we want to grow it into areas with secular tailwind, in the areas where we have the right to win and as Emma has said, it will likely be over the long-term our number one use of capital.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. Thanks. And then just in capital markets just kind of just as we think about the last few months how did activity progress through the fourth quarter into early January. I'm just curious whether you've seen fits and starts of activity based upon what's happening with interest rates? And just generally, how dependent do you think any capital is improvement in 2024 and I guess into 2025 will be on the overall trend in interest rates?\nEmma Giamartino: So, let's start with what we've been seeing over the past through 2023 and through the end of the year. And we did see a significant deceleration in the decline, especially getting into Q4. So, through the third quarter, you're looking at 40% decline up to that point. And then in the fourth quarter, we were down to below 20% decline. And what was notable about Q4 was that we actually saw a significant deceleration in December. So October, November had greater declines than December, which was in the single-digit decline in territory. So pulling that into 2024, we are not expecting a material uplift in capital markets activity, but we do expect it to grow at a mid single-digit rate globally. If the recovery picks up faster than we're expecting if rates come down further than the market is expecting then there could be upside from there. But our base case scenario is that there won't be a significant uplift.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Griffin from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMichael Griffin: Great. Thanks. Just maybe going back to the guidance for a minute, and I appreciate you guys including it this year. I'm just curious if you can quantify give us a sense of if there are any cost savings initiatives factored into your outlook? I want to get a sense of how much of this growth is organic versus cost cutting?\nEmma Giamartino: So there are cost savings embedded in our outlook, and where you will see the majority of it is within our advisory business, which I talked about earlier about 100 basis points of margin expansion in advisory. We talked about $150 million of run rate cost savings in -- on our Q3 call that we're going to go after this year. We have identified opportunities to reduce $150 million of run rate cost. You'll see about half of that in year and most of that will be in the advisory segment. A piece to note about that is those cost savings are largely offsetting our bonuses resetting and our discretionary compensation in our profit shares resetting to levels that are in line with our positive financial performance for the year, but it isn't embedded in numbers that you're seeing.\nMichael Griffin: Got you. That's helpful. Then maybe on the REI segment. I was curious, if you could give us some insights into how development costs have been trending and where return hurdles and IRR is currently in the space what would get you more interested in starting projects?\nBob Sulentic: Well, I'm going to start with cost. That is starting to come under control. We had challenges, everybody that was a developer in the United States and around the world had challenges with cost the last few years. Now that was all typically rescued by accelerating rental rates and declining cap rates, and we think all of that has stabilized. Cap rates have gone up. Rental rate growth has slowed, but cost growth has also come under control. So that's all come back into balance. We are underwriting projects now at spreads between current cap rates and yields on projects that should deliver profitability consistent with what has been delivered in that business historically. And I mentioned this earlier and I'll mention it again within that business over the last year we've secured good volume of development sites, not at steel prices but what's happened is sites that were otherwise not available have become available. And because many, many people are on the sidelines, many developers are on the sidelines, we have the CBRE parent company balance sheet available to us. We've been able to secure a good number of development opportunities with really good spreads between current cap rates and yields on the projects. So that out in the future, we think we're well positioned for that business. And in Emma's comments, you might have noticed that she said, we've got hundreds of millions of dollars of profits captured in that in-process and pipeline portfolio development deals. We're quite excited about that.\nMichael Griffin: Great. Thats it for me. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is now live.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. And maybe nitpicky here a little bit, but can you just talk about your 2025 commentary from this morning, I think a quarter ago, you were still talking about achieving records. Now I think you're just hoping to get back to peak. So not sure if, it's the environment has changed or adjusting your I guess outlook incorporates a more conservative recovery in general. So maybe just compare and contrast, how we should be thinking about your long-term outlook as you go into 2025?\nEmma Giamartino: So I want to be clear that we see a -- we have strong visibility into returning to our peak level of EPS in 2025. And that confidence has not declined since last quarter -- is at least equal to and potentially slightly above especially, if we achieve our expectations for 2024. And I can simply break down the components of how we'll get there between our Resilient SOP and our transactional SOP. Within our resilience line of business, like I said before, we expect $1.8 billion of SOP this year, that should continue to grow at least a 10% rate next year. And we have a high level of confidence in delivering that outcome. And then on the transactional side, we do not need our transactional SOPs to return anywhere near to peak levels of earnings like we did in 2022 and they don't even need to return to our level of transactional SOP in 2019. So hopefully, that puts some perspective on our ability to achieve that outcome. The main risk is that the recovery would get delayed this year and it would make that hurdle on the transactional side slightly higher next year.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Fair enough. And then just maybe a quick follow-up on the cost base. I mean, it looks -- I mean obviously, you guys cost program in place. Since you've done a lot over the last few years, can you maybe just remind us where you think incrementals are on the transactional side and break it out maybe between capital markets and leasing, as we had potentially a recovery here?\nEmma Giamartino: So overall, on our transactional business, our incremental margins are in the low to mid-30s. This is both across capital markets and leasing, and to put some more context around that a 5% change in leasing, results in a 3% delta in EPS. And on the sales side, a 5% change in sales would be a 2% change in EPS.\nAlex Kramm: Make sense. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks very much, everyone, and we look forward to connecting with you again in 90 days.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Before turning to segment performance, please turn to Page 6, as I provide more insight into our resilient businesses. We've used this term regularly in our earnings calls over the last several quarters and it is now being used broadly in our sector. CBRE defines resilient businesses, as those which hold up well in a down market cycle, either because of their noncyclical characteristics or because they benefit from secular tailwinds. For CBRE, those businesses include the entire GWS segment, loan servicing, valuation, property management and recurring asset management fees in our investment management business. When we use this term, this is the group of businesses we are referencing. These resilient businesses in aggregate generated nearly $1.6 billion of SOP in 2023 and are expected to generate $1.8 billion of SOP in 2024. This would represent a sixfold increase from 2011, the first full year of market recovery following the global financial crisis. We expect 2024 to be the beginning of a market recovery, albeit a more gradual one. For context, our resilient businesses have grown SOP over 3x as fast as our transactional businesses, since 2011 and they are expected to be nearly double the size of our entire business at a similar point in the last cycle. Please turn to Page 7, as I review our results and outlook for 2024. Across the advisory segment, net revenue and SOP essentially matched the prior year's Q4. Leasing saw a slight uptick in revenue for the quarter driven mostly by EMEA and APAC. Globally, higher office leasing offset slightly less industrial activity. Within property sales, industrial and retail declined less than multifamily and office, supported by healthy fundamentals. Commercial mortgage origination revenue growth was attributable to interest earnings on escrow balances. The rest of our advisory business lines together achieved a 6% net revenue increase. Turning to Page 8. GWS had another strong quarter. Net revenue and SOP grew by double-digits. Facilities Management net revenue increased 14% for the quarter and 13% for the year. Most significantly, our sizable GWS local business has been increasing net revenue at or above a mid-teens clip, and is well positioned to sustain this growth rate for the long term. Project Management net revenue grew 11% for the quarter and 14% for the year. This was led by the large-scale program management work being done globally by Turner & Townsend. Notably, we had record pipeline conversion to new GWS contracts during Q4 with a balanced mix of new clients and existing client expansions. Turning to Page 9. SOP in our REI segment increased to $68 million in Q4, up from just $17 million in the prior year Q4. Development exceeded expectations due to the earlier than anticipated monetization of several assets in the US. Investment Management operating profit rose significantly in Q4, driven by higher incentive fees and recurring asset management fees. Investment management AUM ended 2023 at $148 billion, up $3 billion for the quarter, largely driven by favorable currency movement and modest net capital inflows, which offset lower private asset values. For the year, AUM was down $2 billion. While exit value declines appear to be slowing, we anticipate values will remain under pressure in early 2024. Before turning to our 2024 outlook, I'll comment on our capital allocation strategy on Slide 10. We are on track to deploy more than $2 billion of capital for the 12 months ending Q1 2024. This deployment includes M&A, mostly in our resilient businesses and a record level of co-investment commitments in REI. By thoughtfully using our balance sheet we made targeted opportunistic investments, while other investors have been largely on the sidelines. These investments have been underwritten at returns, well above our cost of capital. And specifically, our REI investments are projected to generate notably high returns. We also repurchased nearly 8 million shares in 2023 at a time when we believe they have been attractively valued. Our 2024 capital deployment will be supported by improved free cash flow, which we expect to total at least $1 billion, as certain headwinds reversed this year. As we've previously discussed, we had several large cash expenses in 2023 mostly timing-related items, such as cash variable compensation and cash income taxes tied to 2022 record results that did not flex down with last year's lower earnings. We estimate that the reversal of these items alone will drive a $500 million benefit to free cash flow compared with last year. Taking all of this into consideration, we expect to end 2024 with net leverage around one turn. Now I'll review our 2024 outlook on Slide 11. In the advisory segment, we expect net revenue to increase by mid- to high single-digits, with mid-teens SOP growth. The expected margin improvement reflects fixed cost leverage and the benefit of ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Advisory accounts for about two-thirds of the $150 million run rate cost savings initiative announced last quarter with half of the benefit being realized in 2024. These savings offset cost growth elsewhere in advisory this year notably from higher expected discretionary compensation tied to improved financial performance. We anticipate that capital markets revenue will grow by mid-single digits. Investor sentiment has improved in the last nine days, reflecting a better interest rate outlook. Real estate allocations are approaching target levels and this reflects an easing of the denominator effect, as public equity markets have rebounded while private relist values are being written down. We expect leasing to grow modestly in 2024. We are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over for office leasing, particularly for Class A properties, where we generate approximately two-thirds of leasing revenue. Leading indicators from our data partner VTS indicate US office demand has been gradually turning up over the last six months. The growing consensus about an economic soft landing coupled with the apparent stabilization of office utilization rates may make more employers confident enough to commit to office leases. Additionally, leasing demand should remain relatively strong for industrial deals particularly for properties under 500,000 square feet. Our remaining advisory business lines together are expected to achieve low double-digit net revenue growth. In the GWS segment, we expect mid-teen SOP growth including the expected partial year contribution from the J&J acquisition. Continued strong organic growth will be driven by broad demand across client sectors and geographies. The local business will lead growth in GWS expected to generate more than $200 million of operating profit as we benefit further from our investments in this business. Our enterprise business is also seeing strong demand from both mature sectors like financial services as well as newer adopters of outsourcing such as industrial, healthcare and life sciences companies. Within project management significant growth will be led by Turner & Townsend, which is in the early stages of penetrating the US. market. We anticipate seeing most of the revenue impact from our sizable Q4 wins in the second half of 2024 as new clients are onboarded. And even with the record level of conversions in Q4 our GWS pipeline ended 2023 10% higher than the prior year. Shifting to REI. We expect SOP in 2024 to be slightly below 2023's level. Note that last year's SOP included a single development portfolio sales, which generated more than $100 million of profit in Q1. In Investment Management, we expect operating profit to increase modestly from 2023 as stabilizing market conditions drive higher promote fees and improved co-investment returns. We expect development operating profit will be subdued this year as the projects we expect to monetize will be sold at higher cap rates than we underwrote at the peak of the prior market cycle. At current market cap rates we have hundreds of millions of dollars of operating profit embedded in our in-process portfolio and a pipeline of new opportunities with an attractive spread between our cost of development and current market value. On balance, we are cautiously optimistic about 2024. Our expectation of achieving core EPS of $4.25 to $4.65 is contingent on long-term interest rates remaining around current levels the Fed proceeding with the anticipated short-term rig cuts and the US economy avoiding a recession. This year's earnings are likely to be more heavily weighted than usual to the second half. The third and fourth quarters are expected to account for approximately two-thirds of our EPS while the first quarter will contribute a mid-teens percentage of the annual total. This distribution is similar to what we experienced in 2021 when we also had a second half recovery. We continue to see a path to returning to our prior core PS peak in 2025. That path is supported by continued double-digit growth in our resilient businesses and a gradual recovery in our transactional businesses. Importantly, CBRE can reach prior record earnings without our transactional businesses SOP rebounding to 2019 levels. With that operator, please open the line for questions. Yes, Tony. So, first to step back on our outlook just give context around the range, which I think will help get to the corporate and below the line items. If you look at our segment level guidance, I think, what you're seeing is that you likely get to an EPS that's slightly above the midpoint of our range. And what we baked into the midpoint of our EPS guidance is some level of conservatism, given that rates have continued to bubble especially in the past few weeks. So it's safe to assume on the corporate cost level the corporate segment level that is going uptick slightly, but not as much as your -- the number that you're looking at might imply. And the reason corporate will uptick slightly is because primarily, because our bonuses discretionary compensation will reset to levels that are in line with improved financial performance. And then I'll comment on the range of our outlook. The pieces that we have a high level of conviction around is our growth in our resilient SOP. We talked about that growing from $1.6 billion this year to $1.8 billion next year or 2024 and that's consistent across the range. And then our transactional business lines are clearly the ones that will move us towards the bottom end or the high end of the range depending on when the recovery begins. I'll primarily speak to J&J, we are expecting to get likely three quarters of the benefit of that acquisition in year and we talked about what the EBITDA we're expecting for J&J in our press release about $65 million for the year. It is safe to assume we'll get three quarters of that in the year. The remainder of the co-investments in REI will be weighted more towards 2025 and beyond those funds. Funds get launched and our developments get monetized. So what we've always talked about is a balance of M&A our investments -- our co-investments in REI and share buybacks, and we'll do buybacks to balance out the other two when we view our share price to be attractive. We really saw in Q4 is that we were anticipating our -- the announcement of our acquisition of J&J. That deal is delivering a return well above our cost of capital. It's more accretive than buybacks in our analysis. And so you're seeing a weight more towards M&A. And I expect that to continue this year. We -- our M&A pipeline is building. We're seeing a greater ability to transact sellers are more willing to meet our value expectations. So where we sit right now expect the balance to be towards M&A this year. But of course, if that changes we'll look to repurchase shares. So, on the advisory side, you should see improvement in our overall advisory margin in 2024, probably about 100 basis points. That's because of our cost reduction plans and obviously a recovery in our transactions business. In GWS, our margins should hover around NIM level and increased slightly. The J&J acquisition is slightly accretive to our margins. But this is a business as you know that we don't expect to see a step function change in our margin over time, it will gradually increase as we continue to differentiate that business. And then on the GSEs, we have embedded in our forecast pretty much OMSR being flat to slightly up this year. Sentiment that we're seeing from the agencies is that they will get closer to their cash this year. But we are being conservative in terms of what we're projecting for the year. So, slightly more positive than what you heard on the Walker & Dunlop. So, let's start with what we've been seeing over the past through 2023 and through the end of the year. And we did see a significant deceleration in the decline, especially getting into Q4. So, through the third quarter, you're looking at 40% decline up to that point. And then in the fourth quarter, we were down to below 20% decline. And what was notable about Q4 was that we actually saw a significant deceleration in December. So October, November had greater declines than December, which was in the single-digit decline in territory. So pulling that into 2024, we are not expecting a material uplift in capital markets activity, but we do expect it to grow at a mid single-digit rate globally. If the recovery picks up faster than we're expecting if rates come down further than the market is expecting then there could be upside from there. But our base case scenario is that there won't be a significant uplift. So there are cost savings embedded in our outlook, and where you will see the majority of it is within our advisory business, which I talked about earlier about 100 basis points of margin expansion in advisory. We talked about $150 million of run rate cost savings in -- on our Q3 call that we're going to go after this year. We have identified opportunities to reduce $150 million of run rate cost. You'll see about half of that in year and most of that will be in the advisory segment. A piece to note about that is those cost savings are largely offsetting our bonuses resetting and our discretionary compensation in our profit shares resetting to levels that are in line with our positive financial performance for the year, but it isn't embedded in numbers that you're seeing. So I want to be clear that we see a -- we have strong visibility into returning to our peak level of EPS in 2025. And that confidence has not declined since last quarter -- is at least equal to and potentially slightly above especially, if we achieve our expectations for 2024. And I can simply break down the components of how we'll get there between our Resilient SOP and our transactional SOP. Within our resilience line of business, like I said before, we expect $1.8 billion of SOP this year, that should continue to grow at least a 10% rate next year. And we have a high level of confidence in delivering that outcome. And then on the transactional side, we do not need our transactional SOPs to return anywhere near to peak levels of earnings like we did in 2022 and they don't even need to return to our level of transactional SOP in 2019. So hopefully, that puts some perspective on our ability to achieve that outcome. The main risk is that the recovery would get delayed this year and it would make that hurdle on the transactional side slightly higher next year. So overall, on our transactional business, our incremental margins are in the low to mid-30s. This is both across capital markets and leasing, and to put some more context around that a 5% change in leasing, results in a 3% delta in EPS. And on the sales side, a 5% change in sales would be a 2% change in EPS."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. CBRE ended 2023 on a high note with fourth quarter year-over-year operating profit growth across all three of our business segments. Even though 2023 was a difficult year for commercial real estate, we delivered the third highest full year earnings in CBRE's history as our resilient businesses continued their strong growth. This partly offset market-driven revenue declines in businesses that are sensitive to interest rates and debt availability. Emma will talk about our resilient businesses in greater detail at the beginning of her comments. We are committed to driving significant gains in all of our businesses with a particular focus on through-cycle resiliency and double-digit compound long-term earnings growth. Two recent wins highlight our progress. First, with the acquisition of J&J Worldwide Services and our GWS segment, we will increase our technical services capabilities for US federal government clients and open a mostly untapped channel in a difficult to penetrate market. This is a large market characterized by steady growth and long-term contracts. Second, our strategic partnership to provide property management services for Brookfield Properties, 65 million square foot US office portfolio is among the largest in the history of our sector. We believe there will be more opportunities of this nature, which we are well positioned to capture. We start 2024 with strong new business pipelines across our company. We also see attractive M&A and REI co-investment opportunities. Investor and lender sentiment has improved and we anticipate this will lead to increased transaction volumes, starting in the second half of the year when short-term interest rates are expected to fall. Against this backdrop, we expect to achieve core EPS of $4.25 to $4.65 in 2024, implying mid-teens percentage growth at the midpoint of the range. This broad range reflects the difficulty in predicting the precise timing of a recovery. It is notable that any outcome in this range would still be well below the long-term earnings potential of CBRE. With that, Emma will walk you through our results and outlook in more detail. I'll comment on the -- Jade on the Trammell Crow Company circumstance and then Emma can comment on the volumes, the financing volumes. We are taking on a steady stream of new land sites in Trammell Crow Company that we're underwriting at returns that we think based on current cap rates will be consistent with our historical returns in that business. This is one of the things that's really doesn't show up in any of our headlines that makes us excited about future profitability. It is true that there is some pressure in the multifamily markets based on the development that's happened over the last couple of years and the cost of leverage versus where those deals that yields those deals were developed at. We think that is going to be self-correcting over the next couple of years. New development volume is going to come down. We're still at barely above historic levels of vacancy. I think maybe 50 basis points above historic levels, about 550 basis points of vacancy versus 5% historically. We think that is going to correct. We think the circumstance in the single-family home market with the cost of mortgages is going to drive people towards renting. And so, we are quite bullish after we get through a little tough window here in the multifamily business on where that's going to go. We're bullish about what it means for Trammell Crow Company. We're bullish about what it means for our investment management business. And we think that the volumes in our services business will be good over time, but we are going to go through as you commented from the Walker & Dunlop call, there will be a window where it's a little more difficult. That's fully contemplated by the way in the numbers that Emma gave you about our expectations for 2024. Emma, you want to add to that? Well, it is the case that we think it has bottomed out. It obviously is below -- meaningfully below where it was occupancy is square footage per person is below where it was per employee is, below where it was in 2019. There is all kinds of anecdotal evidence around that issue, some stubbornness people coming back to the office. That's super clear. The other thing is there's just a clear amount of pressure from companies to get their people back into the office for all kinds of reasons. What we do know and I would say anecdotal evidence in this area is not just evidence it's an avalanche of evidence. Every company that you talk to, you can't talk to a corporate that would tell you that office building occupancy, either in buildings they own or building they lease is not important to their business. It's important to all of them. It's important to us in our business. And so what you're seeing is that people are redoing their space, trying to make it a better environment for their employees, make their employees more efficient, more engaged. Class A buildings that create that opportunity are seeing in a number of markets record rents. Buildings that aren't good are struggling and they're going to continue to struggle. So we look at that circumstance, and we say there's pressure on both sides, but we think it's kind of stabilized. We think it will be a very big asset class going forward, bigger than the headlines might suggest because people tend to like negative news. And in the real estate services business, as opposed to the real estate owning businesses and we're in both of them. It's going to be a very large opportunity for CBRE, and you saw that with the Brookfield situation that we announced. You see that with the growth in our outsourcing business. You're seeing it come through in our leasing numbers. So I think that you're going to see the future be better than the current circumstance has been for a variety of reasons. We're -- well, Jade, you're talking about the blurred lines between real estate and infrastructure and some regard. And in those areas data centers and so forth we do have meaningful exposure. The places where we have kind of traditionally defined infrastructure exposure or with the Turner & Townsend business where they provide a lot of program and project and cost consulting services to infrastructure-type projects and they are really well-positioned for the future in that regard. We have an infrastructure investment management business that we would like to scale over time. And then in Trammell Crow Company, we do a variety of development. There are some things we're working on that are quite large between Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend that would be in the infrastructure category. So, we believe over time we'll evolve to a place where we will do more work and invest more in infrastructure, but real estate is our core business for the time being. M&A work is a fundamental foundational element of what CBRE is about. We are committed across all of our lines of business to be a grower. We have built within our market-facing businesses capability to identify M&A opportunities in all of our businesses. We clearly have some places we're more interested in at any given point in time typically because they're secularly favored because we have more of a right to win but it is fundamental and if you look across our business, our people are in the market identifying opportunities at all times. We have built up our M&A capability in the center our corporate development capability to the point where we think it's quite unique within our sector and is relatively strong against the broader base of companies out there outside our sectors -- are outside our sector. We have a strong balance sheet and willingness to use that balance sheet to do M&A. So, you should expect us to continue to build the business through M&A. We aren't going to do deals that we aren't -- that we don't think are smart either financially or because they're hard to integrate or too hard to integrate. And it wasn't hard to watch us in the past year and say that maybe listening from quarter-to-quarter there was more going on than you were seeing where you saw the J&J deal at the end. There will be other things but we won't force M&A. We'll do M&A where we think we can grow our business the way we want to grow it into areas with secular tailwind, in the areas where we have the right to win and as Emma has said, it will likely be over the long-term our number one use of capital. Well, I'm going to start with cost. That is starting to come under control. We had challenges, everybody that was a developer in the United States and around the world had challenges with cost the last few years. Now that was all typically rescued by accelerating rental rates and declining cap rates, and we think all of that has stabilized. Cap rates have gone up. Rental rate growth has slowed, but cost growth has also come under control. So that's all come back into balance. We are underwriting projects now at spreads between current cap rates and yields on projects that should deliver profitability consistent with what has been delivered in that business historically. And I mentioned this earlier and I'll mention it again within that business over the last year we've secured good volume of development sites, not at steel prices but what's happened is sites that were otherwise not available have become available. And because many, many people are on the sidelines, many developers are on the sidelines, we have the CBRE parent company balance sheet available to us. We've been able to secure a good number of development opportunities with really good spreads between current cap rates and yields on the projects. So that out in the future, we think we're well positioned for that business. And in Emma's comments, you might have noticed that she said, we've got hundreds of millions of dollars of profits captured in that in-process and pipeline portfolio development deals. We're quite excited about that. Thanks very much, everyone, and we look forward to connecting with you again in 90 days."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brad Burke, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you, Mr. Burke. You may begin.\nBrad Burke: Good morning, everyone and welcome to CBRE\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks and an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Before we kick off today\u2019s call, I will remind you that today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements concerning our economic outlook, our business plans and our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our SEC filings. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. I am joined on today\u2019s call by Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now, please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Commercial real estate capital markets remained under significant pressure in the third quarter. As a result, we experienced a sustained slowdown in property sales and debt financing activity, which drove the decline in core EPS. This decline was exacerbated by delays in harvesting development assets, which we will sell when market conditions improve. Over the last several quarters, we have detailed the increased importance of our resilient and secularly favored businesses. These businesses saw continued solid growth in the third quarter, led by Global Workplace Solutions. Interest rates have increased more than 100 basis points since we reported second quarter results 90 days ago, continuing the sharpest rise in rates in nearly 40 years. The unexpected jump in rates has pushed back the capital markets recovery. Property prices are gradually declining and we believe this process won\u2019t complete and transaction activity won\u2019t rebound materially until investors are confident that interest rates have peaked and credit becomes readily available. We now believe this rebound is unlikely to occur until the second half of next year at the earliest. In the meantime, as we discussed last quarter, pockets of opportunity exists and the breadth and depth of our market presence gives us visibility into where we want to be positioned for the long-term. For example, year-to-date, we have committed more than $350 million in co-investments to value-add opportunistic and development strategies and believe these investments are positioned to deliver quite attractive returns as market conditions improve. This is the time in the market cycle when well-positioned investors can secure opportunities that deliver outsized returns. We expect to identify and act on more opportunities to deploy capital, especially in co-investments in M&A while the market is depressed. In light of continuing challenges, in the real estate capital markets, we have lowered our expectations for 2023 core EPS to a mid-30% decrease from the 20% to 25% decline we anticipated 90 days ago. The reduced outlook is almost entirely attributable to our interest rate sensitive businesses. While it\u2019s difficult to forecast the timing of the capital markets recovery, the resilient and secularly favored businesses we mentioned earlier have generated over $1.5 billion of SOP over the last 12 months and we expect them to represent over 60% of CBRE\u2019s SOP for full year 2023. We further expect SOP from these businesses to increase by double digits next year. Emma will walk you through our outlook after she reviews the quarter. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of Advisory Services results. This segment\u2019s net revenue fell 17% and SOP declined to 35% versus the prior year\u2019s Q3. Across geographies, APAC showed the best relative performance with revenue up 3% led by continued strong growth in Japan. Revenue was weak across EMEA declining 18%, slightly better than the Americas, where revenue fell 21%. The revenue decline was most pronounced in property sales, which decreased 38% with both fires and sellers pausing amid the sharp and unexpected interest rate increases over the past 90 days. EMEA sales revenues saw the greatest decline at 47%, while APAC sales revenue fell only 12%. In the Americas, property sales revenue dropped 41%. Ironically, compared with other major property types, office saw the least severe decline due to weak prior year comps and seller capitulation. Industrial sales were largely limited to properties under 300,000 square feet and multifamily sales were concentrated in core and core+ properties as investors focus on the highest quality properties to mitigate risk. Commercial mortgage origination revenue fell less than property sales, down 18%. The decline was tempered by our significant business with the GSEs, which have taken share amidst the broader pullback in lending. Beyond Capital Markets, our leasing revenue declined by 16%, a few percentage points below what we had anticipated going into the quarter. Significant growth in several APAC countries was offset by lower revenue in both EMEA and the Americas. Economic uncertainty continues to delay occupier decision-making, particularly for large office and industrial deals. For example, leasing revenue declined by 23% in the U.S., but the number of leases completed was only down 10%. The remaining lines of business in our advisory segment were relatively flat with growth in both loan servicing and property management, offsetting weaker valuations revenue, which is tied to sales and financing activity. Please turn to Slide 7 as I discuss the GWS segment. GWS posted another strong quarter with net revenue and SOP increasing by 14% and 15%, respectively. Both facilities management and project management generated mid-teens net revenue growth. Our business continues to benefit from our focus on industry sectors that allow us to meet the unique needs of our diversified client base. Growth year-to-date has been notable in 3 sectors. Health care due to our enhanced capabilities to meet client needs, energy spurred by strong expansion with existing clients, along with growth in renewable energy, an industrial logistics, an industry that is increasingly embracing outsourcing in their manufacturing plants to reduce costs. We are also seeing continued strong revenue growth in our GWS local business driven by a mix of new and existing clients. Investment in our U.S. local business, which I discussed last quarter, resulted in several new wins and accelerated revenue growth. In addition, our Turner & Townsend project management business continues to outperform expectations, most notably through their expansion in the U.S. Our GWS pipeline reached a new record in the quarter, with one-third of our pipeline coming from first-generation outsourcing clients. That is clients who have not previously outsourced their real estate operations. The growth in first-generation pursuits reflects corporation\u2019s increased interest in reducing occupancy costs amid the uncertain economic environment. Our remaining pipeline is filled with occupiers that are looking to either expand their scope of services with CBRE or switched their service provider to CBRE because of our ability to provide more integrated global solutions. Margins improved slightly in Q3 due to strong revenue growth that offset the investments made earlier this year, allowing us to achieve operating leverage. We anticipate further margin expansion next quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of the REI segment. Overall SOP totaled just $7 million, reflecting few U.S. development asset sales and lower operating profit in our Investment Management business. Within Investment Management, the decline in operating profit was primarily driven by negative marks in our more than $330 million co-investment portfolio compared with positive marks last year as well as lower incentive fees. AUM declined sequentially to $144 billion, primarily due to lower property valuations and negative foreign currency effects, which offset modest net inflows. While fundraising has decelerated materially across the sector, including for CBRE, investors remain keenly interested in higher target return strategies to take advantage of current market stress and dislocation such as opportunistic secondaries and value-add real estate strategies. And we have committed almost $200 million year-to-date in co-investment capital in support of these strategies. This is a record level of co-investment across our funds and a substantial increase in our commitment to higher return strategies. We have focused on follow-on funds with strong track record and led by experienced portfolio management teams. Development results were below expectations due to deals slipping into 2024. Historically, we\u2019ve covered the U.S. development business\u2019s operating costs with project fees, and we expect this to be the case going forward. Our in-process portfolio was flat with last quarter as we added a few new projects, but also did not have any meaningful asset sales. Note that we have refined our development portfolio definition to better reflect projects that are actively under construction. The primary change is that the definition of in-process now only includes projects that have started construction, whereas the prior definition included projects that are under our control with construction expected to start within 12 months. The environment for harvesting development projects and recognizing the related gains has become increasingly challenging. The project sale process is progressing more slowly than we typically see, driven by increased caution from buyers. This has been elongating the sale process rather than impacting pricing. However, we are reaching a point where pricing will be impacted. And in that case, we will proactively decide to hold well-capitalized assets until market conditions improve. As Bob noted earlier, these circumstances, which put downward pressure on our business in the short-run, create opportunities to secure assets that will lead to substantial future profits. Looking forward, we have continued to invest in development with more than $150 million committed year-to-date. These investments are focused on securing multifamily and industrial projects at a time of capital market dislocation that we expect to deliver historically attractive returns. Please turn to Slide 9. As we\u2019ve noted, the current environment is providing opportunities to deploy capital strategically. With respect to M&A, we continue to evaluate many opportunities across our lines of business. However, we are being disciplined about pricing and thorough in our due diligence. Just as the rise in interest rates and increased uncertainty impacts real estate transactions, it also affects M&A deals. We have passed on otherwise attractive deals where we could not close the gap in pricing with sellers. Our total rates to achieve returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital have increased along with interest rates. The seller pricing expectations for the most part have adjusted more slowly. In the meantime, we completed over $500 million of share repurchases during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $630 million. Volatility during the third quarter allowed us to get close to our share repurchase target for the full year. I want to reiterate that while we are looking to take advantage of this period of investment opportunity, we remain highly disciplined around pricing, and we are fully committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet with a leverage ratio below 2 turns. Next, I\u2019ll briefly touch on cash flow and cost reductions. Full year free cash flow is tracking below our prior expectations primarily due to lower earnings. In addition, several large uses of cash, mostly timing-related items such as cash compensation tied to last year\u2019s results do not flex down with this year\u2019s lower earnings. As a result, these items are a headwind to free cash flow this year. As these timing impacts reverse next year, we anticipate a significant improvement in our 2024 free cash flow generation. We discussed earlier this year that we were prepared to cut costs further if the market environment deteriorated. That time has come, and we will be reducing costs across our lines of business. We have already targeted $150 million of reductions in our run rate operating costs, primarily focused on our transactional lines of business that have been most negatively impacted by the market downturn. We expect to provide more detail on the benefit of our cost savings actions when we provide 2024 guidance next quarter. Turning to our outlook. As Bob noted earlier, we now expect core EPS for the full year to decline by mid-30%. Our expectations for double-digit revenue and SOP growth in our GWS segment are more than offset by capital markets-driven SOP declines in advisory and REI segments. Looking to next year, while the recovery of transaction activity, particularly in capital markets, will take longer than initially anticipated, we expect double-digit growth of our resilient and secularly favored lines of business, which combined have exceeded $1.5 billion of SOP on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we will continue to benefit from strategic deployment of capital and our cost reduction initiatives. Taking into account all of these circumstances, we believe this year will be the trough for our earnings and anticipate meaningful growth next year. However, our return to record earnings will likely be delayed a year relative to our earlier expectations. With that, operator, we\u2019ll open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. Thank you, and good morning. My first question relates to leasing and the hesitancy by occupiers to make some decisions there, dial down just the size of deals. Do you think that\u2019s on the front end at this point? Where that hesitancy is just starting? Or do you think that\u2019s been happening for a while now? I\u2019m trying to get a sense as to how we should think about leasing as we look at the next few quarters?\nBob Sulentic: Tony, it\u2019s been happening for a while. It\u2019s become a little more pronounced, and we think it\u2019s going to go into next year. What\u2019s causing it is we don\u2019t have a recession. Everybody knows that we don\u2019t have the kind of financial problems we\u2019ve had in prior cycles. But we have a lot of uncertainty, and we have uncertainty around the cost of capital, which causes companies of all types to be careful about their expenditures that would run through their income statement. Of course, the minute that happens, they are cautious about leasing. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to become materially more pronounced than it is now. And as we\u2019ve said, we think now when we get to the back half of next year, things will recover. That\u2019s where we are. I think what\u2019s notable is to slow down on behalf of big absorbers of industrial space. We went through an extended period where not only were they taking space to support their growth, some of them were taking space to hedge against future growth. They are now burning through that space. And when that\u2019s done, we will start to see leasing come back by those big industrial users. It is notable that we still only have 4% vacancy in industrial space. So they\u2019ll get back to being careful to make sure they have adequate inventory.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, thanks. And then you called out investment management as a focus area on the M&A side. Are you seeing specific deals that are making more sense there or is that just an area that thematically like?\nEmma Giamartino: I think Tony, you\u2019re talking about maybe prior remarks that we made. We\u2019re looking broad-based across the company at M&A, and we\u2019ve been focused on the areas of our business that are resilient and cyclery favored. Those are the types of larger deals we\u2019ve done in the past, and those are the types of deals that we\u2019re looking at now. One of the things that\u2019s happening right now is we are looking at a number of deals, and we\u2019ve talked about deals on the larger end of the range that we\u2019ve typically looked at in the past or we\u2019ve typically executed in the past. But pricing has become more of a challenge than it was a year ago or even 6 months ago, similar to what\u2019s happening in the real estate market with the gap between buyer and seller valuation remaining higher even increasing as interest rates are increasing. A similar impact is happening to M&A. So for us, our cost of capital is increasing slightly. Our risk appetite is reducing slightly. And so we need seller prices to come down for us to be able to execute some of these deals \u2013 many of these deals.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just Emma, one last clarifying item, if I can. Did you mention you thought the recurring businesses like GWS were going to grow double digits in \u201824? Or was that just for \u201823? I didn\u2019t catch that.\nEmma Giamartino: We expect our resilient lines of business in aggregate, which for the year to generate $1.6 billion of SOP to grow in the low double-digit range going forward into the future. And GWS specifically, that SOP for this year is going to grow in the mid-double-digit range, so low teens range and should continue going forward.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. So you feel comfortable with that double-digit number around GWS, for instance, for \u201824 as well?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, absolutely.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Emma, I just on the share buybacks. I know in the last call, you had talked, I think about doing $600 million, you guys did a little north of $500 million this quarter. So I guess, are you still sticking with that $600 million number for the back half kind of implying a fairly low fourth quarter number? I know that kind of ties in maybe with lack or less free cash flow. So just any thoughts around buybacks for the rest of the year?\nEmma Giamartino: Steve, that\u2019s the right way to think about it. We were going into the latter half of the year, our expectation was for $600 million. As you said, we did $500 million in this quarter. So we are on track to deliver the same amount we were thinking last quarter.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And look, I know everybody is highly focused on the sales environment that really seems to kind of be the linchpin for the company. Bob, you\u2019ve obviously talked about maybe a second half recovery. Just sort of trying to think through kind of the timing? And is it more the economy that you think is driving people uncertainty? Is it the absolute level of interest rates? Is it the fact that the banks and insurance companies aren\u2019t really lending money. I know all of it impacts it. But is there one factor that you think is more pronounced than another?\nBob Sulentic: Uncertainty around interest rates is one really prominent fact and the expectation that they are now going to come down later than we previously thought. Number two, there is still a view that values are going to come down some that private privately held assets haven\u2019t come into line yet and maybe another 5% to 10% decline in asset values. But Steve, I really think it\u2019s important to remember this about our business. Those assets are real, and they are held by investors, and there is buyers with massive amounts of capital. Waiting to make trades when those two things sort out, we will get back to an active trading environment. It\u2019s not like some things that go away and never come back, right? The assets are there. The base of assets is actually growing and the people that hold the assets, there is a significant number of them and a significant volume of them that want to trade those assets with buyers ready to go. And buyers are watching closely the interest rates and watching closely the valuations and things are starting to come in-line to the point where we think there will be trading again in the second half of next year.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then one just small technical one. I guess we noticed that the tax rate in the quarter came in much lower than expected. I think that might have helped kind of EPS. Just kind of what are your thoughts and what drove that in the quarter? And I guess is that sort of a sustainable lower tax rate? Or is that more of a one-off issue in the quarter?\nEmma Giamartino: That is a one-time tax planning benefit that we had this quarter. For the full year, we\u2019re expecting our tax rate to come in at about 21%. And excluding that benefit this quarter, our tax rate is about 20% in Q3.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. On leasing, if new tenants are taking 10% to 20% less space, and there is some pressure on net effective rents on the office side as well as the overall uncertainty around demand for office space. And then you mentioned some of the slowdown in industrial and then I would characterize retailers mixed. Do you think that leasing would be negative in 2024?\nBob Sulentic: It\u2019s \u2013 it could be in some areas, Jade, but we think that what\u2019s going on with office space has kind of settled out, right? Rates have come way down, users of office space have backed off, people that want premium office space for the experience side of things for their employees are going after it and we think they\u2019ll continue to go after it into next year. We think industrial has slowed down for a time being. It will come back to the back half of next year, and I think you commented already, retail\u2019s mixed. But there is a lot of retail activity in the economy now, and there is reason to believe that, that will kind of sustain the way it is now.\nJade Rahmani: And then on GWS. I understand the long-term opportunity and gaining the penetration rate by passing on cost savings to those that don\u2019t currently outsource. But there are friction costs associated with this as well as execution complexity and uncertainty. Would not the macro backdrop create headwinds in GWS as well and thereby put some pressure on the double-digit growth. I mean, if the economy is slowing down, it seems that business\u2019s double-digit growth profile could be at risk. Could you give some reasons why that\u2019s not the case?\nBob Sulentic: Well, when the economy slows down, the company\u2019s focus intensely on cost. And when they focus on cost, they think about having somebody like us, us more than anybody else handle their real estate facilities for them because we save them money. That is an absolute front and center dimension of that business. Where you see things slow down is capital expenditures, which can hit project management, but there is so much momentum around various parts of our project management business related to enhancing the experience for clients in the office space that companies have, which is a big deal for them now, and we think that\u2019s going to continue to be a big deal. We think that will offset the focus on reducing capital expenditures. Also, that project management business, as you know, does a lot of stuff in the infrastructure, green energy, etcetera, areas. And so we think that there is offsetting factors there that will allow that business to continue to grow to double-digit rates. So the bottom line is, I don\u2019t think what we\u2019re seeing in the economy and the uncertainty in the economy would push that down below being a double-digit grower next year.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. Finally, just on REI, have you changed series underwriting toward the capitalization and acquisition of new projects to account for potentially rates remaining at current levels? And does the outlook for asset sales depend more on timing or a moderation in interest rates in order to refinance those deals and sell at attractive cap rates.\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Our underwriting that we do across our REI business for the acquisition of existing assets and for the investment in the co-investment and development deals is all driven by interest rates that we think will be available to us when we capitalize those projects. It\u2019s \u2013 there is great attention paid to that and a lot of study around that by our research people and Chief Economist office, etcetera. So what\u2019s in those underwritings is reflective of that view. What\u2019s going to \u2013 we commented a little earlier, what\u2019s going to drive the sale of assets is the stabilization or decline in interest rates and the general view that values have bottomed out. And again, we now think that timing is second half of next year. And we do think prices are going to come down a bit more, maybe as much as 10%.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you for taking the questions.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Sheldon: Hey, good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask another question on the advisory leasing side. Curious how different the revenue trends may look between office versus industrial is one side they are holding up better than the others as we think about growth so far this year and then maybe how you\u2019re thinking about it heading into the next year.\nEmma Giamartino: So office leasing this year has been performing in-line with our expectations. There has been some we noted some drop-off in the larger office deals, but we were anticipating decline a mid-15% decline across office leasing. On the industrial side, that is \u2013 industrial leasing is performing slightly below expectations. But as Bob alluded to, that is primarily driven by the largest industrial transactions and the largest occupiers of industrial space who took on a lot of space over the past couple of years and are resetting. We don\u2019t expect that to be a continued trend going into next year. And in terms of mix, I think our leasing has grown. Industrial has grown as a percentage of our overall leasing and offices declined, but that isn\u2019t out of what we were expecting going into the year and into the quarter.\nStephen Sheldon: Okay. Great, thank you. And then just on capital, if I \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re ramping investments into IM in development. So can you give more detail on the opportunities you\u2019re seeing there and why this could be the right time to make those investments?\nBob Sulentic: Well, this \u2013 what typically happens in an environment like this and what is definitively happening now on the development side, where the investments we make are largely acquiring land for future development. Landholders often landholders that bought that land to develop it, you can\u2019t develop it because they can\u2019t get the capital to develop it or they don\u2019t have the capital themselves to make the co-investment needed to develop it. And so good land sites that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been available become available. And because of our position in two ways, our balance sheet, plus the stable of really strong developers we have in local markets. We identify opportunities of this nature. We\u2019re in the market all the time, up and down cycles. We know the land sites that are good. We know the land sites that we would have liked to have gotten that we didn\u2019t get. And what we do is we go back because we now have the capital to take those land sites down, we go back and try to secure some of those sites. And cycle after cycle, what you see is that it\u2019s the acquisition of those land sites and the development deals that result from those land sites that become your best profit deals. And as Emma said earlier, we\u2019re focused on multifamily and industrial there. On the investment management side, we think this is a good point in the cycle to look at value add and opportunistic. So, we have an opportunistic fund run out of the UK that\u2019s got a very, very strong track record that we have made a significant commitment to with our own balance sheet to raise the next fund to do investments in real estate secondaries and we are very excited about that opportunity. And then we have three value-add businesses, one in each region of the world U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific, all of which were providing co-investment to do our next fund in, all of which we see lots of opportunity in. So, that\u2019s our co-investment strategy. That\u2019s what \u2013 when we talk about $370 million year-to-date, that\u2019s where we have invested. And we are well positioned to continue to invest.\nStephen Sheldon: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey. Good morning. What are you hearing from asset owners in terms of allocating capital towards commercial real estate in a higher interest rate world as opposed to allocating capital towards asset classes would perceive lower risk?\nBob Sulentic: Well, there is \u2013 clearly, there is movement into cash and cash return \u2013 you can get returns on that, that you couldn\u2019t get previously, so secured debt, etcetera. There is no doubt that, that dynamic is at play in what\u2019s going on with the non-traded REITs, etcetera and core assets. But people are ready to get back into real estate when things sort out. There is just no doubt about it. The amount of capital that\u2019s on the sidelines that wants to get into commercial real estate is enormous. And what\u2019s going to have to happen as we said, is interest rates are going to have to stabilize and the belief that valuations have come down is going to have to be there. There is an increasing interest, and I just walked through what we are doing on the development side and opportunistic investment side. There is an increased interest in people getting into those areas that have a longer horizon for returns on their capital and have a higher risk appetite. And there is always, of course a big chunk of capital with that orientation. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Got it. Helpful. Thank you. And then circling back to your earlier comments on leasing, so if I am understanding it correctly, your view is that even if there is an economic slowdown in 2024, there is really little incremental downside risk to leasing revenues going forward?\nEmma Giamartino: There is potentially some, but we are not expecting the decline next year to be greater than what we saw this year. And I think what\u2019s important to note, we provided some high-level remarks around what we are expecting over the next couple of years. And that\u2019s not to provide any sort of guidance around what we will expect because we all know that it\u2019s very difficult to anticipate how the broader external factors will impact the company. But to put context around it, we are very confident that our GWS business will continue to deliver double-digit growth. And if it delivers double-digit SOP growth over the next couple of years, and the remainder of our segments remained flat in 2024 and get back to \u2013 don\u2019t even need to get back to 2019 levels of earnings, we will get back to our record levels of EPS. So, in terms of leasing, I just want to emphasize that even if there is a slight decline next year, we still have a path to growth over the next 2 years.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey. Good morning everyone. Maybe starting with a little bit of a housekeeping question. But am I \u2013 I think this quarter, you didn\u2019t give any specific outlook anymore for \u2013 by segment. So, given how important the fourth quarter is maybe you can give us a little bit more color in terms of the various business lines of what we should be expecting? I know it\u2019s kind of implied, but more color would be appreciated.\nEmma Giamartino: Okay. So, for the full year, we are expecting within GWS that our SOP growth will be in line with that low-double digit that we have been talking about throughout the year. Advisory overall will be down about in the 30% range. And then REI, as you know is down a little over 50% for the full year. In terms of what\u2019s guided our reduced outlook from what we said in Q2 to what we are seeing now from that 20% to 25% EPS decline down to a mid-30s decline. About a third of that is related to capital markets and about a third is related to development and the remainder is men across the rest of the business.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. Great. And then secondly, maybe this is a quick one because I think you just addressed this when you asked Patrick\u2019s question, but thinking about the multiyear outlook again. And maybe I am stating the obvious, but like \u2013 if I look at my numbers, to get to 2025 record year, basically, if you grow in GWS and you maybe get more aggressive on the buybacks? Like \u2013 and then potentially in the transactional businesses, if you just grab a little bit of market share, even if this environment stays like this, you could get to a record. I mean is that what you were just trying to say, I mean maybe just state me obviously again.\nEmma Giamartino: Absolutely. That \u2013 and that is the point that we are trying to get across is that there is a reasonable path to getting back to record, and we are not anticipating a sharp recovery, especially not next year, and we don\u2019t require a sharp recovery in 2025 to get to that record level. Again, our resilient and cycle favorite lines of business, which include GWS but also includes property management, the recurring elements of our investment management fees, valuations in loan servicing, not in aggregate is $1.6 billion of SOP. So, that growing at low-double digits over the next 2 years will create meaningful value. And then, again, our transactional lines of business, so development, the portion of investment management that is more transactional loan service \u2013 loan origination and sales origination. Those elements only need to get back to just shy of 2019 levels for us to get to record earnings.\nAlex Kramm: Excellent. Thanks for clarifying. And then just maybe one quick one. On the GWS business, you called out these first-time outsourcers, I guess. Can you just talk about how the sales cycle differs there because I think it\u2019s a meaningful part of the pipeline now? And then overall, can you just remind us when you think about the white space here, how big the first time outsource opportunity is in the context of the size of your business? I mean is there still a very meaningful TAM of companies that really have never outsourced before.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. So, in your first question, our pipeline across GWS and that includes both facilities management and project management is it continues to be at record levels. We have a large and growing pipeline. It\u2019s split between about 50% new clients and 50% existing clients. And of those new clients, about half of those are first-generation clients. So, about a third of our overall pipeline is first-generation outsourcers. But the important part is that our overall pipeline is building. And yes, those first-generation outsourcers take longer, the sales cycle is longer to convert them over to outsourcing, but it\u2019s a huge opportunity and it\u2019s a growing opportunity and it is building our pipeline. To your second question around what the opportunity is, it\u2019s hard to accurately estimate it, but we believe that only 30% of the overall market is outsourced today. So, there is 70% of white space.\nAlex Kramm: Fantastic. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Griffin: Great. Thanks. Wondering if you can comment on CBRE\u2019s view of the macro and kind of how that might have shifted and in turn, kind of shifted your outlook kind of heading into 2024, if at all possible?\nBob Sulentic: Well, we \u2013 the biggest thing, Michael, that\u2019s shifted in our view is that it\u2019s going to take longer for interest rates to come down. It\u2019s going to take longer for debt, in particular, to become available for real estate \u2013 commercial real estate transactions. And as a result, transactions are not going to return until the back half of next year, where we thought they were going to return late this year, early next year. Secondly, we have introduced this notion that we are seeing, particularly with industrial tenants that the uncertainty is just causing them to pause, and we think that\u2019s going to go through the first half of next year. But we really don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a big deal because they are burning through inventories of space that they took down for defensive purposes, I guess for lack of a better term. And so that\u2019s what we see where if you were to sum it all up, the recovery that we thought would start towards the end of this year, we now think is going to start six or so months later, maybe a little longer. And for us, that pushes back our assumptions about the return to peak earnings a year or so into the following year.\nMichael Griffin: That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the advisory business. I know you called out Japan and APAC as a relative outperformer compared to Americas or EMEA. But was there any other drivers that led APAC to be pretty notable outperformer this quarter?\nBob Sulentic: For us specifically, we just have a very good business in Japan. And it\u2019s \u2013 obviously, that\u2019s a huge economy and Tokyo is a huge real estate market. And over the years, we \u2013 there has been a struggle around the notion of intermediation there. There was a lot of business done directly by buyer and seller, tenant, landlord, etcetera. That intermediation has become more accepted. There has also been a struggle to have non-Japanese domestic companies in the mix, so to speak. And that is \u2013 as it relates to being the designated intermediate \u2013 when intermediation happens and also being a home for talent. We have really changed our profile as a recruiter there over the last few years. And we have really changed our profile over there the last few years as somebody that\u2019s a recognized intermediary. As a result, we used to talk about, well, we have got good growth in Asia, but good growth on bases of business that weren\u2019t that needle moving to our overall results. Japan is now our second most profitable market in the world behind the United States for advisory business. So, when Japan does relatively well as it\u2019s doing now, you get the results we are getting. It\u2019s big enough to be needle moving for us. And then in general, as you know, the return to the office across Asia and Pacific is ahead of where it is in either the United States or EMEA.\nMichael Griffin: Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. On the M&A front, would you confirm that investment management is the key focus? And would you also be able to provide an updated comment as to how infrastructure fits in your overall strategic framework if you see this potentially emerging as a new business line alongside your others and potentially an additional diversifier?\nBob Sulentic: Jade, in terms of M&A, we \u2013 Emma made this comment. We look across our whole business. We have a very capable corporate development team that partners up with a group of geographic and business line leaders across the whole business around the world and across our lines of business to seek out M&A opportunities where we think we can enhance our offering to our clients. We just \u2013 you just saw today, we announced something in the \u2013 for our capital markets business in the investment banking capital advisors area. That was an area where we thought we had a bit of a hole. We went out and brought on a business that was very substantial global and additive. Lots of areas of interest, investment management has been an area of interest for us, but sole of others. We have several areas of interest in our GWS business. We have select areas of interest in our advisory business. We even have some areas we are looking at in the development business. But one of the things that\u2019s going on right now, and Emma mentioned this, is that pricing for M&A has not moved quite as quickly as we hoped or thought it would. And we are just showing a lot of \u2013 excuse me, a lot of discipline around what we are going to do in terms of acquiring other companies. We are just simply not going to pay prices that we think are unreasonable just to get businesses that we like. We think pricing is going to come into line. We see some signs of that. We have got a pipeline across those businesses and geographies that we like, but we are being disciplined. As it relates to infrastructure, there is two areas of our business where we are active with infrastructure. We have a nice size infrastructure investment management business. It\u2019s small relative to our overall investment management business, but it\u2019s in the upper-single digits in terms of billions of dollars of AUM, and we are looking for opportunities to grow that because we think it\u2019s got great long-term secular profile. The other place where we have a very significant infrastructure business is with the Turner & Townsend acquisition. They do a lot of infrastructure, program management, cost consultancy and project management. And they are well positioned \u2013 they are very well positioned in geographies around the world where that work is going on. They do a decent amount of work and a significantly growing amount of work as it relates to sustainability. So, we have a pretty strong infrastructure profile with them.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Bob Sulentic for closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks everyone and we look forward to getting back together with you when we announce our year-end earnings.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of Advisory Services results. This segment's net revenue fell 17% and SOP declined to 35% versus the prior year's Q3. Across geographies, APAC showed the best relative performance with revenue up 3% led by continued strong growth in Japan. Revenue was weak across EMEA declining 18%, slightly better than the Americas, where revenue fell 21%. The revenue decline was most pronounced in property sales, which decreased 38% with both fires and sellers pausing amid the sharp and unexpected interest rate increases over the past 90 days. EMEA sales revenues saw the greatest decline at 47%, while APAC sales revenue fell only 12%. In the Americas, property sales revenue dropped 41%. Ironically, compared with other major property types, office saw the least severe decline due to weak prior year comps and seller capitulation. Industrial sales were largely limited to properties under 300,000 square feet and multifamily sales were concentrated in core and core+ properties as investors focus on the highest quality properties to mitigate risk. Commercial mortgage origination revenue fell less than property sales, down 18%. The decline was tempered by our significant business with the GSEs, which have taken share amidst the broader pullback in lending. Beyond Capital Markets, our leasing revenue declined by 16%, a few percentage points below what we had anticipated going into the quarter. Significant growth in several APAC countries was offset by lower revenue in both EMEA and the Americas. Economic uncertainty continues to delay occupier decision-making, particularly for large office and industrial deals. For example, leasing revenue declined by 23% in the U.S., but the number of leases completed was only down 10%. The remaining lines of business in our advisory segment were relatively flat with growth in both loan servicing and property management, offsetting weaker valuations revenue, which is tied to sales and financing activity. Please turn to Slide 7 as I discuss the GWS segment. GWS posted another strong quarter with net revenue and SOP increasing by 14% and 15%, respectively. Both facilities management and project management generated mid-teens net revenue growth. Our business continues to benefit from our focus on industry sectors that allow us to meet the unique needs of our diversified client base. Growth year-to-date has been notable in 3 sectors. Health care due to our enhanced capabilities to meet client needs, energy spurred by strong expansion with existing clients, along with growth in renewable energy, an industrial logistics, an industry that is increasingly embracing outsourcing in their manufacturing plants to reduce costs. We are also seeing continued strong revenue growth in our GWS local business driven by a mix of new and existing clients. Investment in our U.S. local business, which I discussed last quarter, resulted in several new wins and accelerated revenue growth. In addition, our Turner & Townsend project management business continues to outperform expectations, most notably through their expansion in the U.S. Our GWS pipeline reached a new record in the quarter, with one-third of our pipeline coming from first-generation outsourcing clients. That is clients who have not previously outsourced their real estate operations. The growth in first-generation pursuits reflects corporation's increased interest in reducing occupancy costs amid the uncertain economic environment. Our remaining pipeline is filled with occupiers that are looking to either expand their scope of services with CBRE or switched their service provider to CBRE because of our ability to provide more integrated global solutions. Margins improved slightly in Q3 due to strong revenue growth that offset the investments made earlier this year, allowing us to achieve operating leverage. We anticipate further margin expansion next quarter. Now I'll turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of the REI segment. Overall SOP totaled just $7 million, reflecting few U.S. development asset sales and lower operating profit in our Investment Management business. Within Investment Management, the decline in operating profit was primarily driven by negative marks in our more than $330 million co-investment portfolio compared with positive marks last year as well as lower incentive fees. AUM declined sequentially to $144 billion, primarily due to lower property valuations and negative foreign currency effects, which offset modest net inflows. While fundraising has decelerated materially across the sector, including for CBRE, investors remain keenly interested in higher target return strategies to take advantage of current market stress and dislocation such as opportunistic secondaries and value-add real estate strategies. And we have committed almost $200 million year-to-date in co-investment capital in support of these strategies. This is a record level of co-investment across our funds and a substantial increase in our commitment to higher return strategies. We have focused on follow-on funds with strong track record and led by experienced portfolio management teams. Development results were below expectations due to deals slipping into 2024. Historically, we've covered the U.S. development business's operating costs with project fees, and we expect this to be the case going forward. Our in-process portfolio was flat with last quarter as we added a few new projects, but also did not have any meaningful asset sales. Note that we have refined our development portfolio definition to better reflect projects that are actively under construction. The primary change is that the definition of in-process now only includes projects that have started construction, whereas the prior definition included projects that are under our control with construction expected to start within 12 months. The environment for harvesting development projects and recognizing the related gains has become increasingly challenging. The project sale process is progressing more slowly than we typically see, driven by increased caution from buyers. This has been elongating the sale process rather than impacting pricing. However, we are reaching a point where pricing will be impacted. And in that case, we will proactively decide to hold well-capitalized assets until market conditions improve. As Bob noted earlier, these circumstances, which put downward pressure on our business in the short-run, create opportunities to secure assets that will lead to substantial future profits. Looking forward, we have continued to invest in development with more than $150 million committed year-to-date. These investments are focused on securing multifamily and industrial projects at a time of capital market dislocation that we expect to deliver historically attractive returns. Please turn to Slide 9. As we've noted, the current environment is providing opportunities to deploy capital strategically. With respect to M&A, we continue to evaluate many opportunities across our lines of business. However, we are being disciplined about pricing and thorough in our due diligence. Just as the rise in interest rates and increased uncertainty impacts real estate transactions, it also affects M&A deals. We have passed on otherwise attractive deals where we could not close the gap in pricing with sellers. Our total rates to achieve returns above our risk-adjusted cost of capital have increased along with interest rates. The seller pricing expectations for the most part have adjusted more slowly. In the meantime, we completed over $500 million of share repurchases during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $630 million. Volatility during the third quarter allowed us to get close to our share repurchase target for the full year. I want to reiterate that while we are looking to take advantage of this period of investment opportunity, we remain highly disciplined around pricing, and we are fully committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet with a leverage ratio below 2 turns. Next, I'll briefly touch on cash flow and cost reductions. Full year free cash flow is tracking below our prior expectations primarily due to lower earnings. In addition, several large uses of cash, mostly timing-related items such as cash compensation tied to last year's results do not flex down with this year's lower earnings. As a result, these items are a headwind to free cash flow this year. As these timing impacts reverse next year, we anticipate a significant improvement in our 2024 free cash flow generation. We discussed earlier this year that we were prepared to cut costs further if the market environment deteriorated. That time has come, and we will be reducing costs across our lines of business. We have already targeted $150 million of reductions in our run rate operating costs, primarily focused on our transactional lines of business that have been most negatively impacted by the market downturn. We expect to provide more detail on the benefit of our cost savings actions when we provide 2024 guidance next quarter. Turning to our outlook. As Bob noted earlier, we now expect core EPS for the full year to decline by mid-30%. Our expectations for double-digit revenue and SOP growth in our GWS segment are more than offset by capital markets-driven SOP declines in advisory and REI segments. Looking to next year, while the recovery of transaction activity, particularly in capital markets, will take longer than initially anticipated, we expect double-digit growth of our resilient and secularly favored lines of business, which combined have exceeded $1.5 billion of SOP on a trailing 12-month basis. In addition, we will continue to benefit from strategic deployment of capital and our cost reduction initiatives. Taking into account all of these circumstances, we believe this year will be the trough for our earnings and anticipate meaningful growth next year. However, our return to record earnings will likely be delayed a year relative to our earlier expectations. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. I think Tony, you're talking about maybe prior remarks that we made. We're looking broad-based across the company at M&A, and we've been focused on the areas of our business that are resilient and cyclery favored. Those are the types of larger deals we've done in the past, and those are the types of deals that we're looking at now. One of the things that's happening right now is we are looking at a number of deals, and we've talked about deals on the larger end of the range that we've typically looked at in the past or we've typically executed in the past. But pricing has become more of a challenge than it was a year ago or even 6 months ago, similar to what's happening in the real estate market with the gap between buyer and seller valuation remaining higher even increasing as interest rates are increasing. A similar impact is happening to M&A. So for us, our cost of capital is increasing slightly. Our risk appetite is reducing slightly. And so we need seller prices to come down for us to be able to execute some of these deals \u2013 many of these deals. We expect our resilient lines of business in aggregate, which for the year to generate $1.6 billion of SOP to grow in the low double-digit range going forward into the future. And GWS specifically, that SOP for this year is going to grow in the mid-double-digit range, so low teens range and should continue going forward. Yes, absolutely. Steve, that's the right way to think about it. We were going into the latter half of the year, our expectation was for $600 million. As you said, we did $500 million in this quarter. So we are on track to deliver the same amount we were thinking last quarter. That is a one-time tax planning benefit that we had this quarter. For the full year, we're expecting our tax rate to come in at about 21%. And excluding that benefit this quarter, our tax rate is about 20% in Q3. So office leasing this year has been performing in-line with our expectations. There has been some we noted some drop-off in the larger office deals, but we were anticipating decline a mid-15% decline across office leasing. On the industrial side, that is \u2013 industrial leasing is performing slightly below expectations. But as Bob alluded to, that is primarily driven by the largest industrial transactions and the largest occupiers of industrial space who took on a lot of space over the past couple of years and are resetting. We don't expect that to be a continued trend going into next year. And in terms of mix, I think our leasing has grown. Industrial has grown as a percentage of our overall leasing and offices declined, but that isn't out of what we were expecting going into the year and into the quarter. There is potentially some, but we are not expecting the decline next year to be greater than what we saw this year. And I think what's important to note, we provided some high-level remarks around what we are expecting over the next couple of years. And that's not to provide any sort of guidance around what we will expect because we all know that it's very difficult to anticipate how the broader external factors will impact the company. But to put context around it, we are very confident that our GWS business will continue to deliver double-digit growth. And if it delivers double-digit SOP growth over the next couple of years, and the remainder of our segments remained flat in 2024 and get back to \u2013 don't even need to get back to 2019 levels of earnings, we will get back to our record levels of EPS. So, in terms of leasing, I just want to emphasize that even if there is a slight decline next year, we still have a path to growth over the next 2 years. Okay. So, for the full year, we are expecting within GWS that our SOP growth will be in line with that low-double digit that we have been talking about throughout the year. Advisory overall will be down about in the 30% range. And then REI, as you know is down a little over 50% for the full year. In terms of what's guided our reduced outlook from what we said in Q2 to what we are seeing now from that 20% to 25% EPS decline down to a mid-30s decline. About a third of that is related to capital markets and about a third is related to development and the remainder is men across the rest of the business. Absolutely. That \u2013 and that is the point that we are trying to get across is that there is a reasonable path to getting back to record, and we are not anticipating a sharp recovery, especially not next year, and we don't require a sharp recovery in 2025 to get to that record level. Again, our resilient and cycle favorite lines of business, which include GWS but also includes property management, the recurring elements of our investment management fees, valuations in loan servicing, not in aggregate is $1.6 billion of SOP. So, that growing at low-double digits over the next 2 years will create meaningful value. And then, again, our transactional lines of business, so development, the portion of investment management that is more transactional loan service \u2013 loan origination and sales origination. Those elements only need to get back to just shy of 2019 levels for us to get to record earnings. Yes. So, in your first question, our pipeline across GWS and that includes both facilities management and project management is it continues to be at record levels. We have a large and growing pipeline. It's split between about 50% new clients and 50% existing clients. And of those new clients, about half of those are first-generation clients. So, about a third of our overall pipeline is first-generation outsourcers. But the important part is that our overall pipeline is building. And yes, those first-generation outsourcers take longer, the sales cycle is longer to convert them over to outsourcing, but it's a huge opportunity and it's a growing opportunity and it is building our pipeline. To your second question around what the opportunity is, it's hard to accurately estimate it, but we believe that only 30% of the overall market is outsourced today. So, there is 70% of white space."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad and good morning everyone. Commercial real estate capital markets remained under significant pressure in the third quarter. As a result, we experienced a sustained slowdown in property sales and debt financing activity, which drove the decline in core EPS. This decline was exacerbated by delays in harvesting development assets, which we will sell when market conditions improve. Over the last several quarters, we have detailed the increased importance of our resilient and secularly favored businesses. These businesses saw continued solid growth in the third quarter, led by Global Workplace Solutions. Interest rates have increased more than 100 basis points since we reported second quarter results 90 days ago, continuing the sharpest rise in rates in nearly 40 years. The unexpected jump in rates has pushed back the capital markets recovery. Property prices are gradually declining and we believe this process won't complete and transaction activity won't rebound materially until investors are confident that interest rates have peaked and credit becomes readily available. We now believe this rebound is unlikely to occur until the second half of next year at the earliest. In the meantime, as we discussed last quarter, pockets of opportunity exists and the breadth and depth of our market presence gives us visibility into where we want to be positioned for the long-term. For example, year-to-date, we have committed more than $350 million in co-investments to value-add opportunistic and development strategies and believe these investments are positioned to deliver quite attractive returns as market conditions improve. This is the time in the market cycle when well-positioned investors can secure opportunities that deliver outsized returns. We expect to identify and act on more opportunities to deploy capital, especially in co-investments in M&A while the market is depressed. In light of continuing challenges, in the real estate capital markets, we have lowered our expectations for 2023 core EPS to a mid-30% decrease from the 20% to 25% decline we anticipated 90 days ago. The reduced outlook is almost entirely attributable to our interest rate sensitive businesses. While it's difficult to forecast the timing of the capital markets recovery, the resilient and secularly favored businesses we mentioned earlier have generated over $1.5 billion of SOP over the last 12 months and we expect them to represent over 60% of CBRE's SOP for full year 2023. We further expect SOP from these businesses to increase by double digits next year. Emma will walk you through our outlook after she reviews the quarter. Emma? Tony, it's been happening for a while. It's become a little more pronounced, and we think it's going to go into next year. What's causing it is we don't have a recession. Everybody knows that we don't have the kind of financial problems we've had in prior cycles. But we have a lot of uncertainty, and we have uncertainty around the cost of capital, which causes companies of all types to be careful about their expenditures that would run through their income statement. Of course, the minute that happens, they are cautious about leasing. We don't think it's going to become materially more pronounced than it is now. And as we've said, we think now when we get to the back half of next year, things will recover. That's where we are. I think what's notable is to slow down on behalf of big absorbers of industrial space. We went through an extended period where not only were they taking space to support their growth, some of them were taking space to hedge against future growth. They are now burning through that space. And when that's done, we will start to see leasing come back by those big industrial users. It is notable that we still only have 4% vacancy in industrial space. So they'll get back to being careful to make sure they have adequate inventory. Uncertainty around interest rates is one really prominent fact and the expectation that they are now going to come down later than we previously thought. Number two, there is still a view that values are going to come down some that private privately held assets haven't come into line yet and maybe another 5% to 10% decline in asset values. But Steve, I really think it's important to remember this about our business. Those assets are real, and they are held by investors, and there is buyers with massive amounts of capital. Waiting to make trades when those two things sort out, we will get back to an active trading environment. It's not like some things that go away and never come back, right? The assets are there. The base of assets is actually growing and the people that hold the assets, there is a significant number of them and a significant volume of them that want to trade those assets with buyers ready to go. And buyers are watching closely the interest rates and watching closely the valuations and things are starting to come in-line to the point where we think there will be trading again in the second half of next year. It's \u2013 it could be in some areas, Jade, but we think that what's going on with office space has kind of settled out, right? Rates have come way down, users of office space have backed off, people that want premium office space for the experience side of things for their employees are going after it and we think they'll continue to go after it into next year. We think industrial has slowed down for a time being. It will come back to the back half of next year, and I think you commented already, retail's mixed. But there is a lot of retail activity in the economy now, and there is reason to believe that, that will kind of sustain the way it is now. Well, when the economy slows down, the company's focus intensely on cost. And when they focus on cost, they think about having somebody like us, us more than anybody else handle their real estate facilities for them because we save them money. That is an absolute front and center dimension of that business. Where you see things slow down is capital expenditures, which can hit project management, but there is so much momentum around various parts of our project management business related to enhancing the experience for clients in the office space that companies have, which is a big deal for them now, and we think that's going to continue to be a big deal. We think that will offset the focus on reducing capital expenditures. Also, that project management business, as you know, does a lot of stuff in the infrastructure, green energy, etcetera, areas. And so we think that there is offsetting factors there that will allow that business to continue to grow to double-digit rates. So the bottom line is, I don't think what we're seeing in the economy and the uncertainty in the economy would push that down below being a double-digit grower next year. Yes. Our underwriting that we do across our REI business for the acquisition of existing assets and for the investment in the co-investment and development deals is all driven by interest rates that we think will be available to us when we capitalize those projects. It's \u2013 there is great attention paid to that and a lot of study around that by our research people and Chief Economist office, etcetera. So what's in those underwritings is reflective of that view. What's going to \u2013 we commented a little earlier, what's going to drive the sale of assets is the stabilization or decline in interest rates and the general view that values have bottomed out. And again, we now think that timing is second half of next year. And we do think prices are going to come down a bit more, maybe as much as 10%. Thank you. Well, this \u2013 what typically happens in an environment like this and what is definitively happening now on the development side, where the investments we make are largely acquiring land for future development. Landholders often landholders that bought that land to develop it, you can't develop it because they can't get the capital to develop it or they don't have the capital themselves to make the co-investment needed to develop it. And so good land sites that otherwise wouldn't have been available become available. And because of our position in two ways, our balance sheet, plus the stable of really strong developers we have in local markets. We identify opportunities of this nature. We're in the market all the time, up and down cycles. We know the land sites that are good. We know the land sites that we would have liked to have gotten that we didn't get. And what we do is we go back because we now have the capital to take those land sites down, we go back and try to secure some of those sites. And cycle after cycle, what you see is that it's the acquisition of those land sites and the development deals that result from those land sites that become your best profit deals. And as Emma said earlier, we're focused on multifamily and industrial there. On the investment management side, we think this is a good point in the cycle to look at value add and opportunistic. So, we have an opportunistic fund run out of the UK that's got a very, very strong track record that we have made a significant commitment to with our own balance sheet to raise the next fund to do investments in real estate secondaries and we are very excited about that opportunity. And then we have three value-add businesses, one in each region of the world U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific, all of which were providing co-investment to do our next fund in, all of which we see lots of opportunity in. So, that's our co-investment strategy. That's what \u2013 when we talk about $370 million year-to-date, that's where we have invested. And we are well positioned to continue to invest. Well, there is \u2013 clearly, there is movement into cash and cash return \u2013 you can get returns on that, that you couldn't get previously, so secured debt, etcetera. There is no doubt that, that dynamic is at play in what's going on with the non-traded REITs, etcetera and core assets. But people are ready to get back into real estate when things sort out. There is just no doubt about it. The amount of capital that's on the sidelines that wants to get into commercial real estate is enormous. And what's going to have to happen as we said, is interest rates are going to have to stabilize and the belief that valuations have come down is going to have to be there. There is an increasing interest, and I just walked through what we are doing on the development side and opportunistic investment side. There is an increased interest in people getting into those areas that have a longer horizon for returns on their capital and have a higher risk appetite. And there is always, of course a big chunk of capital with that orientation. So, that's what's going on. Well, we \u2013 the biggest thing, Michael, that's shifted in our view is that it's going to take longer for interest rates to come down. It's going to take longer for debt, in particular, to become available for real estate \u2013 commercial real estate transactions. And as a result, transactions are not going to return until the back half of next year, where we thought they were going to return late this year, early next year. Secondly, we have introduced this notion that we are seeing, particularly with industrial tenants that the uncertainty is just causing them to pause, and we think that's going to go through the first half of next year. But we really don't think that's going to be a big deal because they are burning through inventories of space that they took down for defensive purposes, I guess for lack of a better term. And so that's what we see where if you were to sum it all up, the recovery that we thought would start towards the end of this year, we now think is going to start six or so months later, maybe a little longer. And for us, that pushes back our assumptions about the return to peak earnings a year or so into the following year. For us specifically, we just have a very good business in Japan. And it's \u2013 obviously, that's a huge economy and Tokyo is a huge real estate market. And over the years, we \u2013 there has been a struggle around the notion of intermediation there. There was a lot of business done directly by buyer and seller, tenant, landlord, etcetera. That intermediation has become more accepted. There has also been a struggle to have non-Japanese domestic companies in the mix, so to speak. And that is \u2013 as it relates to being the designated intermediate \u2013 when intermediation happens and also being a home for talent. We have really changed our profile as a recruiter there over the last few years. And we have really changed our profile over there the last few years as somebody that's a recognized intermediary. As a result, we used to talk about, well, we have got good growth in Asia, but good growth on bases of business that weren't that needle moving to our overall results. Japan is now our second most profitable market in the world behind the United States for advisory business. So, when Japan does relatively well as it's doing now, you get the results we are getting. It's big enough to be needle moving for us. And then in general, as you know, the return to the office across Asia and Pacific is ahead of where it is in either the United States or EMEA. Jade, in terms of M&A, we \u2013 Emma made this comment. We look across our whole business. We have a very capable corporate development team that partners up with a group of geographic and business line leaders across the whole business around the world and across our lines of business to seek out M&A opportunities where we think we can enhance our offering to our clients. We just \u2013 you just saw today, we announced something in the \u2013 for our capital markets business in the investment banking capital advisors area. That was an area where we thought we had a bit of a hole. We went out and brought on a business that was very substantial global and additive. Lots of areas of interest, investment management has been an area of interest for us, but sole of others. We have several areas of interest in our GWS business. We have select areas of interest in our advisory business. We even have some areas we are looking at in the development business. But one of the things that's going on right now, and Emma mentioned this, is that pricing for M&A has not moved quite as quickly as we hoped or thought it would. And we are just showing a lot of \u2013 excuse me, a lot of discipline around what we are going to do in terms of acquiring other companies. We are just simply not going to pay prices that we think are unreasonable just to get businesses that we like. We think pricing is going to come into line. We see some signs of that. We have got a pipeline across those businesses and geographies that we like, but we are being disciplined. As it relates to infrastructure, there is two areas of our business where we are active with infrastructure. We have a nice size infrastructure investment management business. It's small relative to our overall investment management business, but it's in the upper-single digits in terms of billions of dollars of AUM, and we are looking for opportunities to grow that because we think it's got great long-term secular profile. The other place where we have a very significant infrastructure business is with the Turner & Townsend acquisition. They do a lot of infrastructure, program management, cost consultancy and project management. And they are well positioned \u2013 they are very well positioned in geographies around the world where that work is going on. They do a decent amount of work and a significantly growing amount of work as it relates to sustainability. So, we have a pretty strong infrastructure profile with them. Thanks everyone and we look forward to getting back together with you when we announce our year-end earnings."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brad Burke. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrad Burke: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Earlier today, we posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks and an excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Before we kick off today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll remind you that today\u2019s presentation contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements concerning our economic outlook, our business plans and our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning\u2019s earnings release and our SEC filings. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. I am joined on today\u2019s call by Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Like last quarter, CBRE\u2019s results slightly exceeded our expectations, driven largely by better-than-expected growth in Global Workplace Solutions and aggregate growth in our resilient lines of business, which Emma will describe in detail, offset by weaker-than-expected property sales and advisory services. It is notable when considering our performance that the prior year comparison was especially difficult. We had our best quarter ever for core earnings per share in last year\u2019s second quarter driven by exceptionally robust development earnings. To put this in perspective, our development earnings in last year\u2019s second quarter exceeded the level of development operating profit in any prior full year except 2021. With this in mind, my remarks this morning will largely focus on how both CBRE and the macro environment performed relative to our expectations coming into the quarter, followed by some high-level comments on our outlook. The economy performed better than we had anticipated going into the quarter in terms of both GDP and employment growth. However, the opposite was true with respect to interest rates, were increases in the last 90 days, coupled with expectations that rates will end the year higher than anticipated last quarter pressured the elements of our business that are sensitive to commercial real estate capital flows, particularly our sales and financing businesses, we expect this pressure to continue for the remainder of the year. At the same time, we are beginning to see signs in our own business that will eventually lead to improved performance likely starting next year. For example, we capitalized 10 new development projects during the second quarter versus only five projects in the prior two quarters combined. Our investment management team responsible for capital raising has noted a definitive change in investor sentiment in the last 90 days. Many of these investors remain cautious but are now exploring how they can take advantage of the reset in pricing as they develop their 2024 commitment plans. Looking ahead, we still anticipate a mild recession. However, we now expect the recession to occur at least one quarter later than we had previously thought, followed by a recovery beginning next year. We realize that our investors are closely watching the U.S. office market and bank exposure to commercial real estate loans. Our views regarding both are consistent with those we expressed at the end of the first quarter. We now expect full year 2023 core EPS to decline by 20% to 25% against last year\u2019s record level, with the majority of the decrease due to the delayed capital markets recovery. We continue to expect our resilient lines of business in aggregate to grow for the full year at a rate that is consistent with our expectations three months ago. Further, we believe there is a reasonable path to achieving a record level of core EPS in 2024. Although reaching that goal now has become more difficult with expected delay and the return of capital markets activity. Emma will now take you through a more detailed look at our performance for the quarter and provide additional insights on our outlook. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob. On a consolidated basis, growth of our resilient lines of business continued during the quarter. Together, these businesses, which consist of our entire Global Workplace Solutions business, loan servicing, property management, valuation and the asset management component of investment management saw net revenue rise 10% in constant currency. Please turn to Slide 6 as I discuss our Advisory Services results. Weakness in capital markets had a pronounced effect on the advisory business. Advisory net revenue fell 21% against a challenging prior year comparison when net revenue grew by more than 20% versus Q2 2021. Our capital markets businesses, property sales and loan origination together saw revenue fell 44% versus a 13% increase in the prior year second quarter. In the Americas, property sales revenue fell 49% more than expected, reflecting limited credit availability and the gap between buyer and seller expectations. We are beginning to see an uptick in investor appetite for industrial assets where buyers will accept modest negative leverage due to the significant embedded rent gains over the past several years. In U.S. multifamily CBRE currently has $18 billion of deals in the market, more than double our volumes sold in the first half of the year. Sales revenue fell 43% in EMEA and 11% in APAC, both in local currency. We are increasingly well positioned in APAC. Notably, revenue in Japan has increased by 16% in local currency year-to-date, and this has become our most profitable advisory market outside the U.S. In contrast with Capital Markets, leasing performed in line with our expectations with revenue down 16% versus 40% growth in the prior year second quarter. The leasing decline was driven by the Americas. Leasing revenue grew in overseas markets as combined APAC and EMEA increased 6% in local currency. Among property types in the U.S., office was weakest with revenue down 30%, while Industrial was down only 10% against the challenging prior year comparison. Loan servicing revenues declined 6% and due to significant prepayment fees in the prior year. Excluding prepayments, loan servicing revenue increased by 6%. Prepayment fees fell significantly beginning in the third quarter of last year, so the prepayment headwind should diminish going forward. Valuation revenue declined 6% in the quarter in local currency, largely driven by our U.S. business. In the U.S., we perform a significant volume of work for financial institutions. This business has slowed down this year as investors pulled back from investment into commercial real estate. Property management net revenue rose 5% in local currency, increasing across most geographies with notable strength in Continental Europe and Southeast Asia. Turning to our GWS business on Slide 7. Net revenue increased 13% and SOP grew by 7% in the quarter, slightly exceeding our expectations. Growth was driven by the continued strength of our local business in the UK and expansion into the U.S. and an enterprise FM clients where we increased both the scope and geographic reach of our services. Demand for project management services also remained strong, led by our Turner & Townsend business. SOP margins declined from the prior year second quarter due to higher OpEx investments to support our local businesses, continued geographic expansion as well as costs associated with integrating recent acquisitions. Even though we expect these investments to continue through the balance of the year, full year SOP should be slightly better than we expected with the margin in line with last year\u2019s level. Our local business represents a tremendous growth opportunity, particularly in the U.S., which is expected to account for just 15% of this business lines net revenue this year. This business began with the Norland acquisition in late 2013. It has grown significantly from its original UK focus and net revenue is expected to grow by over 20% this year. Our pipeline remained elevated, more than 20% above the Q2 2022 level. The pipeline growth is driven by large first-generation outsourcers that are focused on lowering the real estate costs. Turning to our REI segment on Slide 8. As expected, SOP was down significantly versus the prior year when we generated a record SOP from this segment. Looking at the Investment Management business, nearly all of the operating profit decline was driven by lower incentive fees and modest co-investment losses versus co-investment gains in last year\u2019s second quarter. Assets under management fell by 1% driven by lower market valuations. The foundation of our IM business, which earns base fees on core and core plus assets remains healthy, and we expect co-investment gains and incentive fees to return when broader commercial real estate market conditions improve. Turning to development. We realized a modest operating loss. As we have discussed before, it is important to look at this business over the long term versus any particular quarter. Our highly flexible financing structure allows us to hold on to completed assets if we believe they can yield better returns in the future. And we continually evaluate our portfolio with that in mind. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $92 million in development and operating profit compared to $544 million in the prior 12 months, a period of record performance. Due to anticipated asset monetizations in Q4 of this year, we expect higher operating profits for the full year than we realized over the trailing 12-month period. As Bob mentioned, investors have begun to selectively deploy capital into development, favoring well-located industrial and residential projects. Our pipeline increased slightly during the quarter, positioning us well for a market recovery. Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of capital management and our balance sheet. During the quarter, we raised $1 billion of capital through a senior unsecured bond offering and shortly after quarter end, we raised an additional $350 million from refinancing and upsizing our euro term loan. We now have even more capacity to invest while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. We have a robust M&A pipeline and are evaluating multiple opportunities in the range of $1 billion. We expect these investments, if completed, will drive meaningful shareholder value. We did not repurchase any shares in Q2, but have repurchased $100 million of shares month-to-date. Looking at free cash flow, we had originally expected to generate just over $1 billion in 2023. We now expect this figure to be closer to $600 million to $800 million for two main reasons. First, as noted, our expectation for earnings has declined, which has a direct impact to cash flow. Second, the cost of Trammell Crow Company developments that are consolidated on our balance sheet as well as broker recruitment costs run free cash flow. We are seeing attractive opportunities to make targeted investments in both land acquisitions for future development and broker recruiting, and we now anticipate investing more in these two areas versus our expectation last quarter. I\u2019ll end with our updated outlook for 2023 on Slide 10. As Bob noted, we now expect core EPS to decline 20% to 25% from last year\u2019s record level, greater than the low to mid-double-digit decline we previously discussed. Our original outlook anticipated a low teens decline in advisory SOP, a low double-digit increase in GWS SOP and a nearly 30% decline in REI SOP coming off a year when our development business produced $330 million of operating profit. The incremental decline in our revised outlook is primarily driven by our view that the capital markets will not recover until next year. As a result, we expect lower investment sales and loan origination revenue than we anticipated 90 days ago and an extended time line to realize gains both in development and investment management. Looking at each segment, we now expect advisory SOP to decline by approximately 20% for the full year, a greater decline than we had been anticipating. In GWS, we now expect SOP to reach over $1 billion for the year or low-to-mid double-digit growth, slightly better than we previously expected, with the margin on net revenue in line with 2022 level. In REI, we now expect full year SOP in the low $300 million range, reflecting a 35% to 40% decline slightly worse than we previously expected. The primary driver is lower than anticipated co-investment gains and incentive fees in investment management as well as fewer development gains. We expect core EPS in the second half to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Beyond normal seasonality, we anticipate most development sales will take place in Q4, and the investments we\u2019re making in the growth of the GWS business will have an increasing benefit through the second half of the year. As such, we expect the fourth quarter to represent nearly three quarters of second half core EPS. With that, operator, we\u2019ll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thanks very much. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks, good morning. Bob or Emma, I was just hoping you could spend a little time on the capital allocation. I guess no share buybacks was a bit surprising. I know you talked last quarter about looking at a number of M&A opportunities and maybe that was just the focus. But just any more color you could share on kind of why no buybacks despite, I guess, modest investment in the quarter. And it sounds like you have stepped that up already per the slide deck in Q3, but just some more color would be great.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, Steve. So our focus for M&A and capital allocation over the next 12 months to 18 months is consistent with what we talked about last quarter. We continue to have a very strong pipeline across our M&A portfolio engagement has steadily increased across a number of deals as the year has progressed. And as we said before, we\u2019re looking across our portfolio of businesses, we\u2019re looking for opportunities to enhance our core offerings going forward. But the reality is that deals take time, and we\u2019re working on a number of them, and it takes even more time to do a very well-executed deal where we can underwrite to the level that we think are required to deliver a really strong return. So we\u2019re encouraged around where we are, and we continue to balance that with buybacks, and you can see us doing that through the rest of the year.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just turning to the sales environment. It actually came in a little bit better than, I guess, what we had sort of feared or worried about. But I guess, Bob, I\u2019m trying to figure out from your perspective, is it the actual level of rates that matters? Or is it just the fact that CMBS isn\u2019t really open and functioning in a smooth way and the banks aren\u2019t lending, I guess what do you ultimately need to see to really get the wheels grease to get the capital market business back? Is it the absolute level of rates? Or is it just people lending even at higher rates, but that there\u2019s capital availability.\nBob Sulentic: It\u2019s three things, Steve. It\u2019s both of those things. It\u2019s the level of rates. It\u2019s the availability of debt, but it\u2019s also the mindset of buyers and sellers as to whether things have settled out and there is clarity about where cost \u2013 values of assets are going, cost of financing is going. So I think we had all three of those things burdening the market in the last 90 days. You said you thought it was a little better than you expected. In our view, it was a little worse than we expected. But we also think things are starting to clarify a bit. We are seeing things signs as we said in our prepared remarks that people are getting ready to act, which is good news. And we think things will sort out more with the banks now, and there\u2019ll be debt available from them, et cetera. So we\u2019re feeling better about where things are going to be, but we\u2019re probably going to see that happen next year.\nSteve Sakwa: And just one last follow-up. Just if you had to think about 2024, I guess, you would assume that it\u2019s probably more back half weighted in terms of just the volume and kind of the business activity. So sort of think about more second half 2024 than first half 2024.\nBob Sulentic: For sure. One thing that has become clear to us in the past quarter is that the \u2013 if we\u2019re going to have a recession, it\u2019s been delayed. Of course, the recovery related to that would then be delayed. And also, it\u2019s just crystal clear that the settling out of interest rates and the availability of debt has been delayed, which, again, is clearly reflected in what happened in our quarter and clearly reflected in what we\u2019ve said about the rest of the year.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks, good morning. First one, following up on Steve\u2019s discussion on capital allocation. It seemed like last quarter, you were pointing to a pretty sizable M&A deal that you had circled. Did that fall out of bed? Or is it still a potential transaction? Just wondering if you can give us some color there?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Tony, the \u2013 I think the thing that is really important to note, and Emma already alluded to it is \u2013 we are talking about big M&A deals now. We\u2019re $1 billion deals, and we\u2019re working on a number of them. We\u2019ve had a steady stream of smaller infill deals. Big deals kind of take on a life of their own. You have to get through agreeing with the other party on a deal, working through an integration plan, working through an agreement that then becomes a definitive agreement and those things ebb and flow. And the notion that they would \u2013 you would talk about in one quarter and then with high confidence they would land in the next quarter. That\u2019s just not how bigger deals play out. I will tell you 90 days after we last talked about it, are view of our M&A opportunity is as strong as it was then. We\u2019ve got several things we\u2019re working on. They\u2019re not going to all make we\u2019re confident though that some things will make and that it will be a very productive use of capital for us over the next few quarters and it will be a very good strategic use of capital for us, which aren\u2019t exactly the same thing. We think we\u2019re going to be able to move our business forward strategically very nicely with some of the things we\u2019re working on.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Did that temper though, just the amount of buyback to kind of keep capacity for some of these larger deals? Because I think if you look back over the last year or so, you\u2019ve had some pretty strong buyback quarters. And so just trying to understand what to expect on that side?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, Tony. So we\u2019re constantly balancing our capital allocation between buybacks and M&A and looking at our pipeline and the time \u2013 weighting the timing of when we think something may get executed. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. Through the remainder of this year, we expect to complete about $600 million of buybacks in the second half. We\u2019ve done $100 million in July. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there is we put a 10b5-1 in place, and that\u2019s really related to where our price goes. So as our price goes higher, we\u2019re buying back fewer shares as you\u2019d naturally expect.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thanks. And then Emma, separately, you had mentioned some drags in GWS just the investments you\u2019re making there and that those would persist for the rest of the year. Can you maybe give us some ideas to the order of magnitude and whether or not those are lifted then in 2024, where we see like a pickup?\nEmma Giamartino: So those are primarily in my remarks, I commented on. They\u2019re primarily related to our local business. We did a couple of acquisitions, smaller acquisitions, where we don\u2019t normalize integration costs. And you\u2019re seeing those integration costs in the quarter. You\u2019re also seeing investments in our local business as we expand that business outside of their current geographies. So there are some upfront costs required to build out those platforms. You\u2019re seeing that in this quarter, we expect that to steadily alleviate through the rest of the year and to end the year overall with the GWS margin in line with last year. And it\u2019s too early to comment on 2024, but I would expect those absent incremental investment, which we\u2019re always doing, our margins will improve going into 2024. I do want to comment a little bit on the local business because that is something that we haven\u2019t talked about extensively and is a really strong contributor to our growth, especially GWS\u2019s growth over time. That came out of the acquisition of Norland at the end of 2013, and it was primarily a UK-based company, and that\u2019s really how we entered the local or regional facilities management market. And when we acquired them, they had about $40 million of EBITDA. And today, they have about \u2013 we expect for the year, $230 million of EBITDA. So that\u2019s an exceptional growth story for us. And this year, we\u2019re expecting it to grow another 20%. But as I said, it requires investments over time to launch into new territories, but that will \u2013 we\u2019ll see operating leverage as those businesses grow.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And if I could just ask one more. You talked about some of the investments that affect free cash flow with people and recruiting and so forth. I guess just casually observing it does seem like there\u2019s been a pickup of articles of people moving around. Can you just comment just generally on the landscape and kind of where the efforts may lie in terms of trying to recruit and retain folks right now?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Tony, when we talk about recruiting and retention, it\u2019s heavily skewed toward our brokerage business. And our brokerage business is experiencing a good year and an active year of recruiting. And we think it\u2019s going to measure up with some of the best years we\u2019ve ever had. Recruiting \u2013 even in a tough market, recruiting is expensive because what you\u2019re typically doing is recruiting the best brokers in the marketplace, and it\u2019s like buying great companies. They never come cheap. But we\u2019re at a time now where people are finding their platforms and the circumstances in the companies they\u2019re in today being less supportive of what they want to do with their careers less supportive of how they want to support their clients than they think CBRE can be. So we\u2019re finding good hunting out there in a lot of places in bringing on people and as a result, spending more money. It\u2019s a little bit like Emma said about the land situation with Trammell Crow Company. There\u2019s a lot of people out there that previously, we\u2019re able to buy land, industrial land or multifamily land that aren\u2019t in a great position to buy it now. It\u2019s not cheap. You still have to pay up to get good land. But you can get some land sites that you couldn\u2019t get previously. You can get some brokers you couldn\u2019t get previously. And that\u2019s what Emma\u2019s comments were centered on about the incremental use of cash for those two types of investments into the future.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question we have comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead. \nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. The debt issuance overall that you mentioned the term loan upsizing and also the senior notes. Was that to be incremental or a refinancing of debt? Is it to add that capacity to the company overall?\nEmma Giamartino: It\u2019s a combination of both. We\u2019re always looking for \u2013 we prefer a long-term capital source. So we\u2019ve been looking for opportunities to raise that long-term capital. And what we did in the near term as we used those proceeds to pay down our revolver. We like having that flexibility and capacity on our revolver. The other positive from it is that our net interest rate once \u2013 after we raised the bond and expanded the term loan is actually lower than it was drawn on our revolver. So that\u2019s a positive impact, which should endure for the next couple of years.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. On the cash flow performance side, cash flow was negative in the quarter. Just looking at the cash flow statement in the supplemental, one of the items was timing related due to the GSE multifamily business. I think proceeds from sale of mortgages were below the originations. The other big item looks to be in working capital on the payable side and also in receivables. Is that timing related? Was there anything outsized in the second quarter you wanted to call out?\nEmma Giamartino: So specifically \u2013 first of all, I think it\u2019s important to look at our free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, and that\u2019s what I spoke to in my prepared remarks. And we\u2019re really focused on what we expect for the year, which is in that $600 million to $800 million range. In the quarter, specifically, what\u2019s been if you \u2013 what\u2019s been impacting the decline is primarily the decline in core net income. All of the adjustments, the cash adjustments that get you to free cash flow are pretty much in line with what you saw last year for the second quarter.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. So nothing unusual in working capital?\nEmma Giamartino: No.\nJade Rahmani: Okay. Post second quarter leasing, I recently heard that in New York City, in particular, there\u2019s been a big uptick in office leasing, at least interest in certain buildings. Do you have any views on that?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Jade, that\u2019s an interesting story. And by the way, it\u2019s a story that\u2019s being pulled increasingly, and it\u2019s this bifurcation between really good buildings and other buildings that are less attractive from an experience point of view for tenants. And what we\u2019ve seen in New York, in particular, is that companies that want to get their people back into the office and believe it\u2019s important, are very, very interested in getting the best possible space to create the best environment for those tenants to get them in. So there\u2019s actually a little bit of a feeding frenzy for the best space in a place like Midtown Manhattan. In fact, I had a conversation with our senior most brokers, and we have 125 or so of them that qualify for this, we call Vice Chairman. And we have a Vice Chairman in New York, that focuses mainly on hedge funds, investment companies, et cetera, in Midtown Manhattan. He told me a couple of weeks ago that this is going to be his best year ever in leasing, which is kind of at odds with everything you\u2019re hearing about return to the office, the attractiveness of office space. But what it is, it\u2019s those clients wanting to gobble up the best space, and by the way, at record rental rates so they can create this environment for their people. So we are going to see this circumstance continue to play out where the best buildings do quite well. And the buildings at the bottom really, really struggled in between, you\u2019re going to see buildings repurpose because that \u2013 in the absence of those buildings in the middle being repurposed and moved up the spectrum in terms of their quality, there aren\u2019t going to be places for these companies to go when they do want to create this environment for their people. By the way, it\u2019s one of the things that is a bit of an encouraging sign for companies like us who provide a lot of services to office buildings over the longer run.\nJade Rahmani: Thanks. I\u2019m going to get back in the queue. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Stephen Sheldon from William Blair. Please go ahead. \nStephen Sheldon: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one here, just any general updates on how you\u2019re thinking about the cost structure. It sounds like you\u2019re actually investing behind broker capacity maybe to be better positioned for recovery. Is that kind of a fair read through? And have you taken any notable incremental cost actions elsewhere relative to what you would have thought three months ago?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. So cost is something that we\u2019re consistently focused on. Our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, is consistently thinking about ways to drive cost management through our company. And we\u2019re moving from \u2013 this isn\u2019t an episodic event where we cut out a bunch of cross and then we move on. It\u2019s something that our leaders are constantly thinking about going forward. And what you\u2019re seeing right now is there is a balance of managing the business and the fixed cost for what\u2019s required just for our base foundation and our base platform and then investments that should drive future growth. So you mentioned broker recruiting. Those are investments that will drive future growth. The integration costs that I talked about within local are expanding into new territories. Those are investments that will drive future growth. So it\u2019s a constant balance. And we are through the second half of the year. Very focused on ensuring that, we are managing our cost base to an appropriate level for the growth that we\u2019re expecting going forward.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up in development, I guess, there\u2019s usually not a ton of visibility. But just how are you thinking about the potential monetization there heading into next year? Would you expect actual harvesting activity to maybe pick up later 2024, maybe 2025 once cap rates, et cetera, have hopefully become a little bit more favorable. Just curious what visibility you have there on the outlook and development.\nBob Sulentic: We definitely expect monetization of our Trammell Crow assets to pick up if, in fact, cap rates perform well. And if, in fact, there\u2019s capital availability for buyers, one of the really great things about that business \u2013 and just to remind everybody, we have $17 billion of product in development now, and we have another $13 billion behind that in the pipeline. Those are projects that we have control over, but we haven\u2019t started to develop yet. We have those projects capitalized in a way that we have flexibility over when we harvest them. So if you look at a quarter like this, I think Emma, we sold one building in Q3 \u2013 excuse me, Q2, we just decided this is not a good time to be selling our assets. And that positions us well for profitability in the future when the time comes to sell those assets. We\u2019ve got really strong equity partners. We\u2019ve got a little of our own equity in them. We\u2019ve got flexible debt financing. So I think that business is positioned to do very good things for us later next year and beyond when the capital markets come back around.\nStephen Sheldon: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Michael Griffin from Citi. Please go ahead. \nMichael Griffin: Great, thanks. Maybe just going back to the M&A pipeline and potential opportunities there. Just given your expected slowdown in the capital markets environment, do you expect more of these opportunities for M&A to be in the GWS segment or advisory or kind of any color on where you\u2019re seeing acquisition opportunities?\nBob Sulentic: Well, Michael, we don\u2019t want to be too specific about where we see them. I will tell you, we are pursuing M&A opportunities that we think do a couple of things. Number one, they advance our ability to serve our clients in areas where we think we\u2019re not as strong as we\u2019d like to be. Number two; they are really well-run companies that we, in some cases, will bring leaders in to run parts of our business with those acquisitions. And they \u2013 when we announced some of these things, they\u2019ll sound kind of consistent with what people might have expected.  And some of what we\u2019re doing will sound different than what people might have expected. When we \u2013 Emma talked about the Norland acquisition, which has been one of the great ones we made. I don\u2019t think anybody would have expected that acquisition a few years ago. We had grown to the point where it made sense to buy that company. We\u2019ve had others like that. And I think you should expect to see M&A from us that will expand our capability to serve our company with really well-run companies with really good brands. And if we can\u2019t get those kind of deals done, we\u2019re not going to do M&A. We\u2019re not going to force it just to build scale. We can build scale through organic growth.\nMichael Griffin: Great. And then just on the capital markets outlook. Has anything changed across the different regions? Maybe are you expecting a greater pickup in APAC relative to the Americas or \u2013 any kind of color you could give on the state of performance of the different regions would be helpful.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. On the sales front, it hasn\u2019t \u2013 I think overall, our expectations, as we said, have declined. A couple of things to note about the second half of the year. Overall, it we\u2019re looking at a much easier compare. So the first half of 2022 has over 30% growth. The second half of 2022 was down over 30%. So we\u2019re looking at a very different compare. The Americas is expected to decline the most as we saw in the first half of the year. EMEA to a lesser extent, and then APAC will perform the best, and we\u2019re expecting that for the year to decline like mid-single digits.\nMichael Griffin: Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please go ahead. Jade, your line is live sir. \nJade Rahmani: Thank you. M&A is always a fascinating topic yet. I know you can\u2019t say much. Can you say whether your focus is domestic or international?\nBob Sulentic: It\u2019s both, Jade. And I don\u2019t say that globally. We have good opportunities both here in the U.S. and internationally, and we have some opportunities that span the two. By the way, we had several questions today about the pace of M&A. The minute you start looking at acquiring companies that operate across multiple countries. That process takes a long time. And you have to make sure that you\u2019re confident, you can get regulatory approval across those countries that you can integrate across those countries that you can bring people along in a way that is motivating. And so I would say we have M&A opportunities that are specific to the U.S. and specific to countries outside the U.S., but importantly, we have opportunities to span countries, which is exciting. \nJade Rahmani: I wanted to also ask about AI if that\u2019s an area you want to invest in.\nBob Sulentic: We\u2019re looking \u2013 Emma mentioned our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli earlier. Vikram overseas or digital and technology team, which we\u2019ve advanced massively over the last few years. They have an initiative underway, and it would be \u2013 I think, Jade, our investors in CBRE would be happy with this. If you watched what we\u2019ve done with technology over the years, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re a real estate company that invests in technology to support our business, to enhance our business to enable our business.  We\u2019re looking at artificial intelligence in exactly the same way. We\u2019re not going into the artificial intelligence business. We\u2019re starting with trying to find places where artificial intelligence can make us more efficient and cost-effective and then \u2013 and we\u2019ll move from there to having it support our market-facing businesses. But there\u2019s a lot of hubris around AI now as I think most people would agree, and we\u2019re trying to stay clear of that and be very focused on where we can definitively help our business and invest in it as rational [ph] patient and an rational amount.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. The development in process pipeline ticked down a little bit in the second quarter, probably not a huge surprise. Given the current macro, would you expect that in-process pipeline to kind of be flattish for the next few quarters if it doesn\u2019t really make sense to kick off new projects?\nBob Sulentic: Flattish or potentially grow, Patrick, because what happens is they stay in process to you sell them. And if we start new projects that, they\u2019ll move from pipeline to in-process.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Got it. Thank you. And then Hana \u2013 at least Hana segment overhead is now a net positive to operating income over the past 12 months. What are your updated expectations and outlook for that business?\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Hana is kind of a net for us now is the best we could explain it. We\u2019ve invested in Industrious. That\u2019s our quote flex bet. It\u2019s a very good company. We\u2019re bullish on Flex as an opportunity. We\u2019ve got a 40% position with some additional debt in the business, and we\u2019re very supportive of Jamie Hodari and his team as they grow that business, and Hana is fading away.\nEmma Giamartino: And Patrick, I\u2019ll add just a reminder that when we invest in Industrious, we actually sold our operations, the core of our operations from Hana to Industrious. And so it Industrious operates all those properties today.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Bob Sulentic for closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we\u2019ll talk to you again at the end of the third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. On a consolidated basis, growth of our resilient lines of business continued during the quarter. Together, these businesses, which consist of our entire Global Workplace Solutions business, loan servicing, property management, valuation and the asset management component of investment management saw net revenue rise 10% in constant currency. Please turn to Slide 6 as I discuss our Advisory Services results. Weakness in capital markets had a pronounced effect on the advisory business. Advisory net revenue fell 21% against a challenging prior year comparison when net revenue grew by more than 20% versus Q2 2021. Our capital markets businesses, property sales and loan origination together saw revenue fell 44% versus a 13% increase in the prior year second quarter. In the Americas, property sales revenue fell 49% more than expected, reflecting limited credit availability and the gap between buyer and seller expectations. We are beginning to see an uptick in investor appetite for industrial assets where buyers will accept modest negative leverage due to the significant embedded rent gains over the past several years. In U.S. multifamily CBRE currently has $18 billion of deals in the market, more than double our volumes sold in the first half of the year. Sales revenue fell 43% in EMEA and 11% in APAC, both in local currency. We are increasingly well positioned in APAC. Notably, revenue in Japan has increased by 16% in local currency year-to-date, and this has become our most profitable advisory market outside the U.S. In contrast with Capital Markets, leasing performed in line with our expectations with revenue down 16% versus 40% growth in the prior year second quarter. The leasing decline was driven by the Americas. Leasing revenue grew in overseas markets as combined APAC and EMEA increased 6% in local currency. Among property types in the U.S., office was weakest with revenue down 30%, while Industrial was down only 10% against the challenging prior year comparison. Loan servicing revenues declined 6% and due to significant prepayment fees in the prior year. Excluding prepayments, loan servicing revenue increased by 6%. Prepayment fees fell significantly beginning in the third quarter of last year, so the prepayment headwind should diminish going forward. Valuation revenue declined 6% in the quarter in local currency, largely driven by our U.S. business. In the U.S., we perform a significant volume of work for financial institutions. This business has slowed down this year as investors pulled back from investment into commercial real estate. Property management net revenue rose 5% in local currency, increasing across most geographies with notable strength in Continental Europe and Southeast Asia. Turning to our GWS business on Slide 7. Net revenue increased 13% and SOP grew by 7% in the quarter, slightly exceeding our expectations. Growth was driven by the continued strength of our local business in the UK and expansion into the U.S. and an enterprise FM clients where we increased both the scope and geographic reach of our services. Demand for project management services also remained strong, led by our Turner & Townsend business. SOP margins declined from the prior year second quarter due to higher OpEx investments to support our local businesses, continued geographic expansion as well as costs associated with integrating recent acquisitions. Even though we expect these investments to continue through the balance of the year, full year SOP should be slightly better than we expected with the margin in line with last year's level. Our local business represents a tremendous growth opportunity, particularly in the U.S., which is expected to account for just 15% of this business lines net revenue this year. This business began with the Norland acquisition in late 2013. It has grown significantly from its original UK focus and net revenue is expected to grow by over 20% this year. Our pipeline remained elevated, more than 20% above the Q2 2022 level. The pipeline growth is driven by large first-generation outsourcers that are focused on lowering the real estate costs. Turning to our REI segment on Slide 8. As expected, SOP was down significantly versus the prior year when we generated a record SOP from this segment. Looking at the Investment Management business, nearly all of the operating profit decline was driven by lower incentive fees and modest co-investment losses versus co-investment gains in last year's second quarter. Assets under management fell by 1% driven by lower market valuations. The foundation of our IM business, which earns base fees on core and core plus assets remains healthy, and we expect co-investment gains and incentive fees to return when broader commercial real estate market conditions improve. Turning to development. We realized a modest operating loss. As we have discussed before, it is important to look at this business over the long term versus any particular quarter. Our highly flexible financing structure allows us to hold on to completed assets if we believe they can yield better returns in the future. And we continually evaluate our portfolio with that in mind. On a trailing 12-month basis, we generated $92 million in development and operating profit compared to $544 million in the prior 12 months, a period of record performance. Due to anticipated asset monetizations in Q4 of this year, we expect higher operating profits for the full year than we realized over the trailing 12-month period. As Bob mentioned, investors have begun to selectively deploy capital into development, favoring well-located industrial and residential projects. Our pipeline increased slightly during the quarter, positioning us well for a market recovery. Please turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of capital management and our balance sheet. During the quarter, we raised $1 billion of capital through a senior unsecured bond offering and shortly after quarter end, we raised an additional $350 million from refinancing and upsizing our euro term loan. We now have even more capacity to invest while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. We have a robust M&A pipeline and are evaluating multiple opportunities in the range of $1 billion. We expect these investments, if completed, will drive meaningful shareholder value. We did not repurchase any shares in Q2, but have repurchased $100 million of shares month-to-date. Looking at free cash flow, we had originally expected to generate just over $1 billion in 2023. We now expect this figure to be closer to $600 million to $800 million for two main reasons. First, as noted, our expectation for earnings has declined, which has a direct impact to cash flow. Second, the cost of Trammell Crow Company developments that are consolidated on our balance sheet as well as broker recruitment costs run free cash flow. We are seeing attractive opportunities to make targeted investments in both land acquisitions for future development and broker recruiting, and we now anticipate investing more in these two areas versus our expectation last quarter. I'll end with our updated outlook for 2023 on Slide 10. As Bob noted, we now expect core EPS to decline 20% to 25% from last year's record level, greater than the low to mid-double-digit decline we previously discussed. Our original outlook anticipated a low teens decline in advisory SOP, a low double-digit increase in GWS SOP and a nearly 30% decline in REI SOP coming off a year when our development business produced $330 million of operating profit. The incremental decline in our revised outlook is primarily driven by our view that the capital markets will not recover until next year. As a result, we expect lower investment sales and loan origination revenue than we anticipated 90 days ago and an extended time line to realize gains both in development and investment management. Looking at each segment, we now expect advisory SOP to decline by approximately 20% for the full year, a greater decline than we had been anticipating. In GWS, we now expect SOP to reach over $1 billion for the year or low-to-mid double-digit growth, slightly better than we previously expected, with the margin on net revenue in line with 2022 level. In REI, we now expect full year SOP in the low $300 million range, reflecting a 35% to 40% decline slightly worse than we previously expected. The primary driver is lower than anticipated co-investment gains and incentive fees in investment management as well as fewer development gains. We expect core EPS in the second half to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Beyond normal seasonality, we anticipate most development sales will take place in Q4, and the investments we're making in the growth of the GWS business will have an increasing benefit through the second half of the year. As such, we expect the fourth quarter to represent nearly three quarters of second half core EPS. With that, operator, we'll open the call for questions. Yes, Steve. So our focus for M&A and capital allocation over the next 12 months to 18 months is consistent with what we talked about last quarter. We continue to have a very strong pipeline across our M&A portfolio engagement has steadily increased across a number of deals as the year has progressed. And as we said before, we're looking across our portfolio of businesses, we're looking for opportunities to enhance our core offerings going forward. But the reality is that deals take time, and we're working on a number of them, and it takes even more time to do a very well-executed deal where we can underwrite to the level that we think are required to deliver a really strong return. So we're encouraged around where we are, and we continue to balance that with buybacks, and you can see us doing that through the rest of the year. Yes, Tony. So we're constantly balancing our capital allocation between buybacks and M&A and looking at our pipeline and the time \u2013 weighting the timing of when we think something may get executed. And so that's what you're seeing. Through the remainder of this year, we expect to complete about $600 million of buybacks in the second half. We've done $100 million in July. And that's what you're seeing there is we put a 10b5-1 in place, and that's really related to where our price goes. So as our price goes higher, we're buying back fewer shares as you'd naturally expect. So those are primarily in my remarks, I commented on. They're primarily related to our local business. We did a couple of acquisitions, smaller acquisitions, where we don't normalize integration costs. And you're seeing those integration costs in the quarter. You're also seeing investments in our local business as we expand that business outside of their current geographies. So there are some upfront costs required to build out those platforms. You're seeing that in this quarter, we expect that to steadily alleviate through the rest of the year and to end the year overall with the GWS margin in line with last year. And it's too early to comment on 2024, but I would expect those absent incremental investment, which we're always doing, our margins will improve going into 2024. I do want to comment a little bit on the local business because that is something that we haven't talked about extensively and is a really strong contributor to our growth, especially GWS's growth over time. That came out of the acquisition of Norland at the end of 2013, and it was primarily a UK-based company, and that's really how we entered the local or regional facilities management market. And when we acquired them, they had about $40 million of EBITDA. And today, they have about \u2013 we expect for the year, $230 million of EBITDA. So that's an exceptional growth story for us. And this year, we're expecting it to grow another 20%. But as I said, it requires investments over time to launch into new territories, but that will \u2013 we'll see operating leverage as those businesses grow. It's a combination of both. We're always looking for \u2013 we prefer a long-term capital source. So we've been looking for opportunities to raise that long-term capital. And what we did in the near term as we used those proceeds to pay down our revolver. We like having that flexibility and capacity on our revolver. The other positive from it is that our net interest rate once \u2013 after we raised the bond and expanded the term loan is actually lower than it was drawn on our revolver. So that's a positive impact, which should endure for the next couple of years. So specifically \u2013 first of all, I think it's important to look at our free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, and that's what I spoke to in my prepared remarks. And we're really focused on what we expect for the year, which is in that $600 million to $800 million range. In the quarter, specifically, what's been if you \u2013 what's been impacting the decline is primarily the decline in core net income. All of the adjustments, the cash adjustments that get you to free cash flow are pretty much in line with what you saw last year for the second quarter. No. Yes. So cost is something that we're consistently focused on. Our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, is consistently thinking about ways to drive cost management through our company. And we're moving from \u2013 this isn't an episodic event where we cut out a bunch of cross and then we move on. It's something that our leaders are constantly thinking about going forward. And what you're seeing right now is there is a balance of managing the business and the fixed cost for what's required just for our base foundation and our base platform and then investments that should drive future growth. So you mentioned broker recruiting. Those are investments that will drive future growth. The integration costs that I talked about within local are expanding into new territories. Those are investments that will drive future growth. So it's a constant balance. And we are through the second half of the year. Very focused on ensuring that, we are managing our cost base to an appropriate level for the growth that we're expecting going forward. Yes. On the sales front, it hasn't \u2013 I think overall, our expectations, as we said, have declined. A couple of things to note about the second half of the year. Overall, it we're looking at a much easier compare. So the first half of 2022 has over 30% growth. The second half of 2022 was down over 30%. So we're looking at a very different compare. The Americas is expected to decline the most as we saw in the first half of the year. EMEA to a lesser extent, and then APAC will perform the best, and we're expecting that for the year to decline like mid-single digits. And Patrick, I'll add just a reminder that when we invest in Industrious, we actually sold our operations, the core of our operations from Hana to Industrious. And so it Industrious operates all those properties today."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Like last quarter, CBRE's results slightly exceeded our expectations, driven largely by better-than-expected growth in Global Workplace Solutions and aggregate growth in our resilient lines of business, which Emma will describe in detail, offset by weaker-than-expected property sales and advisory services. It is notable when considering our performance that the prior year comparison was especially difficult. We had our best quarter ever for core earnings per share in last year's second quarter driven by exceptionally robust development earnings. To put this in perspective, our development earnings in last year's second quarter exceeded the level of development operating profit in any prior full year except 2021. With this in mind, my remarks this morning will largely focus on how both CBRE and the macro environment performed relative to our expectations coming into the quarter, followed by some high-level comments on our outlook. The economy performed better than we had anticipated going into the quarter in terms of both GDP and employment growth. However, the opposite was true with respect to interest rates, were increases in the last 90 days, coupled with expectations that rates will end the year higher than anticipated last quarter pressured the elements of our business that are sensitive to commercial real estate capital flows, particularly our sales and financing businesses, we expect this pressure to continue for the remainder of the year. At the same time, we are beginning to see signs in our own business that will eventually lead to improved performance likely starting next year. For example, we capitalized 10 new development projects during the second quarter versus only five projects in the prior two quarters combined. Our investment management team responsible for capital raising has noted a definitive change in investor sentiment in the last 90 days. Many of these investors remain cautious but are now exploring how they can take advantage of the reset in pricing as they develop their 2024 commitment plans. Looking ahead, we still anticipate a mild recession. However, we now expect the recession to occur at least one quarter later than we had previously thought, followed by a recovery beginning next year. We realize that our investors are closely watching the U.S. office market and bank exposure to commercial real estate loans. Our views regarding both are consistent with those we expressed at the end of the first quarter. We now expect full year 2023 core EPS to decline by 20% to 25% against last year's record level, with the majority of the decrease due to the delayed capital markets recovery. We continue to expect our resilient lines of business in aggregate to grow for the full year at a rate that is consistent with our expectations three months ago. Further, we believe there is a reasonable path to achieving a record level of core EPS in 2024. Although reaching that goal now has become more difficult with expected delay and the return of capital markets activity. Emma will now take you through a more detailed look at our performance for the quarter and provide additional insights on our outlook. Emma? It's three things, Steve. It's both of those things. It's the level of rates. It's the availability of debt, but it's also the mindset of buyers and sellers as to whether things have settled out and there is clarity about where cost \u2013 values of assets are going, cost of financing is going. So I think we had all three of those things burdening the market in the last 90 days. You said you thought it was a little better than you expected. In our view, it was a little worse than we expected. But we also think things are starting to clarify a bit. We are seeing things signs as we said in our prepared remarks that people are getting ready to act, which is good news. And we think things will sort out more with the banks now, and there'll be debt available from them, et cetera. So we're feeling better about where things are going to be, but we're probably going to see that happen next year. For sure. One thing that has become clear to us in the past quarter is that the \u2013 if we're going to have a recession, it's been delayed. Of course, the recovery related to that would then be delayed. And also, it's just crystal clear that the settling out of interest rates and the availability of debt has been delayed, which, again, is clearly reflected in what happened in our quarter and clearly reflected in what we've said about the rest of the year. Yes. Tony, the \u2013 I think the thing that is really important to note, and Emma already alluded to it is \u2013 we are talking about big M&A deals now. We're $1 billion deals, and we're working on a number of them. We've had a steady stream of smaller infill deals. Big deals kind of take on a life of their own. You have to get through agreeing with the other party on a deal, working through an integration plan, working through an agreement that then becomes a definitive agreement and those things ebb and flow. And the notion that they would \u2013 you would talk about in one quarter and then with high confidence they would land in the next quarter. That's just not how bigger deals play out. I will tell you 90 days after we last talked about it, are view of our M&A opportunity is as strong as it was then. We've got several things we're working on. They're not going to all make we're confident though that some things will make and that it will be a very productive use of capital for us over the next few quarters and it will be a very good strategic use of capital for us, which aren't exactly the same thing. We think we're going to be able to move our business forward strategically very nicely with some of the things we're working on. Yes. Tony, when we talk about recruiting and retention, it's heavily skewed toward our brokerage business. And our brokerage business is experiencing a good year and an active year of recruiting. And we think it's going to measure up with some of the best years we've ever had. Recruiting \u2013 even in a tough market, recruiting is expensive because what you're typically doing is recruiting the best brokers in the marketplace, and it's like buying great companies. They never come cheap. But we're at a time now where people are finding their platforms and the circumstances in the companies they're in today being less supportive of what they want to do with their careers less supportive of how they want to support their clients than they think CBRE can be. So we're finding good hunting out there in a lot of places in bringing on people and as a result, spending more money. It's a little bit like Emma said about the land situation with Trammell Crow Company. There's a lot of people out there that previously, we're able to buy land, industrial land or multifamily land that aren't in a great position to buy it now. It's not cheap. You still have to pay up to get good land. But you can get some land sites that you couldn't get previously. You can get some brokers you couldn't get previously. And that's what Emma's comments were centered on about the incremental use of cash for those two types of investments into the future. Yes. Jade, that's an interesting story. And by the way, it's a story that's being pulled increasingly, and it's this bifurcation between really good buildings and other buildings that are less attractive from an experience point of view for tenants. And what we've seen in New York, in particular, is that companies that want to get their people back into the office and believe it's important, are very, very interested in getting the best possible space to create the best environment for those tenants to get them in. So there's actually a little bit of a feeding frenzy for the best space in a place like Midtown Manhattan. In fact, I had a conversation with our senior most brokers, and we have 125 or so of them that qualify for this, we call Vice Chairman. And we have a Vice Chairman in New York, that focuses mainly on hedge funds, investment companies, et cetera, in Midtown Manhattan. He told me a couple of weeks ago that this is going to be his best year ever in leasing, which is kind of at odds with everything you're hearing about return to the office, the attractiveness of office space. But what it is, it's those clients wanting to gobble up the best space, and by the way, at record rental rates so they can create this environment for their people. So we are going to see this circumstance continue to play out where the best buildings do quite well. And the buildings at the bottom really, really struggled in between, you're going to see buildings repurpose because that \u2013 in the absence of those buildings in the middle being repurposed and moved up the spectrum in terms of their quality, there aren't going to be places for these companies to go when they do want to create this environment for their people. By the way, it's one of the things that is a bit of an encouraging sign for companies like us who provide a lot of services to office buildings over the longer run. We definitely expect monetization of our Trammell Crow assets to pick up if, in fact, cap rates perform well. And if, in fact, there's capital availability for buyers, one of the really great things about that business \u2013 and just to remind everybody, we have $17 billion of product in development now, and we have another $13 billion behind that in the pipeline. Those are projects that we have control over, but we haven't started to develop yet. We have those projects capitalized in a way that we have flexibility over when we harvest them. So if you look at a quarter like this, I think Emma, we sold one building in Q3 \u2013 excuse me, Q2, we just decided this is not a good time to be selling our assets. And that positions us well for profitability in the future when the time comes to sell those assets. We've got really strong equity partners. We've got a little of our own equity in them. We've got flexible debt financing. So I think that business is positioned to do very good things for us later next year and beyond when the capital markets come back around. Well, Michael, we don't want to be too specific about where we see them. I will tell you, we are pursuing M&A opportunities that we think do a couple of things. Number one, they advance our ability to serve our clients in areas where we think we're not as strong as we'd like to be. Number two; they are really well-run companies that we, in some cases, will bring leaders in to run parts of our business with those acquisitions. And they \u2013 when we announced some of these things, they'll sound kind of consistent with what people might have expected.  And some of what we're doing will sound different than what people might have expected. When we \u2013 Emma talked about the Norland acquisition, which has been one of the great ones we made. I don't think anybody would have expected that acquisition a few years ago. We had grown to the point where it made sense to buy that company. We've had others like that. And I think you should expect to see M&A from us that will expand our capability to serve our company with really well-run companies with really good brands. And if we can't get those kind of deals done, we're not going to do M&A. We're not going to force it just to build scale. We can build scale through organic growth. It's both, Jade. And I don't say that globally. We have good opportunities both here in the U.S. and internationally, and we have some opportunities that span the two. By the way, we had several questions today about the pace of M&A. The minute you start looking at acquiring companies that operate across multiple countries. That process takes a long time. And you have to make sure that you're confident, you can get regulatory approval across those countries that you can integrate across those countries that you can bring people along in a way that is motivating. And so I would say we have M&A opportunities that are specific to the U.S. and specific to countries outside the U.S., but importantly, we have opportunities to span countries, which is exciting. We're looking \u2013 Emma mentioned our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli earlier. Vikram overseas or digital and technology team, which we've advanced massively over the last few years. They have an initiative underway, and it would be \u2013 I think, Jade, our investors in CBRE would be happy with this. If you watched what we've done with technology over the years, we've said we're a real estate company that invests in technology to support our business, to enhance our business to enable our business.  We're looking at artificial intelligence in exactly the same way. We're not going into the artificial intelligence business. We're starting with trying to find places where artificial intelligence can make us more efficient and cost-effective and then \u2013 and we'll move from there to having it support our market-facing businesses. But there's a lot of hubris around AI now as I think most people would agree, and we're trying to stay clear of that and be very focused on where we can definitively help our business and invest in it as rational [ph] patient and an rational amount. Flattish or potentially grow, Patrick, because what happens is they stay in process to you sell them. And if we start new projects that, they'll move from pipeline to in-process. Yes. Hana is kind of a net for us now is the best we could explain it. We've invested in Industrious. That's our quote flex bet. It's a very good company. We're bullish on Flex as an opportunity. We've got a 40% position with some additional debt in the business, and we're very supportive of Jamie Hodari and his team as they grow that business, and Hana is fading away. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the third quarter."

I'm joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our President and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic : Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were slightly better than we expected going into the year, but still down significantly from last year's strong first quarter. Our performance relative to our expectations was led by the cyclically resilient elements of our business and our cost management efforts, which more than offset a greater-than-expected decline in property sales.  The elements of our business that are cyclically resilient include our entire GWS business, loan servicing, property management, valuations and asset management fees from our investment management business. Combined, these businesses saw revenue increase nearly 10% during the first quarter and are expected to account for more than 50% of our business segment operating profit for the year, a record high.  With this increased diversification, our business is more resilient, but current conditions are difficult for capital markets and getting more difficult for leasing. There are three major reasons for these difficulties. First, inflation, elevated interest rates and the likelihood of a recession. Second, banking system stress and third, issue specific to the return to office and office utilization. I'll address each of these.  We are aligned with the consensus view that the economy will tip into a recession later this year. We believe it will be a moderate recession and that an eventual easing of the Fed's monetary policy will spur a rebound in economic activity in 2024. The comments Emma and I make today and our responses to questions will be shaped by that view. The high-profile regional bank failures last month have further constrained lending. However, we are not in another global financial crisis when all debt capital source is contracted simultaneously. Regional banks are still lending to commercial real estate but on a much more selective basis. We expect the regional bank pullback to be partly offset by other capital sources, including the GSEs, debt funds and private capital sources.  Looking at the office market, we estimate it will take this asset class twice as long to recover the lost value as it did in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This reflects the formidable challenges facing office assets, driven by both the slow progress employees return to office and the shedding of jobs in tech and other sectors. Ultimately, we believe that office portfolios will shrink meaningfully from where they were prior to the pandemic, making offices a smaller but still very large commercial real estate asset class. Even with these legitimate concerns in line, we believe sentiment has deteriorated more than the fundamentals that underpin our business. This pattern is typical with commercial real estate investors and occupiers, becoming overly bearish in anticipation of and during early stages of a down cycle. It is our view that debt cost and cap rates are likely near their peak and should gradually improve starting later this year, driving a turnaround that will significantly impact 2024 performance.  To expand on my earlier remarks regarding the growing resilience in our business, our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which generated more than $900 million of segment operating profit over the past 12 months, is expected to grow by double digits this year. In total, our cyclically resilient business lines, including GWS, produced approximately $1.5 billion of segment operating profit over the past 12 months and we expect them to grow in aggregate by high single digits this year. It's also important to note that we have become much less dependent on office properties, which accounted for just 14% of U.S. property sales revenue in 2022. Other asset classes where we have large businesses will be more resilient. For instance, we expect valuations for industrial and multifamily to fully recover in two to three years, less than half the time it took coming out of the global financial crisis.  Although we anticipate pressure on our transactional businesses to intensify further this year, we are maintaining our earnings outlook for full year 2023. Emma will discuss this in detail during her remarks. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino : Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, the diversification of our business and rigorous financial discipline were key to producing Q1 results that were slightly better than the expectations we set forth for each of our segments in late February, despite some market environment becoming more challenging.  I'll review each segment now, starting with Advisory Services on Slide 6. Results in the first quarter were supported by stability in our valuations, loan servicing and property management lines of business, with revenue relatively flat compared to prior year. We also benefited from cost mitigation efforts, we initiated last year that decreased advisory operating expenses by 2.5%. So these benefits were offset by a greater decline in our property sales business than expected. Capital markets, property sales and loan origination combined declined 40%, a slightly greater decline than expectations.  Within property sales, all major reasons saw revenue decline with Asia-Pacific performing the best, down 30%, and the Americas falling more than 40%. Most sales activity today involves industrial and multifamily properties with office understandably drawing little capital activity. Significant capital is ready to be deployed, but we do not expect activity to improve until borrowing costs decline and market pricing clarity improved. Leasing revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations against the nearly 50% increase in the first quarter last year. Across geographies, leasing performance diverged, with the Americas down 10% and EMEA down 5% and APAC up 26%, all in local currency. This is consistent with our expectations for non-U.S. markets, especially APAC, to perform relatively better in light of regional economic outlooks and improved office utilization levels. Now please turn to Slide 7. Our GWS business continues to grow impressively with both facilities management and project management net revenue up by double digits, exceeding our expectations. Growth was driven by several of the large facilities management contract wins achieved last year and strong organic growth within project management, driven by large project mandates.  Our pipeline of new business reached a record level at the end of the first quarter as both existing clients and first-generation outsourcers are increasingly focused on cost reduction. GWS's margin on net revenue of 10.8% was in line with our expectations and will improve throughout the year as our cost reduction efforts to phase in. Please turn to Slide 8. Overall, REI results met our expectations, and we continue to expect full year results to meet our original guidance. Q1 development results were supported by large asset sales, which occurred in January, consistent with what we discussed last quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect our asset sales to be heavily weighted to industrial projects such as monetized in the fourth quarter.  We have pulled back only slightly on planned construction starts for 2023. We do anticipate that well-conceived projects we got in the current environment will come online in supply-constrained markets, most notably for industrial. For the same reason, we are focused on carefully building our land position so that we can benefit from a first-mover advantage coming out of the downturn, a position that has historically provided significant rewards. Additionally, our Telford UK development business is tracking in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect improvement from 2022 results. Within Investment Management, profit was roughly flat versus prior year, excluding the mark-to-market impact on our co-investment portfolio, which was a significant positive in the prior year. For context, co-investment gains made up less than 1% of this business line's operating profit in the trailing 12 months. AUM declined modestly from the fourth quarter as net capital inflows and foreign currency effects offset most of the loss of market value. Turning to Slide 9. We believe the current environment is an attractive time to deploy capital. Our M&A pipeline is strong with multiple attractive opportunities, some large that could transform CBRE's existing offerings and drive meaningful shareholder value. We reduced share repurchases in the quarter as we continue to evaluate these opportunities. If we are unable to convert our larger pursuits we will accelerate our share repurchase activity well above Q1 levels. In any event, we expect to deploy more capital in the next 12 months than in the prior 12 months while maintaining an appropriately conservative level of leverage.  We expect to generate in excess of $1 billion of free cash flow this year. When combining this expected free cash flow with our lightly levered balance sheet, we could invest as much as $5.5 billion this year, while maintaining leverage below 2 turns. I'll conclude with our outlook. Our original 2023 outlook contemplated our recovery from the current downturn in the back half of the year. We now expect a delayed recovery due to more constrained debt liquidity and heightened market uncertainties. Our sales and leasing businesses are most impacted by the changed economic environment. And as a result, we now anticipate property sales to fall by nearly 20%, which would represent a more than 25% decline from peak 2021 levels.  We also expect leasing activity to be down by high single digits this year. As Bob indicated, we are maintaining our full year outlook, with core earnings per share expected to decline by low- to mid-double digits this year. Stronger growth than we originally anticipated in our resilient lines of business described earlier and incremental cost reduction efforts will largely offset the impact of our weaker outlook for capital markets and leasing transactions. However, there is more uncertainty in this outlook than there was when we first presented it in late February. We continue to expect core EPS to exceed the prior peak in 2024. And as a reminder, our outlook is informed by our view that there will be a moderate recession this year, followed by a rebound in economic activity in 2024 as the Fed reduces interest rates. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions.\nQ - Chandni Luthra : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to talk about capital allocation first. So what are the segments that are most attractive to you from an M&A standpoint? Bob, Emma, could you give us a sense of multiples and perhaps size of the deal, say, with respect to Turner & Townsend, which was one of the biggest deals you've done in recent past. And help us understand if are looking at one large transformative deal? Or is it going to be a cocktail of smaller M&A transactions.\nEmma Giamartino : Yeah, Chandni, so we are looking for opportunities across our segments where we can enhance the offerings that we currently have. And we are looking at multiple deals that are larger than what we've typically done. So on the larger side of both Turner & Townsend.  And in terms of the segments that we're focused on, it's facilities management, it's investment management, and it's our resilient lines of business within advisory such as valuation. So we're looking across all three segments, and we are looking for, when we say transformational, it's needle moving something that can change the profile of our existing businesses. These aren't businesses that are completely new to CBRE. We have extremely high rating standards. As you can imagine, you asked about multiple across those three segments. The multiples are different, but we are looking for highly accretive deals that can generate returns and shareholder value well above what we could do with buybacks alone.  And I do want to underscore that M&A can move in multiple directions, and we are hopeful that we'll convert at least a large deal in our pipeline. But if we don't do that, we will accelerate our share repurchases. And as I said in my remarks, we intend to deploy as much capital as we -- in the next 12 months as we did in the last 12 months. And as a reminder, that was just over $2 billion of capital deployed.\nChandni Luthra : And a quick follow-up to that. As you think about 2023 guidance, there is M&A part of this unchanged guidance?\nEmma Giamartino : It is not. It is not. And what I'd say about that is both buybacks and M&A done towards the end of the year will not have a meaningful impact to 2023 results. That impact will flow into 2024.\nChandni Luthra : Got it. And then for my second question, you obviously cut set guidance for transactions and leasing, but you maintained your EPS guidance for 2023 and also sort of 2024. So give us your thought process behind this comfort, like how much of this unchanged EPS guidance is from noncyclical components performing better versus you leaning into more cost cuts in the business? And what are those incremental cost reduction efforts that you're now contemplating that you perhaps weren't when you printed 4Q results and the world was a little bit. Thank you.\nEmma Giamartino : So Chandni, that's actually a really important question. I'd say, high level, the reduction from our revised on the ground sales and leasing revenue is having about a 3% impact to our far outlook for EPS for the full year, and that is being offset by a combination of higher growth in GWS and cost mitigation efforts or cost avoidance efforts in REI and advisory.\nChandni Luthra : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Now our question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah, thanks. Good morning Bob, Emma, I guess, could you just talk a little bit about the transaction business. And I'm just curious, Bob, is it -- do you think the absolute rates is for being 5% plus a spread that's putting borrowing costs in the in that's creating it? Or do you think it's more the availability of credit today that's creating an issue in the transaction market.\nBob Sulentic : Steve, it's both of those things. It's the absolute rates, it's the availability of credit, but it's a third thing, and that is the uncertainty about where things are going to go. And we think later this year, all three of those things will start to move in a direction that's helpful to our business. We think rates will stabilize, possibly come down more capital more debt and equity will become available. And the combination of those two things will create more certainty around pricing, and we think that transactions will start to happen again on the capital market side.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And I don't remember if it was the last quarter or maybe the quarter before. I know you had sort of talked about a longer range EPS target, I think, in the $8 to $9 range. And I believe that time frame had been pushed out maybe more like the '26 or '27 from maybe that was originally '25. I'm just curious, as you look out over the next, say, three to five years, how do you sort of think about that $8 to $9 figure? And is that time frame of '26- '27 still realistic?\nBob Sulentic : We talked about that at the end of the year, which, by the way, that was only 60 days ago, roughly. And our long-term view is not altered by what we've seen so far this year. Of course, we'll address that again next year when we have the benefit of the full year view. But our long-term view for the prospects of the business are good.  And of course, part of those -- the long term is the short term, I will say what we've seen in the short term is challenged in one sense, the transactions, but in the other sense, our enthusiasm for and belief in these -- what we're calling these resilient businesses, particularly GWS. And also what we're seeing in the M&A space where we have become a more interesting buyer to a good number of companies than we have been historically. There are companies out there in our sector or directly adjacent to our sector that believe by becoming part of our business or having financial sponsorship from our business will help them perform better than they could perform on their own. And this is not a circumstance that's going on in the same way with other companies in our sector. We think we have a distinct advantage there. And that's going to be a more material part of our future, we believe now that you would have heard from us certainly in the past.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That's it for me. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Paolone : Thanks. And I guess the first one for you, Bob, just on this capital allocation, M&A and just where the business is going to that point, if you look out two or three years, where do you think the biggest shift in revenue mix is for you all? Do you think it's by property type, geography or business line? Just any thoughts on how to think about that?\nBob Sulentic : Well, there'll be shifts across all of those. So by geography, our business is definitively becoming larger on a relative basis in Asia-Pacific, Asia specifically than it has been historically. I'll give you an example. In the advisory business, forever, our second biggest business was the UK behind the United States, and there wasn't anything close. Our business in Japan now is roughly the same size as our business in the UK.  For sure, we're growing our businesses related to the multifamily and industrial asset classes. We're not the only ones doing that, but that's a definitive part of what we're doing. And then the outsourcing business, which includes us providing facilities management and project management and portfolio services work, mostly for big corporates focused on saving them money, working on their net zero initiatives, shedding assets in some cases. That business will be an enduring double-digit grower and probably not low double digits. We think there's an opportunity to have that be mid-double digits.  And when I made my comments a minute ago about companies being increasingly interested in having us be their acquirer or us investing in them, a lot of that happens in that segment. So that's kind of where we see the shift happening across our businesses.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay. Thanks. And then just on the leasing side, you noted just the step down that's unfolding there. I think the office side of it, I think everybody probably understands pretty well. But do you see any other parts of leasing cracking either geographically or by property type that's of note, like industrial has been pretty strong, but maybe a little bit more color there. And I think even like retail in Europe, you called it out and I think your release as having been pretty good.\nBob Sulentic : Yeah, retail leasing is good. And by the way, retail rental rates are growing up because there's a big experience thing going on here across the U.S. and around the world that is causing retailers of various types, including food and beverage. But obviously, the high-end retailers doing quite well, and that's helping our leasing business in retail.  Industrial's been white hot over the last couple of years, and it's just not going to stay that hot indefinitely. That's been a little bit anomalistic. And so we are seeing a little bit of downward pressure on industrial leasing. But we think over the longer term, industrial leasing will be very, very strong. And the dynamics driving logistics space around the world will remain in place. But we are seeing some downward pressure on that for sure this year.\nAnthony Paolone : Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nJade Rahmani : Thank you very much. On commercial real estate as an asset class, we're at an interesting time because for as long as I've covered the space, the institutional allocation to commercial real estate has continually increased, and this is the first year, as I remember, where it's decreasing. And at the same time, the ground is clearly shifting with office, and office historically represents a scaled way to deploy capital in the space. Otherwise, you're buying very small assets. It's very hard to get to scale.  So do any of those dynamics affect in your view the long-term secular trend of institutionalization in commercial real estate and the attractiveness of the asset class overall.\nBob Sulentic : In aggregate, Jade, I don't think so. And I'll tell you why I say that. First of all, what you're seeing now isn't driven largely by commercial real estate being out of favor. It's not even in the biggest sense being driven by office buildings being out of favor. It's being driven by the denominator effect.  The base of assets around the world is growing. The base of industrial space around the world is growing. The base of institutional quality multifamily around the world is growing, et cetera. And we think that's going to continue. And we think when stock prices rebound, the denominator effect will go in the other direction.  The other thing I would tell you about office space, which has been a big home for capital, there's a tendency when things turn to think that they're going to turn and disappear. Our view is that the portfolios that companies have the office space, not the investors in office space, but the companies that use it that ultimately drive the investment in office space will shrink materially. But it will still be an enormous asset class. If it's down 20% or 10% or 15%, whatever it settles down, it will still be an enormous asset class.  And the future of office space is still being sorted out. We may be more back in the office in the future than we are today. That's just an unknown. But that will be a very large asset class. That will be a very big home for institutional capital in the future, but certainly, other asset classes will and there's all retail and industrial, hotels, multifamily, huge asset classes and look what's going on with hotels.  I mean try to get a hotel room at a rational pre-COVID rate right now anywhere in a good hotel and that you just can't do it. And so I don't think commercial real estate as an asset class is going to decline in importance at all in the future.\nJade Rahmani : Thank you very much for that. I wanted to ask about this. Again, I don't know if it's a pipe dream I have, but I could envision CBRE going in a direction where infrastructure really becomes essentially a new leg in the stool, a new standalone segment and you really broaden the suite of services you provide to governments, to agencies and client mitigation becomes an extremely large strategic opportunity. So do you see infrastructure as one of those potential transformational type deals, it probably also would be accretive to CBRE's overall multiples since we've enhanced resiliency that sector being less cyclical and having a lot of secular growth potential.\nBob Sulentic : Jade, there's two areas of our business now where we do meaningful work in infrastructure. We have an investment management business that invests in infrastructure. And with the acquisition of 60% of Turner & Townsend, which by the way, has continued to outperform our expectations. They have a significant infrastructure and significant green energy business, and they do large projects subject to very long-term contracts around the world.  We would expect those businesses to grow and provide incremental opportunity to us in the long run. What we might do beyond that is a long run circumstance that we're not really prepared to talk about at this point, but we do have positive exposure in both those areas.\nJade Rahmani: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Griffin : Great. Thanks. Bob, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about how you expect GWS to grow in the high single digits. I think last quarter, it was pegged at about low double digits. Maybe I misheard this, but if that's the case, why would that be? I presume that these are sort of stickier, more resilient business lines. So anything you could add on that would be great.\nBob Sulentic : Yeah, Michael. What I said was that we expect the total of our cyclically resilient business is to grow in the high single digits. So that would be GWS valuations, property management the fee portion of our investment management business, we expect our GWS business to grow well into the double digits.\nMichael Griffin : Got you. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on office, particularly on potential refinancings and debt coming due. I think we've seen some news recently about some debt availability for maybe less than trophy class properties. And I think library office asset need might suggest at least a data point that I saw that there is debt out there. Are you seeing this particularly on the office side? I mean I think the expectation is for trophy buildings to have financing, but maybe some of that not the absolute top of the market stuff might be harder to finance.\nBob Sulentic : Yeah. Well, trophy buildings both in the current environment and in the long term are going to do quite well in our view. Because with all that's going on, on the return to the office circumstance, companies are looking for great environments for their employees. We're doing it for our own headquarters in our own offices around the U.S. and around the world. Virtually, all of our clients are doing it. And these -- so these great buildings are going to do well.  B and C buildings are going to be challenged, and there is less capital available for them. But I think there's an overreaction to that circumstance. The press -- it's like so many things. It's a great story to talk about how bad something is when it gets bad, the fact of the matter is, coming out of the financial crisis, office buildings were capitalized much more conservatively than they had been historically, more equity in office buildings than there had been previously. If you look at the banking system today, something like 1.5% of commercial or commercial banks asset portfolio is in office buildings. It's not a huge threatening circumstance. Some of the problem assets will go back to the bank. Some of them will get restructured and worked out as is always the case with troubled assets. So it's going to be hard to refinance some of those assets and some of those assets are going to become troubled and go back. But it's not going to be an overwhelming circumstance the way certain headlines would suggest it might be.\nMichael Griffin : Great. That's helpful. And then just last one. I think Emma might have mentioned the Telford acquisition tracking in line with expectations. The UK, I believe it's a single-family business. Obviously, we've seen over here in the states, worries around the regulatory front and maybe some single-family companies. Is there any worry that similar regulations could come down the pipe in the UK? Or is it just kind of a very different business model.\nEmma Giamartino : Michael, I just want to clarify, our Telford business is a multifamily business, it's shifting towards build-to-rent multifamily.\nMichael Griffin : Okay. And is there any way around regulation on that? I mean we've seen some of the apartment companies, whether it's rent regulation, stuff like that, any concerns?\nEmma Giamartino : No, no. We don't have any concerns. And we actually see -- when we initially made that investment, we saw a secular tailwind in builder in the UK that continues to exist. And so we expect that business to continue to grow going forward.\nMichael Griffin : Awesome. That's it for me. Thanks for your time. \nBob Sulentic : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Sheldon : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Really impressive trends. GWS this quarter sounds like there is confidence in continued double-digit growth there. In that context, I think there has been at least some concern that with companies reducing their office real estate footprint that it could become a headwind to growth in GWS at some point if contract scopes get reduced.  So be curious if you're concerned about that at all? Or is the business so diversified by different asset classes and the industry still so fragmented and so early in outsourcing adoption that you're not worried about the growth trajectory at GWS over the medium term. I guess how do you think about that?\nBob Sulentic : Stephen, corporates reducing their office footprint is a headwind for that business. And by the way, has been a headwind for that business for the last 15 years. The average square foot per person that corporates use has been going down and down and down and we've been helping them with that. We've been helping them reconfigure their portfolios. We've been helping them do project work in support of that. And the project work they need now with the kind of space they're trying to deliver for their employees is really important.  So yes, that will be a headwind in terms of the amount of space that we might manage for individual corporates. But other work we would do for them will offset that. But the thing kind of overwhelms that circumstance is that more corporates are bringing us on new clients are bringing us on to help them create environments for their employees to help them save money, both in terms of the size of their footprint, the operation of their facilities to help them move toward a more energy-efficient environment and certainly now with Turner & Townsend, that puts us in a better place to do that.  So the net of all those dynamics is that this is going to be a double-digit growing business. And again, that's before some of the acquisition opportunities that we're seeing that are becoming more prominent for us because -- partly because we want to do it, but partly because companies that might combine with us are finding us more interesting than they used to.\nStephen Sheldon : Very helpful. And then just a follow-up. You've given some good detail on the 2024 kind of commentary. But on 2024 core EPS surpassing the prior peak, which is 2022. Is the planned capital deployment a big factor in that, whether it's accretive M&A or share repurchase activity? Or would you still expect to surpass prior peak in 2024 without a big ramp in capital deployment?\nEmma Giamartino : There's very little capital deployment in that plan to exceed prior peak EPS in 2024. Any capital allocation buybacks and M&A would help us surpass that even to a greater extent. And I do want to emphasize that getting to 2024 -- in 2024 getting to that record EPS level, we believe it is very achievable. It takes relatively conservative assumptions to get there for both a rebound in our advisory and our transactional business lines, both in REI and advisory. We don't have to get back to 2021 levels in those businesses to get to the direct EPS.  And then within GWS. If you are in the very low double-digit range, we can still get to that record EPS level. And that again, that's all without meaningful capital allocation.\nStephen Sheldon : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy : Hey, good morning. So obviously, debt financing is really challenging right now in commercial real estate. What sort of role do you see for private credit in commercial real estate financing going forward?\nBob Sulentic : Well, I can tell you, Patrick, it won't be surprising to you to hear me say that we interface a lot with the private equity folks in commercial real estate who are customers of ours that might be participants in this. And the view is that this is going to be a big opportunity for them. When there's a lack of supply coming from other areas, people come in and backfill and create opportunities for themselves in that area, and we think that's going to happen here.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy : Got it. Thank you. And then you spoke earlier about market pricing clarity serving as a catalyst for improved capital markets transactions. But what's the catalyst for that market pricing clarity to actually happen?\nBob Sulentic : Interest rates to stabilize and come down are the biggest factor there, and we think that's going to happen later this year.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy : Great, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Bob Sulentic for any closing comments.\nBob Sulentic : Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again a quarter from now when we report our second quarter results.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. As Bob mentioned, the diversification of our business and rigorous financial discipline were key to producing Q1 results that were slightly better than the expectations we set forth for each of our segments in late February, despite some market environment becoming more challenging.  I'll review each segment now, starting with Advisory Services on Slide 6. Results in the first quarter were supported by stability in our valuations, loan servicing and property management lines of business, with revenue relatively flat compared to prior year. We also benefited from cost mitigation efforts, we initiated last year that decreased advisory operating expenses by 2.5%. So these benefits were offset by a greater decline in our property sales business than expected. Capital markets, property sales and loan origination combined declined 40%, a slightly greater decline than expectations.  Within property sales, all major reasons saw revenue decline with Asia-Pacific performing the best, down 30%, and the Americas falling more than 40%. Most sales activity today involves industrial and multifamily properties with office understandably drawing little capital activity. Significant capital is ready to be deployed, but we do not expect activity to improve until borrowing costs decline and market pricing clarity improved. Leasing revenue declined 8%, in line with expectations against the nearly 50% increase in the first quarter last year. Across geographies, leasing performance diverged, with the Americas down 10% and EMEA down 5% and APAC up 26%, all in local currency. This is consistent with our expectations for non-U.S. markets, especially APAC, to perform relatively better in light of regional economic outlooks and improved office utilization levels. Now please turn to Slide 7. Our GWS business continues to grow impressively with both facilities management and project management net revenue up by double digits, exceeding our expectations. Growth was driven by several of the large facilities management contract wins achieved last year and strong organic growth within project management, driven by large project mandates.  Our pipeline of new business reached a record level at the end of the first quarter as both existing clients and first-generation outsourcers are increasingly focused on cost reduction. GWS's margin on net revenue of 10.8% was in line with our expectations and will improve throughout the year as our cost reduction efforts to phase in. Please turn to Slide 8. Overall, REI results met our expectations, and we continue to expect full year results to meet our original guidance. Q1 development results were supported by large asset sales, which occurred in January, consistent with what we discussed last quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect our asset sales to be heavily weighted to industrial projects such as monetized in the fourth quarter.  We have pulled back only slightly on planned construction starts for 2023. We do anticipate that well-conceived projects we got in the current environment will come online in supply-constrained markets, most notably for industrial. For the same reason, we are focused on carefully building our land position so that we can benefit from a first-mover advantage coming out of the downturn, a position that has historically provided significant rewards. Additionally, our Telford UK development business is tracking in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect improvement from 2022 results. Within Investment Management, profit was roughly flat versus prior year, excluding the mark-to-market impact on our co-investment portfolio, which was a significant positive in the prior year. For context, co-investment gains made up less than 1% of this business line's operating profit in the trailing 12 months. AUM declined modestly from the fourth quarter as net capital inflows and foreign currency effects offset most of the loss of market value. Turning to Slide 9. We believe the current environment is an attractive time to deploy capital. Our M&A pipeline is strong with multiple attractive opportunities, some large that could transform CBRE's existing offerings and drive meaningful shareholder value. We reduced share repurchases in the quarter as we continue to evaluate these opportunities. If we are unable to convert our larger pursuits we will accelerate our share repurchase activity well above Q1 levels. In any event, we expect to deploy more capital in the next 12 months than in the prior 12 months while maintaining an appropriately conservative level of leverage.  We expect to generate in excess of $1 billion of free cash flow this year. When combining this expected free cash flow with our lightly levered balance sheet, we could invest as much as $5.5 billion this year, while maintaining leverage below 2 turns. I'll conclude with our outlook. Our original 2023 outlook contemplated our recovery from the current downturn in the back half of the year. We now expect a delayed recovery due to more constrained debt liquidity and heightened market uncertainties. Our sales and leasing businesses are most impacted by the changed economic environment. And as a result, we now anticipate property sales to fall by nearly 20%, which would represent a more than 25% decline from peak 2021 levels.  We also expect leasing activity to be down by high single digits this year. As Bob indicated, we are maintaining our full year outlook, with core earnings per share expected to decline by low- to mid-double digits this year. Stronger growth than we originally anticipated in our resilient lines of business described earlier and incremental cost reduction efforts will largely offset the impact of our weaker outlook for capital markets and leasing transactions. However, there is more uncertainty in this outlook than there was when we first presented it in late February. We continue to expect core EPS to exceed the prior peak in 2024. And as a reminder, our outlook is informed by our view that there will be a moderate recession this year, followed by a rebound in economic activity in 2024 as the Fed reduces interest rates. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. Yeah, Chandni, so we are looking for opportunities across our segments where we can enhance the offerings that we currently have. And we are looking at multiple deals that are larger than what we've typically done. So on the larger side of both Turner & Townsend.  And in terms of the segments that we're focused on, it's facilities management, it's investment management, and it's our resilient lines of business within advisory such as valuation. So we're looking across all three segments, and we are looking for, when we say transformational, it's needle moving something that can change the profile of our existing businesses. These aren't businesses that are completely new to CBRE. We have extremely high rating standards. As you can imagine, you asked about multiple across those three segments. The multiples are different, but we are looking for highly accretive deals that can generate returns and shareholder value well above what we could do with buybacks alone.  And I do want to underscore that M&A can move in multiple directions, and we are hopeful that we'll convert at least a large deal in our pipeline. But if we don't do that, we will accelerate our share repurchases. And as I said in my remarks, we intend to deploy as much capital as we -- in the next 12 months as we did in the last 12 months. And as a reminder, that was just over $2 billion of capital deployed. It is not. It is not. And what I'd say about that is both buybacks and M&A done towards the end of the year will not have a meaningful impact to 2023 results. That impact will flow into 2024. So Chandni, that's actually a really important question. I'd say, high level, the reduction from our revised on the ground sales and leasing revenue is having about a 3% impact to our far outlook for EPS for the full year, and that is being offset by a combination of higher growth in GWS and cost mitigation efforts or cost avoidance efforts in REI and advisory. Michael, I just want to clarify, our Telford business is a multifamily business, it's shifting towards build-to-rent multifamily. No, no. We don't have any concerns. And we actually see -- when we initially made that investment, we saw a secular tailwind in builder in the UK that continues to exist. And so we expect that business to continue to grow going forward. There's very little capital deployment in that plan to exceed prior peak EPS in 2024. Any capital allocation buybacks and M&A would help us surpass that even to a greater extent. And I do want to emphasize that getting to 2024 -- in 2024 getting to that record EPS level, we believe it is very achievable. It takes relatively conservative assumptions to get there for both a rebound in our advisory and our transactional business lines, both in REI and advisory. We don't have to get back to 2021 levels in those businesses to get to the direct EPS.  And then within GWS. If you are in the very low double-digit range, we can still get to that record EPS level. And that again, that's all without meaningful capital allocation."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were slightly better than we expected going into the year, but still down significantly from last year's strong first quarter. Our performance relative to our expectations was led by the cyclically resilient elements of our business and our cost management efforts, which more than offset a greater-than-expected decline in property sales.  The elements of our business that are cyclically resilient include our entire GWS business, loan servicing, property management, valuations and asset management fees from our investment management business. Combined, these businesses saw revenue increase nearly 10% during the first quarter and are expected to account for more than 50% of our business segment operating profit for the year, a record high.  With this increased diversification, our business is more resilient, but current conditions are difficult for capital markets and getting more difficult for leasing. There are three major reasons for these difficulties. First, inflation, elevated interest rates and the likelihood of a recession. Second, banking system stress and third, issue specific to the return to office and office utilization. I'll address each of these.  We are aligned with the consensus view that the economy will tip into a recession later this year. We believe it will be a moderate recession and that an eventual easing of the Fed's monetary policy will spur a rebound in economic activity in 2024. The comments Emma and I make today and our responses to questions will be shaped by that view. The high-profile regional bank failures last month have further constrained lending. However, we are not in another global financial crisis when all debt capital source is contracted simultaneously. Regional banks are still lending to commercial real estate but on a much more selective basis. We expect the regional bank pullback to be partly offset by other capital sources, including the GSEs, debt funds and private capital sources.  Looking at the office market, we estimate it will take this asset class twice as long to recover the lost value as it did in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This reflects the formidable challenges facing office assets, driven by both the slow progress employees return to office and the shedding of jobs in tech and other sectors. Ultimately, we believe that office portfolios will shrink meaningfully from where they were prior to the pandemic, making offices a smaller but still very large commercial real estate asset class. Even with these legitimate concerns in line, we believe sentiment has deteriorated more than the fundamentals that underpin our business. This pattern is typical with commercial real estate investors and occupiers, becoming overly bearish in anticipation of and during early stages of a down cycle. It is our view that debt cost and cap rates are likely near their peak and should gradually improve starting later this year, driving a turnaround that will significantly impact 2024 performance.  To expand on my earlier remarks regarding the growing resilience in our business, our Global Workplace Solutions segment, which generated more than $900 million of segment operating profit over the past 12 months, is expected to grow by double digits this year. In total, our cyclically resilient business lines, including GWS, produced approximately $1.5 billion of segment operating profit over the past 12 months and we expect them to grow in aggregate by high single digits this year. It's also important to note that we have become much less dependent on office properties, which accounted for just 14% of U.S. property sales revenue in 2022. Other asset classes where we have large businesses will be more resilient. For instance, we expect valuations for industrial and multifamily to fully recover in two to three years, less than half the time it took coming out of the global financial crisis.  Although we anticipate pressure on our transactional businesses to intensify further this year, we are maintaining our earnings outlook for full year 2023. Emma will discuss this in detail during her remarks. Emma? Steve, it's both of those things. It's the absolute rates, it's the availability of credit, but it's a third thing, and that is the uncertainty about where things are going to go. And we think later this year, all three of those things will start to move in a direction that's helpful to our business. We think rates will stabilize, possibly come down more capital more debt and equity will become available. And the combination of those two things will create more certainty around pricing, and we think that transactions will start to happen again on the capital market side. We talked about that at the end of the year, which, by the way, that was only 60 days ago, roughly. And our long-term view is not altered by what we've seen so far this year. Of course, we'll address that again next year when we have the benefit of the full year view. But our long-term view for the prospects of the business are good.  And of course, part of those -- the long term is the short term, I will say what we've seen in the short term is challenged in one sense, the transactions, but in the other sense, our enthusiasm for and belief in these -- what we're calling these resilient businesses, particularly GWS. And also what we're seeing in the M&A space where we have become a more interesting buyer to a good number of companies than we have been historically. There are companies out there in our sector or directly adjacent to our sector that believe by becoming part of our business or having financial sponsorship from our business will help them perform better than they could perform on their own. And this is not a circumstance that's going on in the same way with other companies in our sector. We think we have a distinct advantage there. And that's going to be a more material part of our future, we believe now that you would have heard from us certainly in the past. Well, there'll be shifts across all of those. So by geography, our business is definitively becoming larger on a relative basis in Asia-Pacific, Asia specifically than it has been historically. I'll give you an example. In the advisory business, forever, our second biggest business was the UK behind the United States, and there wasn't anything close. Our business in Japan now is roughly the same size as our business in the UK.  For sure, we're growing our businesses related to the multifamily and industrial asset classes. We're not the only ones doing that, but that's a definitive part of what we're doing. And then the outsourcing business, which includes us providing facilities management and project management and portfolio services work, mostly for big corporates focused on saving them money, working on their net zero initiatives, shedding assets in some cases. That business will be an enduring double-digit grower and probably not low double digits. We think there's an opportunity to have that be mid-double digits.  And when I made my comments a minute ago about companies being increasingly interested in having us be their acquirer or us investing in them, a lot of that happens in that segment. So that's kind of where we see the shift happening across our businesses. Yeah, retail leasing is good. And by the way, retail rental rates are growing up because there's a big experience thing going on here across the U.S. and around the world that is causing retailers of various types, including food and beverage. But obviously, the high-end retailers doing quite well, and that's helping our leasing business in retail.  Industrial's been white hot over the last couple of years, and it's just not going to stay that hot indefinitely. That's been a little bit anomalistic. And so we are seeing a little bit of downward pressure on industrial leasing. But we think over the longer term, industrial leasing will be very, very strong. And the dynamics driving logistics space around the world will remain in place. But we are seeing some downward pressure on that for sure this year. In aggregate, Jade, I don't think so. And I'll tell you why I say that. First of all, what you're seeing now isn't driven largely by commercial real estate being out of favor. It's not even in the biggest sense being driven by office buildings being out of favor. It's being driven by the denominator effect.  The base of assets around the world is growing. The base of industrial space around the world is growing. The base of institutional quality multifamily around the world is growing, et cetera. And we think that's going to continue. And we think when stock prices rebound, the denominator effect will go in the other direction.  The other thing I would tell you about office space, which has been a big home for capital, there's a tendency when things turn to think that they're going to turn and disappear. Our view is that the portfolios that companies have the office space, not the investors in office space, but the companies that use it that ultimately drive the investment in office space will shrink materially. But it will still be an enormous asset class. If it's down 20% or 10% or 15%, whatever it settles down, it will still be an enormous asset class.  And the future of office space is still being sorted out. We may be more back in the office in the future than we are today. That's just an unknown. But that will be a very large asset class. That will be a very big home for institutional capital in the future, but certainly, other asset classes will and there's all retail and industrial, hotels, multifamily, huge asset classes and look what's going on with hotels.  I mean try to get a hotel room at a rational pre-COVID rate right now anywhere in a good hotel and that you just can't do it. And so I don't think commercial real estate as an asset class is going to decline in importance at all in the future. Jade, there's two areas of our business now where we do meaningful work in infrastructure. We have an investment management business that invests in infrastructure. And with the acquisition of 60% of Turner & Townsend, which by the way, has continued to outperform our expectations. They have a significant infrastructure and significant green energy business, and they do large projects subject to very long-term contracts around the world.  We would expect those businesses to grow and provide incremental opportunity to us in the long run. What we might do beyond that is a long run circumstance that we're not really prepared to talk about at this point, but we do have positive exposure in both those areas. Yeah, Michael. What I said was that we expect the total of our cyclically resilient business is to grow in the high single digits. So that would be GWS valuations, property management the fee portion of our investment management business, we expect our GWS business to grow well into the double digits. Yeah. Well, trophy buildings both in the current environment and in the long term are going to do quite well in our view. Because with all that's going on, on the return to the office circumstance, companies are looking for great environments for their employees. We're doing it for our own headquarters in our own offices around the U.S. and around the world. Virtually, all of our clients are doing it. And these -- so these great buildings are going to do well.  B and C buildings are going to be challenged, and there is less capital available for them. But I think there's an overreaction to that circumstance. The press -- it's like so many things. It's a great story to talk about how bad something is when it gets bad, the fact of the matter is, coming out of the financial crisis, office buildings were capitalized much more conservatively than they had been historically, more equity in office buildings than there had been previously. If you look at the banking system today, something like 1.5% of commercial or commercial banks asset portfolio is in office buildings. It's not a huge threatening circumstance. Some of the problem assets will go back to the bank. Some of them will get restructured and worked out as is always the case with troubled assets. So it's going to be hard to refinance some of those assets and some of those assets are going to become troubled and go back. But it's not going to be an overwhelming circumstance the way certain headlines would suggest it might be. Thank you. Stephen, corporates reducing their office footprint is a headwind for that business. And by the way, has been a headwind for that business for the last 15 years. The average square foot per person that corporates use has been going down and down and down and we've been helping them with that. We've been helping them reconfigure their portfolios. We've been helping them do project work in support of that. And the project work they need now with the kind of space they're trying to deliver for their employees is really important.  So yes, that will be a headwind in terms of the amount of space that we might manage for individual corporates. But other work we would do for them will offset that. But the thing kind of overwhelms that circumstance is that more corporates are bringing us on new clients are bringing us on to help them create environments for their employees to help them save money, both in terms of the size of their footprint, the operation of their facilities to help them move toward a more energy-efficient environment and certainly now with Turner & Townsend, that puts us in a better place to do that.  So the net of all those dynamics is that this is going to be a double-digit growing business. And again, that's before some of the acquisition opportunities that we're seeing that are becoming more prominent for us because -- partly because we want to do it, but partly because companies that might combine with us are finding us more interesting than they used to. Well, I can tell you, Patrick, it won't be surprising to you to hear me say that we interface a lot with the private equity folks in commercial real estate who are customers of ours that might be participants in this. And the view is that this is going to be a big opportunity for them. When there's a lack of supply coming from other areas, people come in and backfill and create opportunities for themselves in that area, and we think that's going to happen here. Interest rates to stabilize and come down are the biggest factor there, and we think that's going to happen later this year. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you again a quarter from now when we report our second quarter results."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Chandni Luthra, EVP, Global Head of FP&A and IR. Thank you. You may begin.\nChandni Luthra: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks and an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Today's presentation contains forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements concerning our business outlook, our business plans and capital allocation strategy, the timing of expected asset sales and our earnings and cash flow outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our SEC filings. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. I'm joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our Chair and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Throughout their remarks, when Bob and Emma cite financial performance relative to expectations, they are referring to actual results against the outlook we provided on our Q2 2024 earnings call in July, unless otherwise noted. Also, as a reminder, our resilient businesses include facilities management, project management, property management, loan servicing, valuation and asset management fee in our investment management business. Our transactional businesses comprise sales, leasing, market origination, carried interest and incentive fee in the investment management business and development fee. Finally, Unless otherwise noted, whenever we site growth rates, we are referring to the percentage change versus the 2023 3rd quarter in U.S. dollars. With that, please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thank you, Chandni, and good morning, everyone. CBRE's performance in the third quarter was marked by strong financial results, operational gains across key parts of our business and continued advancement in our strategic positioning. I'll comment briefly on all 3 areas, starting with our financial performance. We posted our second highest third quarter core earnings on record with core earnings per share up 67%. All 3 business segments posted strong double-digit revenue and segment operating profit growth, along with significant operating leverage. Key drivers included our resilient businesses, where net revenue grew 18% to $3.6 billion, led by Turner & Townsend, as well as leasing, which posted a 19% revenue increase fueled by accelerated office demand. In addition, capital markets transaction activity has passed an inflection point and is in the early stages of recovery. Operationally, GWS' results reflect the cost efficiency efforts we discussed on our first quarter earnings call and put us on course for full year margin expansion. The integration of the CBRE project management business with Turner & Townsend is proceeding with pace and the combined business will start 2025 with considerable momentum. Consolidated free cash flow grew considerably, reflecting our focused efforts to improve cash conversion across our segments. On the strategic front, we have a strong pipeline of attractive investment opportunities both for M&A and our services businesses and co-investments in our REI businesses. Further, our efforts to scale and diversify our business have resulted in a growing total addressable market. We've widened growth avenues in managing data centers and federal government facilities through recent acquisitions in GWS and the Turner & Townsend, CBRE project management combination opens up opportunities in infrastructure, energy and data center projects. Geographically, our Japan and India businesses have grown to the point where they are the second and fifth largest contributors to advisory SOP. Our success and scale have positioned us for continued outsized growth in these huge economies, and we expect them to be disproportionate contributors to CBRE's future growth. For full year 2024, our strong year-to-date performance and momentum entering Q4 have prompted us to raise our outlook for full year core EPS to a range of $4.95 to $5.05, up from $4.70 to $4.90 previously. Now Emma will discuss our third quarter results and outlook in greater detail. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob. I'll start by providing context on how our business has greater earnings growth potential than at any point in our history. We focused on expanding our resilient earnings streams and as a result, our SOP from resilient businesses has increased from approximately 32%, coming out of the global financial crisis to around 60% today. These resilient earnings are significantly less volatile than our transactional businesses. And most importantly, we expect them to achieve enduring double-digit organic growth, which we believe can be boosted even further by M&A. Our investments in resilient businesses have changed the complexion of our company. For context, core EPS fell 30% peak to trough during the downturn we just experienced versus 80% during the GFC. And we are poised to surpass prior peak core earnings next year, less than 2 years from the trough of the downturn. Coming out of the GFC, it took 6 years to return to peak earnings. Now let me walk you through the highlights of each segment's results. I'll start with advisory on Slide 6. Advisory net revenue exceeded expectations, supported by leasing strength in the beginning of a recovery in property sales revenue. We continue to benefit from our strong position in the office leasing market. In fact, global office leasing revenue reached a new high for any Q3, increasing by 26% better than we expected. Greater certainty about the economic outlook is supporting occupier decision-making across primary and secondary markets, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. As expected, demand is skewed towards the highest quality space that will encourage employees to return to the office. Global property sales returned to growth with a 14% revenue increase, exceeding expectations. Revenue grew across all global regions. In the U.S., property sales revenue rose almost 20%, driven by stronger activity in multifamily and retail. This complemented strength across our mortgage origination business, which benefited from a 36% increase in loan origination fees. In addition to continued activity from debt funds, originations picked up notably with the GSEs. Overall, advisory SOP rose almost 50%, and net SOP margin increased by more than 350 basis points. Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the GWS segment. Overall, net revenue for GWS increased 19%, in line with our elevated expectations. Within Facilities Management, net revenue increased 22% with broad-based strength in both the enterprise and local businesses. Through the third quarter, we secured more new enterprise business, including first-generation outsourcing wins and existing contract expansions than in all of 2023. This lays a strong foundation for net revenue growth in 2025. Project Management net revenue rose 12%, led by the Turner & Townsend business. Turner & Townsend exhibited strength across its geographies and asset types with revenue up 18%, once again exceeding expectations. Turner & Townsend's sustained outperformance reinforces our level of conviction in merging CBRE's project management business under Turner & Townsend's leadership. GWS's net SOP margin improved by more than 70 basis points, in line with our expectations, reflecting our cost efficiency initiatives. Please turn to Slide 8, as I discuss the REI results. REI segment operating profit was better than expected and meaningfully above the prior year. This was led by Investment Management, which benefited from incentive fees and significant co-investment returns, reflecting improving market conditions. AUM increased to more than $148 billion during the quarter and $5 billion of capital has been raised this year. At the same time, we have fully cleared our redemption queue in our core funds and are seeing increased interest and fundraising activity across enhanced return strategies. We expect the market backdrop for AUM growth to improve considerably in 2025. As expected, we did not monetize any significant development assets during the quarter. We remain on track to realize large development profits by the end of the year and continue to steadily increase the embedded profit in our development portfolio over the long term. We added $500 million to our in-process and pipeline portfolio in the quarter, which now exceeds $32 billion. Now I'll discuss cash flow and leverage on Slide 9. Free cash flow for the quarter improved meaningfully to $494 million, up more than 60% and trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion improved to 71%. The delta between our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in Q3 was primarily driven by noncash items. Our free cash flow forecast for the full year remains unchanged at slightly over $1 billion. The increase in EPS guidance is not expected to convert to free cash flow primarily because of the large development gains slated for Q4 will be reported in cash flow from investing. Adjusting for this impact, our free cash flow conversion for the year would be within our target range of 75% to 85%. Finally, we are on track to end the year with about 1 turn of net leverage even after deploying $1.3 billion of capital across M&A and co-investments thus far in 2024. Please turn to Slide 10 as I discuss our outlook. Our new core EPS expectations of $4.95 to $5.05 for 2024 represent a 12% increase at the midpoint of the range compared with our original outlook in February. We believe higher full year earnings are achievable because of the outperformance in our businesses thus far this year and our confidence in our business pipeline. We expect to deliver our best fourth quarter core EPS ever, led by GWS, which should exceed its prior SOP record by a significant margin. It is notable that we expect to achieve this level of earnings in the fourth quarter without Advisory or REI returning to prior peak profits. All segments are expected to materially exceed their prior earnings peaks in coming years. Within Advisory, we now expect over 20% SOP growth for the full year, mostly driven by stronger-than-expected leasing activity. GWS is in line with our prior expectations, we are narrowing guidance and expect to grow SOP in the high teens range for the full year. And for REI, we continue to expect multiple development asset sales to be completed in the fourth quarter. Looking to 2025, the midpoint of our new 2024 guidance implies that we are only about 12% from our prior peak earnings. Absent an unanticipated market event, we will almost certainly exceed prior core EPS of $5.69 next year, fueled by continued double-digit growth in our resilient businesses and a further recovery in our transactional businesses. Now I'll turn the call back to Bob for closing thoughts.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Emma. Given the market's strong focus on anticipated improvement in the real estate capital markets, I'll put this in perspective as it relates to CBRE's earnings prospects. While there are secondary impacts across our business, the capital markets directly affect our performance in property sales, loan originations, Real Estate Development and Investment Management. Since these businesses are interest rate sensitive, the Fed's start of a new monetary easing cycle has recently heightened investor enthusiasm for the real estate services sector. We share the market's enthusiasm and expect to benefit from a capital markets recovery over the next several years. But it's important to stress that CBRE's strong, short and long-term growth prospects are excellent regardless of the real estate capital markets impacts. This owes to the progress we've made in building our resilient businesses, our leadership in the global leasing markets and the large and growing total addressable market for our business that I commented on earlier. Our resilient businesses are expected to generate about $1.8 billion of SOP this year, reflecting double-digit growth. We expect these businesses to continue this pace of growth for the foreseeable future. In addition, leasing, our largest line of business by profits is close to surpassing prior peak revenue and earnings this year with considerable room for further growth. As a result, we don't need a capital markets recovery to surpass prior peak earnings in 2025 or to sustain strong growth beyond next year. Real estate capital markets are important to our business, but their lower relative contribution to our performance underscores the extent to which we have evolved and diversified CBRE's business and underpins our confidence in a strong long-term outlook. With that, operator, we'll take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Bob, I want to go back to your comments about kind of the capital markets activity passing an inflection point. As we kind of look into 2025, do you have a sense of how steep the acceleration of this recovery is going to be? Will we be sitting here a couple of quarters from now in lapping comps up 30% or 40% year-over-year? Curious just kind of what you're seeing from an acceleration perspective?\nBob Sulentic : Our current expectation is not that it's going to be a steep capital markets recovery. We think it will be a steady recovery, we think buyers and sellers have largely come together for most asset classes or very close to having come together, not for office, I think, obviously. There is debt available now. There is some positive leverage available now. There's increased interest in multifamily. We've actually seen a little bit of cap rate compression in multifamily and industrial, not much. So we think there'll be a steady improvement next year, but we don't think it's going to be a precipitous improvement. Our plan doesn't anticipate a precipitous improvement. And the anecdotal evidence that we're gathering would suggest that it's going to be more of a steady improvement.\nMichael Griffin: That's helpful. And then just going back to your comments around kind of the double-digit expected growth over the near to medium term in those resilient business lines. Can we get a sense -- was this really organic driven? Are you assuming some level of external growth and kind of that expected growth number? I'm just curious, I mean it seems that the stickiness of this -- the nature of these businesses, it seems like you do have pricing power for a lot of this stuff. Just if you could maybe comment on kind of where that growth is coming from?\nBob Sulentic : I'll comment and then I'll ask Emma to also comment. But you mentioned near and medium term, but it's near, medium and long term that we're expecting double-digit growth in these businesses, and it's organic getting us into low double-digit range that will be supplemented by investment -- M&A investment we feel very good about that. As I mentioned in our call today, which we haven't talked a lot about before, but we started to focus on it. Our total addressable market is growing. It was already a huge addressable market, total addressable market for outsourcing that had been only partially tapped. But with Turner & Townsend, with the acquisitions we've done, the total addressable market now for organic growth from where we sit is very strong. We've got these 2 businesses in India and Japan that have become quite prominent for us. an awful lot that we've barely gotten started with in those 2 markets. We've got great leadership teams there. We expect them to be able to grow significantly on a double-digit basis for years to come. But we do have a lot of capital. We do have an M&A strategy, and we think we can supplement that through M&A. So I'm going to let Emma talk about that a little bit.\nEmma Giamartino : And so I would add on our resilience SOP, I think we\u2019ve talked about it before, but this is a big earnings stream for us. And for the year, we expect it to deliver $1.8 billion of SOP. So that\u2019s grown at a double-digit rate over the past number of years, and we expect that to continue. That has been both organic and M&A, but to Bob\u2019s point that organic growth has been in the low double-digit range, and we expect that to continue. I think what is not always appreciated is that we\u2019ll end this year at about 60% of our SOP from resilient lines of business. And because of the growth in these businesses, even through a transaction recovery, we expect to remain around that 60% range over time. And then in terms of M&A, we are continuing to look at opportunities to expand mainly in the technical services space within Facilities Management, but also elsewhere, I look at deals like J&J that we did earlier this year, which expanded into the federal government space, and we believe that\u2019s a $20 billion market. And then direct line in the data center space, which we believe is a $30 billion market. So we expect to \u2013 we\u2019re looking at more of the same. But of course, as we always say, M&A takes a long time. We want to do deals that are right for us with really strong operating leaders in areas where we think we can deliver a really strong return.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan Chase.\nAnthony Paolone: My first question relates to leasing. I mean, how should we think about the potential to grow office leasing from here because you mentioned it being like, I think it was the best third quarter in the company's history. And so I'm just trying to understand if there was some clearing of the backlog or pulling forward of demand there, to kind of see like where it goes from here and what normalized might be?\nBob Sulentic : So, Tony, we don't pretend to have a great view as to exactly where office leasing is going to go. It's been a little bit of an unknown for all of us since we came through COVID, here's what we do believe. There's a lot of news around prime space being leased up in a number of markets at the highest rates ever. And because of our participation in those markets, we've done well. However, we don't believe that this leasing success we've seen recently is driven by prime space. We believe it's being driven by occupiers who want space and are targeting prime space first. And when that prime space is leased up, they will move on to the next best thing, which will give landlords owners of office buildings, the incentive to invest in B and B+ buildings to move them toward A. So we think we're going to see some sustained strength in office leasing. We think we're going to see a continued slow return to the office. We do not believe we're going to go back to pre-COVID levels. But I'll say what I've said on the last 2 or 3 calls, we spend a lot of time with occupier customers. We've got a big conference. We've got 900 people in Dallas this week with our GWS Enterprise business. And everybody is talking about office space as being important to their future. So we expect there to be a sustainable move toward office space that is creating good experiences to get people back in the office. And we think the leasing success we've seen is going to continue into next year and beyond.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. My second question is, if we look back earlier in the year, you guys had some cost pressures that emerged and you took some actions, it seems like, and we saw the margin expansion in the quarter. How should we think about whether you -- whether that's all dialed in at this point? Or how should we think about margin expansion as we look into next year? Is there still room for that? Or any thoughts there?\nEmma Giamartino : So the majority of those cost actions were done across Q2 and Q3. So what you're seeing this year is not the full run rate impact. So of course, you'll see a continued impact to our margins -- really strong benefit to our margins in GWS in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we're expecting our GWS margins to improve over last year. And then that should continue into next year. Again, this is a business that you're not going to see a step change in our margins, but we should see a continued improvement through next year.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Bob, I can understand why you don't want to forecast a sharp recovery in the Transaction business. It's certainly not in your best interest to predict that. But to the extent that one occurred, I guess what I'm just trying to figure out is, is it really predicated on just kind of the Fed easing cycle sort of unfolding as they've kind of laid out, is it really having the long end of the bond yield curve kind of coming back down? Is it more stability in the bond yield? Like what would get a sharp recovery in your mind versus a more modest recovery?\nBob Sulentic : Steve, I think all of that contributes to it. But I believe, and I commented on this last quarter, what would create a sharp recovery is more stability in interest rates, maybe them coming down a little bit, but some thought leaders among the investor community stepping into the market, doing some transactions and causing others to believe they had to get in and move quickly because in the absence of doing that, they would end up being buyers downstream at higher prices. And we have seen a little bit of compression for cap rates for the best multifamily and industrial assets already. So I don't think it's totally about interest rates coming down or interest rate stability. I think it's also partially about buyer-seller psychology, which it always is in cycles, of course.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Maybe, Emma, just on sort of the share buybacks, as we think about kind of you guys using free cash flow next year, assuming it's kind of at least $1 billion again. How should we just think about the benefits, acquisitions versus buybacks? And given that the stock is at a much higher price and a higher valuation today, does that sort of temper your enthusiasm for share buybacks? And if you don't do that, kind of where does the free cash flow go?\nEmma Giamartino : So I\u2019ll start by saying it does not temper our interest and share buybacks. We are continuing M&A balancing that with buybacks when it makes sense. I will say, as we look at where our share rate is today, valuation of today, it remains at this place, we will definitely consider more buybacks than we\u2019ve done in the past. We believe that we\u2019re trading at a significant discount to our intrinsic value.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.\nStephen Sheldon: First, I wanted to ask about incremental margins in capital markets, as we are at the early stages of recovery. And specifically, will you need to do much rehiring within capital markets, especially in terms of supporting head count to be able to capitalize on higher volumes? What are you seeing there?\nBob Sulentic : We've got considerable capacity in our mortgage origination team. Although we're adding talent to that team, we've got a great leader in that area of our business who's doing a great job of recruiting. And we've got capacity in our investment sales team. So we don't need to add talent to grow those businesses materially. But it is important, and maybe I should make a clarifying comment. We talk so much about the growth of our resilient businesses because that's an important part of our strategy. But we are doing nothing to restrain the growth of our transactional businesses. We're the market leader in capital markets and leasing, and we're investing in growing those businesses. So you should expect to see us add talent to both the leasing side of the business and the capital markets side of the business, but we don't need to do that to grow significantly from where we are now.\nStephen Sheldon: Understood. That's helpful. And I wanted to maybe -- second, I wanted to drill down into the margin in the GWS segment, great trends there this quarter. I think you talked about there's maybe still some flow-through impact that we should think about some of the actions you took in prior quarters. But just as we think about the next 2, 3, 4 years, what levers do you have to keep pushing margins higher there over time?\nEmma Giamartino : So there\u2019s a number of levers. This piece is really resetting. This first stage is really resetting, our cost base, mainly \u2013 primarily focused on our operating expenses overall across the business. The second piece that we\u2019re extremely focused on, and we\u2019ve seen some progress in is focusing on contracts, and these are very large contracts, especially in our Enterprise business at incrementally higher margins. So we should \u2013 you should continue to see a benefit from that over time, as we do M&A in these highly technical services, all those businesses operate at a higher margin than our traditional business. So that will continue to improve margins over time. And then there\u2019s other things that we can do within our contracts, even our existing contracts to improve that margin. So it will be a steady increase over time, but know that we\u2019re very focused on delivering that steady increase over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: A quick one for me. Just going back to the GWS business, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the pipeline, breakout between sort of first generation versus existing contract. I guess I'm wondering, are enterprises just overall engaging more? Or are you guys sustaining share?\nEmma Giamartino : We are seeing an increase in first-generation outsourcing contracts. We've talked about it over the last number of quarters and even years. Those contracts typically take or those clients typically take, as you'd expect, longer to convert, sometimes they can take over a year. But we're seeing significant progress there. We're also seeing significant progress in expansions and new wins within our existing client base. Anything that you want to add to that, Bob?\nBob Sulentic : No. I think we're seeing -- as we've always said in that business, we get a lot of growth out of expansions because we get in the door with these enormous occupiers that have -- I'll give you an example. I was having lunch with one of our clients the other day, who runs real estate for a prominent U.S. manufacturer. They have 2,100 leases and facilities around the world. And we do a lot for them that there's a huge amount we don't do for them. And he was telling me how happy they are with what we do in various areas and how they want to expand the relationship. And if you're sitting in the seat, he's sitting in, the demands on you to make that portfolio of properties perform cost effectively to create great experiences on the manufacturing side, where we're able to do more and more to be more efficient from inside the yellow lines perspective. All of that creates opportunity for us. And all of that would come in the expansion area. And then there continues to be a good number of corporations, hospitals, universities, others who -- government entities who are considering outsourcing and haven't done it yet.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. My second question was just going to be, you guys are leaders in multiple different business lines, and you sort of talked about the ability for sort of clients to engage in those business lines. I guess I'm just wondering from sort of the last 2 quarters where you've seen sort of acceleration in capital markets. Are you seeing that thesis sort of through that?\nBob Sulentic : Yes. Unfortunately, you're almost totally cutting out, and we didn't hear the question.\nRonald Kamdem: Sorry about that. Clients being able to engage in multiple business lines, are you seeing that playing out as capital markets are recovering and any sort of anecdotes you could share?\nBob Sulentic : Well, we are seeing that play out especially on the occupier. But on the capital markets side, we -- on the occupier side, we see it more. But on the capital markets side, we do, do a lot of work for those clients. We do valuations work. We do property management work. Obviously, we do building sales work. We do debt financing work for them. So there is a lot we do for the investor clients. They're in the capital markets side of the business as well. Those solutions don't tend to be as integrated as the occupier solutions are, but there's plenty we do, and we have some enormous clients on that side that we interface with on an account basis as opposed to a one-by-one transactional basis.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.\nJade Rahmani: Quite different to be talking about upside at this point in the cycle. I wanted to ask about Trammell Crow. First question would be, if you've identified significant parcels of land entitled currently for industrial, that could be repurposed for our data center use and our devising strategies either through sales or joint venture to monetize such investments.\nBob Sulentic : Yes. Jade, it is a fact that the path to data center land does fairly regularly run through logistics land sites that happen to have adequate power. And because we have a big position in logistics land sites, that's one of the core competencies of Trammell Crow Company to identify and acquire logistics land sites. We are seeing some opportunity there that we're quite confident will result in strong financial returns for us. And we, not surprisingly, given that have a proactive effort underway to identify more of that land. We alluded to it a little bit over the last few quarters. This amount of pent-up profits in our in-process portfolio, the fact that we've put incremental balance sheet capital into the development business when others were on the sideline. That's a significant strategic initiative for us that's probably more prominent than appears on the surface.\nJade Rahmani: And to take the question one step further, relates to some of your initial comments around M&A and infrastructure. Would you contemplate combining aspects of Trammell Crow or REI with something in the infrastructure management or data center space? Across real estate coverage conglomerate type businesses tend to have a discount associated with the development arm because investors struggle to find predictability to earnings. Perhaps that relates to Emma's comments that CBRE might be trading at an intrinsic value discount. But one way to unlock this could be through a strategic transaction in the alternative asset manager space as real estate asset managers tend to trade at very high multiples. Just curious as to your thoughts about potentially spinning off Trammell Crow or combining with something and really building out this data center capability.\nBob Sulentic : Well, there\u2019s some good insights in that question, Jade. I want to start by saying we are not contemplating trading off Trammell Crow Company because it does so \u2013 not only is it a really good, really well-run business that generates high returns and creates opportunities for them to invest our capital. But it does interface really productively with other parts of our business, and I\u2019m going to give you an example. During the middle of the COVID stay-at-home era. We started a fund called USLP. It\u2019s a fund that exists in our Investment Management business. We\u2019ve told part of this story before, but it was seeded by a portfolio of Trammell Crow Company industrial development projects, plus also using our own balance sheet to secure a couple of portfolios. And anybody that watches the investment management business knows how hard it is to scale a core-plus fund early on. We started that fund in COVID, put the whole thing together by Zoom. None of the meetings, none of the interface was done in person. Started during COVID. From a standing start, that fund today is $5 billion. That fund would not exist in all probability without Trammell Crow Company. And Trammell Crow Company gives us opportunities to do that in other areas. We\u2019ve got all kinds of things we\u2019re looking at with Trammell Crow Company and our Investment Management business together. Another example, and we\u2019ve alluded to this too, there \u2013 we got $2 billion-plus manufacturing plants that we\u2019re handling the land acquisition, land development and project management on in a venture between Turner & Townsend and Trammell Crow Company. If you talk to Denselancy at Turner & Townsend, or Danny Queen and the Trammell Crow Company, they would tell you neither one of them would have done those deals alone. We think that positions them well to do more of that. That\u2019s the kind of thing that gives us confidence about where this business is going to go. So not only is on a kind of freestanding basis is Trammell Crow Company, a really good business for us to have. It does a lot with our other businesses. The other thing I\u2019ll say is it generates a lot of cash with immediate cash conversion that we can use to invest all over CBRE. So a lot that can be done with that business.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies.\nPeter Abramowitz: And congrats on a very strong quarter. Just wanted to dig into the leasing a little bit. You called out office globally, it was up 26%, which is very impressive. Just curious if we could go sort of broad-based. What are you seeing on the industrial side? How did that compare to the up 26% in office? And any sort of general comments on how things are trending for industrial leasing?\nBob Sulentic : Industrial leasing is trending up, not at the rate that office leasing is. And one of the reasons for that is there's some huge, huge users of industrial space that everybody is aware of. And they took down a lot of space over the last few years, and there -- and they've got vacancy in their portfolios that they're burning through. We think that, that's going to kind of come through the pipeline over the next year or 2 years and that demand will then pick back up on the leasing side after that. But we do expect leasing for Industrial to be better next year, although not dramatically better than it was this year.\nPeter Abramowitz: All right. That's helpful. And then maybe to go back to -- I think it was Steve's question, just about rate sensitivity in the capital markets recovery. I guess the Fed has put out this playbook, but the longer than the curve has kind of remained stubbornly high here. So just curious to hear your thoughts on if that continues to be the case, how that would impact sort of your thinking around the magnitude of the capital markets recovery?\nEmma Giamartino : And Peter, we\u2019re really focused on the next few months, what we\u2019re seeing through the end of the year. In the guidance that we gave, with the midpoint of $5 of EPS, that embeds a high level of confidence in what we believe is going to happen in the capital markets. So our \u2013 we\u2019re expecting our investment sales revenue to grow in Q4 by 30%. So that\u2019s not a low number. I realize it\u2019s off a low base. But \u2013 and we have high visibility into that number. I know there\u2019s been lots of questions around rates have gone \u2013 the tenure has gone above 4 recently. We don\u2019t expect that to have a huge impact over the next couple of months. We\u2019ve had a record number of rate locks through August and September, and we\u2019re seeing the \u2013 the sales activity come off of that. So there shouldn\u2019t be a lot of volatility through the end of the year in our sales activity.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan Chase.\nAnthony Paolone: I just have one follow-up. I understand the data center team and the attractiveness there. I was wondering if you could spend a minute on just kind of where you see CBRE's biggest revenue opportunity in that ecosystem? Like what do you see yourselves really doing most there? And how do you make money at it?\nBob Sulentic : We\u2019ve got a bunch of exposure to data centers, Tony. We already talked about the land plays that Trammell Crow Company is making that give us opportunities to profit there. Turner & Townsend has in excess of 110 hyperscale data centers that they\u2019re project managing. We have a data center services business where we manage data centers on behalf of occupiers, we manage between 700 and 800 data centers in that business. We just did the direct line acquisition that has \u2013 the early returns on that are really encouraging, and we synergize that with that Data Center Services business. And that does small projects inside the inside the white lines and data centers. So that\u2019s very strong. We have a data center sales business in our Advisory business that\u2019s very, very capable. And with all those things going on in data centers where we have prominent positions, we are doing a decent amount of strategy work as to how we could extract more from that and where we can go from here. We\u2019re not ready to describe any specific strategic initiatives yet, but we\u2019ve got a lot of exposure, a lot of expertise, and we\u2019re exploring opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Just one quick follow-up. Emma, just on the loan servicing business. I realize it's not terribly large, but it was basically flattish in the quarter. I know you sort of referenced it here in the press release, but just anything that kind of pushed that down that was abnormal this quarter?\nEmma Giamartino : Yes. The underlying growth is 5%. I think what you see is basically 1% growth, but the actual growth is 5%. We\u2019ve moved from some escrow income had to be moved from loan servicing to the commercial mortgage origination line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW.\nJade Rahmani: With the 60% contribution from resilient businesses, which is expected to remain near that level, what are your thoughts around instituting a regular quarterly dividend?\nEmma Giamartino : Jade, it\u2019s something that we evaluate over time. Right now, we think that we love the flexibility of buybacks, and we\u2019ve been able to execute on our buybacks over the past number of years. So as long as we expect to continue to do that, we don\u2019t think that a dividend is necessary, but it\u2019s something that we evaluate.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Bob Sulentic for closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report our year-end results.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. I'll start by providing context on how our business has greater earnings growth potential than at any point in our history. We focused on expanding our resilient earnings streams and as a result, our SOP from resilient businesses has increased from approximately 32%, coming out of the global financial crisis to around 60% today. These resilient earnings are significantly less volatile than our transactional businesses. And most importantly, we expect them to achieve enduring double-digit organic growth, which we believe can be boosted even further by M&A. Our investments in resilient businesses have changed the complexion of our company. For context, core EPS fell 30% peak to trough during the downturn we just experienced versus 80% during the GFC. And we are poised to surpass prior peak core earnings next year, less than 2 years from the trough of the downturn. Coming out of the GFC, it took 6 years to return to peak earnings. Now let me walk you through the highlights of each segment's results. I'll start with advisory on Slide 6. Advisory net revenue exceeded expectations, supported by leasing strength in the beginning of a recovery in property sales revenue. We continue to benefit from our strong position in the office leasing market. In fact, global office leasing revenue reached a new high for any Q3, increasing by 26% better than we expected. Greater certainty about the economic outlook is supporting occupier decision-making across primary and secondary markets, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. As expected, demand is skewed towards the highest quality space that will encourage employees to return to the office. Global property sales returned to growth with a 14% revenue increase, exceeding expectations. Revenue grew across all global regions. In the U.S., property sales revenue rose almost 20%, driven by stronger activity in multifamily and retail. This complemented strength across our mortgage origination business, which benefited from a 36% increase in loan origination fees. In addition to continued activity from debt funds, originations picked up notably with the GSEs. Overall, advisory SOP rose almost 50%, and net SOP margin increased by more than 350 basis points. Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of the GWS segment. Overall, net revenue for GWS increased 19%, in line with our elevated expectations. Within Facilities Management, net revenue increased 22% with broad-based strength in both the enterprise and local businesses. Through the third quarter, we secured more new enterprise business, including first-generation outsourcing wins and existing contract expansions than in all of 2023. This lays a strong foundation for net revenue growth in 2025. Project Management net revenue rose 12%, led by the Turner & Townsend business. Turner & Townsend exhibited strength across its geographies and asset types with revenue up 18%, once again exceeding expectations. Turner & Townsend's sustained outperformance reinforces our level of conviction in merging CBRE's project management business under Turner & Townsend's leadership. GWS's net SOP margin improved by more than 70 basis points, in line with our expectations, reflecting our cost efficiency initiatives. Please turn to Slide 8, as I discuss the REI results. REI segment operating profit was better than expected and meaningfully above the prior year. This was led by Investment Management, which benefited from incentive fees and significant co-investment returns, reflecting improving market conditions. AUM increased to more than $148 billion during the quarter and $5 billion of capital has been raised this year. At the same time, we have fully cleared our redemption queue in our core funds and are seeing increased interest and fundraising activity across enhanced return strategies. We expect the market backdrop for AUM growth to improve considerably in 2025. As expected, we did not monetize any significant development assets during the quarter. We remain on track to realize large development profits by the end of the year and continue to steadily increase the embedded profit in our development portfolio over the long term. We added $500 million to our in-process and pipeline portfolio in the quarter, which now exceeds $32 billion. Now I'll discuss cash flow and leverage on Slide 9. Free cash flow for the quarter improved meaningfully to $494 million, up more than 60% and trailing 12-month free cash flow conversion improved to 71%. The delta between our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in Q3 was primarily driven by noncash items. Our free cash flow forecast for the full year remains unchanged at slightly over $1 billion. The increase in EPS guidance is not expected to convert to free cash flow primarily because of the large development gains slated for Q4 will be reported in cash flow from investing. Adjusting for this impact, our free cash flow conversion for the year would be within our target range of 75% to 85%. Finally, we are on track to end the year with about 1 turn of net leverage even after deploying $1.3 billion of capital across M&A and co-investments thus far in 2024. Please turn to Slide 10 as I discuss our outlook. Our new core EPS expectations of $4.95 to $5.05 for 2024 represent a 12% increase at the midpoint of the range compared with our original outlook in February. We believe higher full year earnings are achievable because of the outperformance in our businesses thus far this year and our confidence in our business pipeline. We expect to deliver our best fourth quarter core EPS ever, led by GWS, which should exceed its prior SOP record by a significant margin. It is notable that we expect to achieve this level of earnings in the fourth quarter without Advisory or REI returning to prior peak profits. All segments are expected to materially exceed their prior earnings peaks in coming years. Within Advisory, we now expect over 20% SOP growth for the full year, mostly driven by stronger-than-expected leasing activity. GWS is in line with our prior expectations, we are narrowing guidance and expect to grow SOP in the high teens range for the full year. And for REI, we continue to expect multiple development asset sales to be completed in the fourth quarter. Looking to 2025, the midpoint of our new 2024 guidance implies that we are only about 12% from our prior peak earnings. Absent an unanticipated market event, we will almost certainly exceed prior core EPS of $5.69 next year, fueled by continued double-digit growth in our resilient businesses and a further recovery in our transactional businesses. Now I'll turn the call back to Bob for closing thoughts. And so I would add on our resilience SOP, I think we've talked about it before, but this is a big earnings stream for us. And for the year, we expect it to deliver $1.8 billion of SOP. So that's grown at a double-digit rate over the past number of years, and we expect that to continue. That has been both organic and M&A, but to Bob's point that organic growth has been in the low double-digit range, and we expect that to continue. I think what is not always appreciated is that we'll end this year at about 60% of our SOP from resilient lines of business. And because of the growth in these businesses, even through a transaction recovery, we expect to remain around that 60% range over time. And then in terms of M&A, we are continuing to look at opportunities to expand mainly in the technical services space within Facilities Management, but also elsewhere, I look at deals like J&J that we did earlier this year, which expanded into the federal government space, and we believe that's a $20 billion market. And then direct line in the data center space, which we believe is a $30 billion market. So we expect to \u2013 we're looking at more of the same. But of course, as we always say, M&A takes a long time. We want to do deals that are right for us with really strong operating leaders in areas where we think we can deliver a really strong return. So the majority of those cost actions were done across Q2 and Q3. So what you're seeing this year is not the full run rate impact. So of course, you'll see a continued impact to our margins -- really strong benefit to our margins in GWS in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we're expecting our GWS margins to improve over last year. And then that should continue into next year. Again, this is a business that you're not going to see a step change in our margins, but we should see a continued improvement through next year. So I'll start by saying it does not temper our interest and share buybacks. We are continuing M&A balancing that with buybacks when it makes sense. I will say, as we look at where our share rate is today, valuation of today, it remains at this place, we will definitely consider more buybacks than we've done in the past. We believe that we're trading at a significant discount to our intrinsic value. So there's a number of levers. This piece is really resetting. This first stage is really resetting, our cost base, mainly \u2013 primarily focused on our operating expenses overall across the business. The second piece that we're extremely focused on, and we've seen some progress in is focusing on contracts, and these are very large contracts, especially in our Enterprise business at incrementally higher margins. So we should \u2013 you should continue to see a benefit from that over time, as we do M&A in these highly technical services, all those businesses operate at a higher margin than our traditional business. So that will continue to improve margins over time. And then there's other things that we can do within our contracts, even our existing contracts to improve that margin. So it will be a steady increase over time, but know that we're very focused on delivering that steady increase over the next few years. We are seeing an increase in first-generation outsourcing contracts. We've talked about it over the last number of quarters and even years. Those contracts typically take or those clients typically take, as you'd expect, longer to convert, sometimes they can take over a year. But we're seeing significant progress there. We're also seeing significant progress in expansions and new wins within our existing client base. Anything that you want to add to that, Bob? And Peter, we're really focused on the next few months, what we're seeing through the end of the year. In the guidance that we gave, with the midpoint of $5 of EPS, that embeds a high level of confidence in what we believe is going to happen in the capital markets. So our \u2013 we're expecting our investment sales revenue to grow in Q4 by 30%. So that's not a low number. I realize it's off a low base. But \u2013 and we have high visibility into that number. I know there's been lots of questions around rates have gone \u2013 the tenure has gone above 4 recently. We don't expect that to have a huge impact over the next couple of months. We've had a record number of rate locks through August and September, and we're seeing the \u2013 the sales activity come off of that. So there shouldn't be a lot of volatility through the end of the year in our sales activity. Yes. The underlying growth is 5%. I think what you see is basically 1% growth, but the actual growth is 5%. We've moved from some escrow income had to be moved from loan servicing to the commercial mortgage origination line. Jade, it's something that we evaluate over time. Right now, we think that we love the flexibility of buybacks, and we've been able to execute on our buybacks over the past number of years. So as long as we expect to continue to do that, we don't think that a dividend is necessary, but it's something that we evaluate."

            "name": "Bob Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Chandni, and good morning, everyone. CBRE's performance in the third quarter was marked by strong financial results, operational gains across key parts of our business and continued advancement in our strategic positioning. I'll comment briefly on all 3 areas, starting with our financial performance. We posted our second highest third quarter core earnings on record with core earnings per share up 67%. All 3 business segments posted strong double-digit revenue and segment operating profit growth, along with significant operating leverage. Key drivers included our resilient businesses, where net revenue grew 18% to $3.6 billion, led by Turner & Townsend, as well as leasing, which posted a 19% revenue increase fueled by accelerated office demand. In addition, capital markets transaction activity has passed an inflection point and is in the early stages of recovery. Operationally, GWS' results reflect the cost efficiency efforts we discussed on our first quarter earnings call and put us on course for full year margin expansion. The integration of the CBRE project management business with Turner & Townsend is proceeding with pace and the combined business will start 2025 with considerable momentum. Consolidated free cash flow grew considerably, reflecting our focused efforts to improve cash conversion across our segments. On the strategic front, we have a strong pipeline of attractive investment opportunities both for M&A and our services businesses and co-investments in our REI businesses. Further, our efforts to scale and diversify our business have resulted in a growing total addressable market. We've widened growth avenues in managing data centers and federal government facilities through recent acquisitions in GWS and the Turner & Townsend, CBRE project management combination opens up opportunities in infrastructure, energy and data center projects. Geographically, our Japan and India businesses have grown to the point where they are the second and fifth largest contributors to advisory SOP. Our success and scale have positioned us for continued outsized growth in these huge economies, and we expect them to be disproportionate contributors to CBRE's future growth. For full year 2024, our strong year-to-date performance and momentum entering Q4 have prompted us to raise our outlook for full year core EPS to a range of $4.95 to $5.05, up from $4.70 to $4.90 previously. Now Emma will discuss our third quarter results and outlook in greater detail. Emma? Thanks, Emma. Given the market's strong focus on anticipated improvement in the real estate capital markets, I'll put this in perspective as it relates to CBRE's earnings prospects. While there are secondary impacts across our business, the capital markets directly affect our performance in property sales, loan originations, Real Estate Development and Investment Management. Since these businesses are interest rate sensitive, the Fed's start of a new monetary easing cycle has recently heightened investor enthusiasm for the real estate services sector. We share the market's enthusiasm and expect to benefit from a capital markets recovery over the next several years. But it's important to stress that CBRE's strong, short and long-term growth prospects are excellent regardless of the real estate capital markets impacts. This owes to the progress we've made in building our resilient businesses, our leadership in the global leasing markets and the large and growing total addressable market for our business that I commented on earlier. Our resilient businesses are expected to generate about $1.8 billion of SOP this year, reflecting double-digit growth. We expect these businesses to continue this pace of growth for the foreseeable future. In addition, leasing, our largest line of business by profits is close to surpassing prior peak revenue and earnings this year with considerable room for further growth. As a result, we don't need a capital markets recovery to surpass prior peak earnings in 2025 or to sustain strong growth beyond next year. Real estate capital markets are important to our business, but their lower relative contribution to our performance underscores the extent to which we have evolved and diversified CBRE's business and underpins our confidence in a strong long-term outlook. With that, operator, we'll take questions. Our current expectation is not that it's going to be a steep capital markets recovery. We think it will be a steady recovery, we think buyers and sellers have largely come together for most asset classes or very close to having come together, not for office, I think, obviously. There is debt available now. There is some positive leverage available now. There's increased interest in multifamily. We've actually seen a little bit of cap rate compression in multifamily and industrial, not much. So we think there'll be a steady improvement next year, but we don't think it's going to be a precipitous improvement. Our plan doesn't anticipate a precipitous improvement. And the anecdotal evidence that we're gathering would suggest that it's going to be more of a steady improvement. I'll comment and then I'll ask Emma to also comment. But you mentioned near and medium term, but it's near, medium and long term that we're expecting double-digit growth in these businesses, and it's organic getting us into low double-digit range that will be supplemented by investment -- M&A investment we feel very good about that. As I mentioned in our call today, which we haven't talked a lot about before, but we started to focus on it. Our total addressable market is growing. It was already a huge addressable market, total addressable market for outsourcing that had been only partially tapped. But with Turner & Townsend, with the acquisitions we've done, the total addressable market now for organic growth from where we sit is very strong. We've got these 2 businesses in India and Japan that have become quite prominent for us. an awful lot that we've barely gotten started with in those 2 markets. We've got great leadership teams there. We expect them to be able to grow significantly on a double-digit basis for years to come. But we do have a lot of capital. We do have an M&A strategy, and we think we can supplement that through M&A. So I'm going to let Emma talk about that a little bit. So, Tony, we don't pretend to have a great view as to exactly where office leasing is going to go. It's been a little bit of an unknown for all of us since we came through COVID, here's what we do believe. There's a lot of news around prime space being leased up in a number of markets at the highest rates ever. And because of our participation in those markets, we've done well. However, we don't believe that this leasing success we've seen recently is driven by prime space. We believe it's being driven by occupiers who want space and are targeting prime space first. And when that prime space is leased up, they will move on to the next best thing, which will give landlords owners of office buildings, the incentive to invest in B and B+ buildings to move them toward A. So we think we're going to see some sustained strength in office leasing. We think we're going to see a continued slow return to the office. We do not believe we're going to go back to pre-COVID levels. But I'll say what I've said on the last 2 or 3 calls, we spend a lot of time with occupier customers. We've got a big conference. We've got 900 people in Dallas this week with our GWS Enterprise business. And everybody is talking about office space as being important to their future. So we expect there to be a sustainable move toward office space that is creating good experiences to get people back in the office. And we think the leasing success we've seen is going to continue into next year and beyond. Steve, I think all of that contributes to it. But I believe, and I commented on this last quarter, what would create a sharp recovery is more stability in interest rates, maybe them coming down a little bit, but some thought leaders among the investor community stepping into the market, doing some transactions and causing others to believe they had to get in and move quickly because in the absence of doing that, they would end up being buyers downstream at higher prices. And we have seen a little bit of compression for cap rates for the best multifamily and industrial assets already. So I don't think it's totally about interest rates coming down or interest rate stability. I think it's also partially about buyer-seller psychology, which it always is in cycles, of course. We've got considerable capacity in our mortgage origination team. Although we're adding talent to that team, we've got a great leader in that area of our business who's doing a great job of recruiting. And we've got capacity in our investment sales team. So we don't need to add talent to grow those businesses materially. But it is important, and maybe I should make a clarifying comment. We talk so much about the growth of our resilient businesses because that's an important part of our strategy. But we are doing nothing to restrain the growth of our transactional businesses. We're the market leader in capital markets and leasing, and we're investing in growing those businesses. So you should expect to see us add talent to both the leasing side of the business and the capital markets side of the business, but we don't need to do that to grow significantly from where we are now. No. I think we're seeing -- as we've always said in that business, we get a lot of growth out of expansions because we get in the door with these enormous occupiers that have -- I'll give you an example. I was having lunch with one of our clients the other day, who runs real estate for a prominent U.S. manufacturer. They have 2,100 leases and facilities around the world. And we do a lot for them that there's a huge amount we don't do for them. And he was telling me how happy they are with what we do in various areas and how they want to expand the relationship. And if you're sitting in the seat, he's sitting in, the demands on you to make that portfolio of properties perform cost effectively to create great experiences on the manufacturing side, where we're able to do more and more to be more efficient from inside the yellow lines perspective. All of that creates opportunity for us. And all of that would come in the expansion area. And then there continues to be a good number of corporations, hospitals, universities, others who -- government entities who are considering outsourcing and haven't done it yet. Yes. Unfortunately, you're almost totally cutting out, and we didn't hear the question. Well, we are seeing that play out especially on the occupier. But on the capital markets side, we -- on the occupier side, we see it more. But on the capital markets side, we do, do a lot of work for those clients. We do valuations work. We do property management work. Obviously, we do building sales work. We do debt financing work for them. So there is a lot we do for the investor clients. They're in the capital markets side of the business as well. Those solutions don't tend to be as integrated as the occupier solutions are, but there's plenty we do, and we have some enormous clients on that side that we interface with on an account basis as opposed to a one-by-one transactional basis. Yes. Jade, it is a fact that the path to data center land does fairly regularly run through logistics land sites that happen to have adequate power. And because we have a big position in logistics land sites, that's one of the core competencies of Trammell Crow Company to identify and acquire logistics land sites. We are seeing some opportunity there that we're quite confident will result in strong financial returns for us. And we, not surprisingly, given that have a proactive effort underway to identify more of that land. We alluded to it a little bit over the last few quarters. This amount of pent-up profits in our in-process portfolio, the fact that we've put incremental balance sheet capital into the development business when others were on the sideline. That's a significant strategic initiative for us that's probably more prominent than appears on the surface. Well, there's some good insights in that question, Jade. I want to start by saying we are not contemplating trading off Trammell Crow Company because it does so \u2013 not only is it a really good, really well-run business that generates high returns and creates opportunities for them to invest our capital. But it does interface really productively with other parts of our business, and I'm going to give you an example. During the middle of the COVID stay-at-home era. We started a fund called USLP. It's a fund that exists in our Investment Management business. We've told part of this story before, but it was seeded by a portfolio of Trammell Crow Company industrial development projects, plus also using our own balance sheet to secure a couple of portfolios. And anybody that watches the investment management business knows how hard it is to scale a core-plus fund early on. We started that fund in COVID, put the whole thing together by Zoom. None of the meetings, none of the interface was done in person. Started during COVID. From a standing start, that fund today is $5 billion. That fund would not exist in all probability without Trammell Crow Company. And Trammell Crow Company gives us opportunities to do that in other areas. We've got all kinds of things we're looking at with Trammell Crow Company and our Investment Management business together. Another example, and we've alluded to this too, there \u2013 we got $2 billion-plus manufacturing plants that we're handling the land acquisition, land development and project management on in a venture between Turner & Townsend and Trammell Crow Company. If you talk to Denselancy at Turner & Townsend, or Danny Queen and the Trammell Crow Company, they would tell you neither one of them would have done those deals alone. We think that positions them well to do more of that. That's the kind of thing that gives us confidence about where this business is going to go. So not only is on a kind of freestanding basis is Trammell Crow Company, a really good business for us to have. It does a lot with our other businesses. The other thing I'll say is it generates a lot of cash with immediate cash conversion that we can use to invest all over CBRE. So a lot that can be done with that business. Industrial leasing is trending up, not at the rate that office leasing is. And one of the reasons for that is there's some huge, huge users of industrial space that everybody is aware of. And they took down a lot of space over the last few years, and there -- and they've got vacancy in their portfolios that they're burning through. We think that, that's going to kind of come through the pipeline over the next year or 2 years and that demand will then pick back up on the leasing side after that. But we do expect leasing for Industrial to be better next year, although not dramatically better than it was this year. We've got a bunch of exposure to data centers, Tony. We already talked about the land plays that Trammell Crow Company is making that give us opportunities to profit there. Turner & Townsend has in excess of 110 hyperscale data centers that they're project managing. We have a data center services business where we manage data centers on behalf of occupiers, we manage between 700 and 800 data centers in that business. We just did the direct line acquisition that has \u2013 the early returns on that are really encouraging, and we synergize that with that Data Center Services business. And that does small projects inside the inside the white lines and data centers. So that's very strong. We have a data center sales business in our Advisory business that's very, very capable. And with all those things going on in data centers where we have prominent positions, we are doing a decent amount of strategy work as to how we could extract more from that and where we can go from here. We're not ready to describe any specific strategic initiatives yet, but we've got a lot of exposure, a lot of expertise, and we're exploring opportunities. Thanks, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you again when we report our year-end results."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chandni Luthra, Executive Vice President, Head of FP&A and Investor Relations. Thank you, Sunny. You may begin.\nChandni Luthra: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks and an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. Before we kick off today's call, I want to say how excited I am to have joined CBRE last month. I know many of you will already and others I'm looking forward to getting to know better in the weeks and months ahead. Now I'll remind you that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements, including without limitation, concerning expected benefits and synergies from the combination of Turner and Townsend and CBRE project management and other M&A transactions, our business outlook, our business plan and capital allocation strategy and our earnings and cash flow outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release in our SEC filings. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. I am joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our Chair and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now please turn to Slide 5 as I turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Chandni, and welcome to CBRE. Good morning, everyone. CBRE had a successful second quarter for 3 reasons: first, revenue, profitability and cash flow exceeded our expectations. Second, we made several sizable capital investments consistent with explicit elements of our strategy. Third, we made quick material progress on the cost challenges we identified last quarter. I'll briefly touch on all 3. As a reminder, when M&I referenced our performance relative to expectations, we are comparing results to the outlook provided on our last quarterly call. With this in mind, each of our 3 business segments outperformed expectations for both net revenue and segment operating profits. Highlights included Turner & Townsend, 18% and net revenue increase and revenue growth of 13% in U.S. leasing and 20% in mortgage origination fees. We believe that our advisory segment is on the cusp of an inflection point. On capital deployment, we made significant commitments in the quarter in support of our strategy. Combining CBRE project management with Turner & Townsend, will create an exceptional operator in an enormous space with significant secular tailwinds, given its scale this combined business will have a profound impact on the future of CBRE. I'll discuss the implications of this move in more detail following Emma's remarks. We continue to make investments that take advantage of the lack of capital available for well-positioned real estate opportunities by committing approximately $250 million in the second quarter to development projects, we believe can be harvested at favorable times in the cycle. Our investment management, development and brokerage businesses enable us to identify and execute these opportunities, and our balance sheet gives us the capacity to act on them. Finally, our acquisition of Direct Line Global enhances our capabilities in data center management, a huge market that is growing rapidly. Regarding progress on costs, actions taken in our GWS segment resulted in improved margin versus Q1. This, coupled with new business wins has put us back on track to achieve full year margin expansion, along with mid-teens top line growth and mid- to high teens bottom line growth in this segment. Taking all of this into account, along with our expectations of a strong second half, we have increased our outlook for full year core EPS to a range of $4.70 to $4.90, up from $4.25 to $4.65 previously. Now Emma will discuss our second quarter results and outlook in greater detail. Emma?\nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by highlighting the strong performance of our resilient businesses and an improvement in transaction activity. As a reminder, our resilient businesses include facilities management, project management, property management, loan servicing, valuations and investment management fees. Together, these businesses increased net revenue by 14%, reflecting double-digit organic growth and a strong contribution from M&A. Notably, our GWS and Advisory segments together delivered double-digit net revenue growth for the first time in 18 months, with combined leasing and capital markets revenue increasing for the second consecutive quarter. Our REI segment has also seen an upturn in activity, contracting to sell multiple development assets at attractive valuations, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter. Now please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the advisory segment. Advisory net revenue rose 9%, with growth in every line of business, except property sales. Globally, leasing revenue exceeded our expectations, led by 13% growth in the U.S., including a nearly 30% jump in office revenue. New York, a bellwether for CBRE was a key driver of the increase. Retail, albeit relatively small, also exhibited strength while industrial activity declined. Leasing momentum has continued in July, supported by a pickup in demand in many large U.S. office markets. Turning to Global Property sales. Revenue began to stabilize, declining only 2% on a local currency basis and 3% in U.S. dollar terms. A 4% decline in the U.S. was somewhat offset by growth in the U.K. where property values have largely reset. While APAC was down in dollar terms, sales revenue ticked up slightly in local currency. Our mortgage origination business produced very strong growth, supported by a 20% increase in origination fees. Loan origination growth was driven by debt funds, which are offering short-term refinancing to bridge the gap until interest rates decline. Advisory's net revenue from resilient businesses rose 11% in aggregate. And overall, advisory SOP rose 9% and net margins ticked up slightly compared with Q2 2023. Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of the GWS segment. The segment's net revenue rose 16%, above our expectations, and we are pleased that organic growth also improved by double digits. GWS delivered strong business wins with a healthy balance of new clients and expansions. In addition to robust sales conversion, our pipeline is up more than 6% from the end of 2023. And driven by technology and energy sectors. Product Management net revenue delivered double-digit growth. Bob will go deeper on Turner & Townsend, a business that we do not believe is fully appreciated later in the call. Turning to Facilities Management. Net revenue rose 18% and 11% on an organic basis. We committed nearly $300 million in facilities management M&A in the quarter. Most of the capital went to the Direct Line acquisition, which positions us to accelerate our growth in data center management, an estimated $30 billion market that is growing rapidly. We also acquired a small local facilities management business in Canada. Local Facilities Management started as a U.K.-focused business that had $630 million gross revenue in 2013. And is now a global business with $3.1 billion of gross revenue in 2023, a 17% compound annual growth rate. This business has significant headroom, especially in North America. GWS' net OP margin improved by 20 basis points from the first quarter to 10.1%, better than expected, reflecting our decisive cost actions. We expect to see year-over-year margin expansion in our full year results as those cost actions take effect. Please turn to Slide 8 as I discuss the REI results. Segment operating profit was slightly better than expected, although significantly lower than prior year, driven by the absence of meaningful development project sales. This is consistent with our plans going into the year, but we now believe we are approaching a period when we again generate significant profits from the sale of development assets. Investment Management operating profit was better than expected, largely due to higher co-investment returns. AUM is now at more than $142 billion. The $3.6 billion we've raised thus far this year was offset primarily by lower asset values as well as adverse FX movements. However, asset value declines have moderated, and we have seen evidence of valuation stabilizing in certain preferred asset classes in the U.S. and Europe. Investor sentiment continues to improve with increased appetite for both core and enhanced return strategies. Now I'll discuss cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. Free cash flow improved meaningfully to $220 million and conversion was nearly 90% for the quarter. We are increasing our free cash flow outlook for the year to slightly over $1 billion and now expect to be end the year with about 1 turn of net leverage even after deploying $1.3 billion of capital thus far in 2024 across M&A and co-investments. Our year-to-date 2024 capital deployment brings our 3-year total to approximately $4.8 billion, $3.7 billion in M&A and over $1 million in REI co-investments. M&A is integral to our strategy of enhancing our capabilities in parts of our business that are secularly favored or cyclically resilient. The acquisitions we executed in this quarter are clear examples of advancing this strategy. Our investments in development have accelerated and put us in a position to harvest as much as $750 million in profits over the next 4 years. Our combined in-process portfolio and pipeline now stands at nearly $32 billion. Over the last few years, when many developers were on the sidelines, our teams have taken advantage of this opportune time in the cycle to source industrial, multifamily and data center land sites in highly desirable locations. We anticipate strong growth and returns from M&A and co-investments and expect to continue making highly accretive investments supported by our strong balance sheet. Please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our outlook. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our expectations for full year core EPS to the range of $4.70 to $4.90, driven by higher revenue in SOP in each segment. We anticipate a very strong fourth quarter, which should account for just over 45% of our full year EPS. Within advisory, we now expect mid- to high teens SOP growth driven by stronger-than-expected transaction activity. For GWS, we anticipate mid-teens net revenue growth and a full year net SOP margin that is better than the 11.3% we produced in 2023. Our improved outlook is driven by the facilities management acquisitions in Q2 and the effects of our cost actions. For REI, our improved SOP outlook is primarily due to the large development asset sales expected to be completed in Q4, which we believe portends an upturn in this business. Before I conclude, let me take a minute to update you on our longer-term outlook. We have increased confidence in achieving record EPS in 2025, assuming a continued supportive macroeconomic environment. A return to peak core EPS, just 2 years following our earnings trough reflects how well we've improved the resiliency of our business compared with prior downturns. We expect even stronger resiliency in the next cycle as a result of the moves we are making. There are several reasons for our increased confidence in our outlook. First, we expect continued double-digit growth across our resilient businesses, which are on track to contribute $1.8 billion of SOP for full year 2024, up from nearly $1.6 billion in 2023. Second, while it's difficult to predict the cadence of the recovery, we can achieve record earnings without an accelerated rebound in transaction activity. Finally, we expect additional strong growth from the capital deployment plans I described earlier. Taking all of this into account, we have great confidence in sustaining a double-digit long-term growth trajectory. With that, I'll hand the call back to Bob.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks, Emma. I'll close with some thoughts about Turner & Townsend. While Turner & Townsend has some similarities to traditional commercial real estate project management businesses, its differences are significant and compelling. Beyond traditional corporate real estate project management, Turner & Townsend manages large complex programs in the infrastructure, natural resources and green energy sectors. Examples of this include their work for the Sydney Australia rapid transit system, the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority, Toronto and Abu Dhabi's international airports, and the first new nuclear power station to be constructed in the United Kingdom in over 20 years. These programs typically span many years and include an array of individual projects. When Turner & Townsend project work for corporate clients, it typically involves larger, more complex, strategically important assignments. For instance, they are currently program or project managing 112 hyperscale data centers and the creation of multiple billion dollar plus advanced manufacturing plants around the world. Turner & Townsend is also the world's largest cost consultancy, a rapidly growing practice that secures the best pricing from the marketplace and optimizes cost performance across large complex capital programs. The combination of Turner & Townsend and CBRE project management will create significant revenue synergies between the 2 businesses client bases and yield meaningful cost synergies through economies of scale and eliminating redundant functions. Turner & Townsend's leadership team will oversee the combined business. They have an exceptional track record in the areas of growth, strategic decision-making and risk management. Since Vincent Clancy took over as CEO in 2008, Turner & Townsend's net revenue has grown from approximately $225 million to $1.5 billion in 2023 and a compound annual growth rate of 13%. Since CBRE acquired our 60% ownership interest in November 2021 and Turner & Townsend's net revenue has grown at a compounded rate of nearly 20%, attesting to the benefits of being part of CBRE's platform. Finally, I want to stress that the combined business, which is positioned to provide years of resilient double-digit growth is large. It is expected to generate approximately $3.5 billion of net revenue and more than $0.5 billion of SOP in 2024. The business will be large enough resilient enough and rapidly growing enough to change the long-term profile of CBRE. Now operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Congrats on a great quarter. Just starting with the GWS business. You talked about sort of the full year margin improvement being above last year, but all the cost sort of impact is going to take place in the second half, presumably second half is also going to be much higher than the first half. So how do we think about sort of annualizing the second half margin? Is that sort of a good run rate going forward for the business?\nEmma Giamartino: So Ronald, what you saw in Q2 is that we took a lot of cost actions in our margin within Q2 and at 10.1% was above what we are expecting and above what we achieved in Q1. And it's obviously not near the run rate that we expect to target. For the full year, we're expecting the overall margin to be above that 11.3% that we delivered last year. So you're going to see higher margins in the second half. And then going into next year, that run rate will be even higher than where we get to for the full year. But we're not going to get to the second half margins on a run rate basis.\nRonald Kamdem: Got it. That's helpful. And then just my second 1 is just on the Advisory expectations and transaction activity. Maybe can you just talk about what you're seeing on the ground? What are you seeing in the pipeline? Obviously, maybe a better rate backdrop but what sort of gives you confidence and conviction that you're seeing these green shoots given that we have had fits and starts in the past\nBob Sulentic: Ronald, first of all, thanks for picking up coverage on us. We're thrilled to have Morgan Stanley following us. The first part of the answer to your question is very anecdotal. We had the quarter, we had in leasing and mortgage originations in the second quarter. And the positive activity has continued into the first part of the third quarter, and I'm going to pass it to Emma to let you talk -- let her talk a little bit more about that. But there are some other things that are giving us confidence. So for instance, we get insight from the fact that we do a lot of different things. We're not only are we an intermediary, but we're a principal. And in our development business now, we are seeing demand for projects that we didn't expect and it's going to happen in the fourth quarter of this year. That gives us confidence that other parts of the capital markets are acting that way. Obviously, there's a sentiment out there that there's going to be a couple of rate cuts or at least one rate cut this year. the bid-ask spreads are narrower than they were before, except maybe in office. Our investment sales brokers and mortgage brokers are more active and have stronger pipelines than they did before. Our work with office tenants, where we measure through all kinds of different mechanisms and surveys sentiment has gotten better. So we have this anecdotal evidence from the second quarter starting and then the third quarter. And then we have more technical evidence that causes us to think that we may well have gone through an inflection point on transactions that's going to impact leasing. It's going to impact sales. It's going to impact mortgage brokerage, and it's going to have a really nice impact in the fourth quarter on the profitability of our development business. Emma, you might want to add to that.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. So Ronald, what we're seeing on the leasing side is that continues to pick up globally. In the U.S., you're -- we talked about we're seeing the greatest strength in office leasing. Industrial has been declining slightly, but office is more than making up for that. And so continuing into July, we're seeing early signs of accelerating growth within leasing. And we think that would be a great outcome. So we're expecting that to continue through the remainder of the year. On the sales side, we do see strong signs that the sales market is stabilizing. Globally, we're still seeing declines, but you can argue that it's relatively flat globally. Sales activity for us revenue in the quarter was only down 2% on a local currency basis. And we're actually seeing going into July. And again, it's very early. So we're not going to call anything, but we're starting to see an uptick in activity in the U.S. sales market.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Bob, you talked about the distinction between Turner & Townsend and just the more traditional commercial real estate businesses. I mean -- is that something that you would consider spinning off at some point? I mean, you kind of talked quite a bit about those differences and making this disclosure change. So it seemed like maybe you do think of this as being a bit different than the rest of what CBRE does?\nBob Sulentic: Tony, it's different. But there's a lot of synergy between what Turner & Townsend does and what we do, and it's 2-way synergy. They're -- they operate in 60 countries around the world, and they're more substantial in parts of the world than we are. We've been able to introduce them to our client base in a number of places very successfully. And I'm going to give you an anecdote, and I'm going to give you some numbers, one that's repetitive. Turner Townsend grew over Vince Clancy's tenure 13% for many, many years on a compounded basis, more than a decade. Since they've been part of us, they've grown at 20%. Anecdotally, and I mentioned earlier, where we benefit from having a whole bunch of different businesses that we undertake. Anecdotally, there are a couple of major corporate manufacturing plants that Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend, are cooperating on to deliver the development services work and the program management work billion-plus dollar plant, we believe at Trammell Crow Company, and we believe that Turner & Townsend, and Vince and his team believe that those projects wouldn't have been landed by us, had we not had the ability for those 2 businesses to cooperate. So Turner & Townsend would be a great public company, make no mistake about it. There's a lot of enthusiasm for companies like them in the public markets today. They're very unique even relative to other large program and project management firms and large engineering firms. But they fit really, really nicely with us. And we think there's going to be a great story long term there. We've put Vince on our board because we think there's so much synergy between what he and his business do and what the rest of our company does. So I hope they're a very long-term part of CBRE.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And when the disclosure has changed, then have sort of the remaining facilities business and then the project management, how should we think about just organic growth for the facility is a piece of it, because it sounds like project management is going to be pretty high. Just where does that lead facility is?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. Facilities management, we believe, has a low double-digit organic revenue growth trajectory for the very long term, and that's supported by 2 components. One, the enterprise side, which is where we manage large occupier clients globally, that business should grow at a high single-digit rate. And that's where you see most of our competitors play in that space. So where our facilities management business is different from our competitors is our local business. And that's, as you know, the regionally focused business that I talked about in my remarks that has grown in a 17% compound rate. over the past decade. And that business should grow at the low to mid-teens rate, which is bringing up and even higher over time, and we expect to do M&A within the local sector, so that on an organic basis, we are confident that we'll remain in the low double-digit range. And then M&A on top of that will get us higher.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Got it. And if I could just ask one more question just on the guidance. How much of the [BOM] should we think about as coming from just the outlook for selling more stuff than Trammell Crow and the development gains there?\nEmma Giamartino: So we increased guidance across all 3 segments. So I'll walk through all 3 of them. Within Advisory, as you'd expect, increase in transaction activity, and we're getting to mid- to high teens SOP growth. Within GWS, the increase is largely due to M&A. Our organic growth expectations are in line with what we expected going into the year. And we're getting to mid- to high teens SOP growth for the year within GWS as well. And then REI is probably about past of the contribution for the increase in guidance and those couple of very large development deals that we expect to monetize in the fourth quarter. And when you look at the second half, what you're seeing is accelerated growth across all segments. Advisory, you're going to see low double-digit revenue growth in the second half, but very strong SOP growth as we have very strong high incremental margins across our leasing and sales business. And then GWS, as we've talked about, we've expected very strong revenue growth in the second half as both M&A picks up in the second half and as the large contracts that we won earlier this year and late last year start to be onboarded. And again, we've done a lot of cross works. You're going to see higher than higher than our run rate margins within GWS in the second half as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani with KBW.\nJade Rahmani: On capital market side, could you characterize the tone and tenor from participants in the quarter. Property sales were still down year-on-year, but commercial mortgage surged. Could you please provide some color on what you're seeing?\nEmma Giamartino: So on the commercial mortgage side, we saw a strong uptick in loan origination, and that was primarily for refinancing. So there is a big uptick in loan source from debt funds. Volumes from debt funds increased by over 70% in the quarter. And that was all refinancing. They're offering very short-term bridge loans to bridge providers until the banks and the agencies pick up. We actually saw a decline in originations from banks and the agencies as well. So we expect that to pick up in the second half of the year as rates come down.\nJade Rahmani: On the sales side, are you seeing an uptick in acquisitions yet? Or is it still pretty subdued there most of deal flows on the debt side?\nEmma Giamartino: We're still seeing -- we're having a slight uptick in acquisitions, but it's off such a low base that it's not meaningful. It's not a meaningful contributor to our increase.\nJade Rahmani: On the leasing side, many office tenants continue to shrink on average, somewhere around 10%, 12%. But activity was so substituted the past 2 years, you are seeing an uptick. Could you talk about that and also comment on retail?\nEmma Giamartino: So on the office side, we are -- we think we've stabilized in terms of size of transactions, and we're really seeing an uptick in volume, and we're seeing our uptick in terms of regionally we talked about it, you're seeing most of that increase in New York as occupiers are transacting across larger deals. We aren't seeing big movements in terms of square footage per transaction in terms of, obviously, rent per transaction, all of those metrics seem to have stabilized.\nJade Rahmani: And lastly, on the REI uptick, is that primarily driven by multifamily. I believe that's around 30% of the pipeline. Could you comment as to the percentage of gains. Are they going to be lower than historical due to the cost inflation we've seen as well as interest rates? Or do you think the demand for new products is outweighing that?\nBob Sulentic: Jade, let me ask you to clarify that. When you say REI, are you talking about development or the investment management business?\nJade Rahmani: Yes. Sorry, I should have clarified. Within REI, the Trammell Crow business.\nBob Sulentic: The activity we're seeing is across 3 product types, data centers, industrial and multifamily. The stuff we harvest in the fourth quarter is going to be more skewed towards data centers than it ever has been before. That -- and what's happened there, and again, I don't mean to be too repetitive in what I say. But because of the number of things we're doing across our platform, we end up being in a very strong position to generate certain kind of benefits that we wouldn't other generate. We wouldn't otherwise generate. Trammell Crow Company, when you hear the headlines, there's a developer. We build this kind of building or that kind of building when we sell it. But one of the things that Trammell Crow Company is exceptional at is land acquisition, entitlements and then developing on the land or harvesting land sites at a profit. The development work they've done over time on the industrial side has put Trammell Crow Company in a position to end up with considerable amounts of land that can be used for data centers. When that happens, the transition from industrial land to data center land generally results in pretty significant profitability, and that's going to be a big part of the picture you see in the fourth quarter. Looking out a little further, though, what's really, really important to know is that there has been a real lack of capital for securing development -- new development opportunities in the market the last couple of years. We went through that ourselves third-party capital slowed way down. That started to come back significantly. We've capitalized a good number of development projects with third-party capital this year. But the other thing we've done is we've come in ourselves, and we've identified opportunities in a bigger way than we have historically to use our own balance sheet to buy development land and in some cases, fund components of the development process beyond the land -- and we are -- we study it very closely. We are quite confident that we are going to be developing projects and in particular, multifamily projects into markets where the number of new projects coming online has slowed down dramatically. And that's what you're seeing or hearing in our comments about profitability coming out of that business.\nJade Rahmani: Can you say whether the increase in guidance or the uptick in REI in the fourth quarter is predominantly due to the data center sales. I have in my coverage team homebuilders, for example, sell land parcels, they intended for residential to data center developers and they've generated huge gains, but those really are not as sustainable as their regular business.\nEmma Giamartino: So the uptick in the fourth quarter is large -- in REI, is largely related to the data center asset sales. But the comment around is whether that's sustainable. I think one of the pieces that we really focused on in our remarks is the embedded profits within our Trammell Crow in-process and pipeline portfolio. And we talked about $750 million of profit that are in that portfolio today at relatively conservative underwriting assumptions that we expect to generate over the next 4 years. Now that will be more weighted towards the out years as it takes time to build these projects. But there is a significant amount of earnings embedded in that portfolio and is very much sustainable. And we do think that, that element of our business is underappreciated, the amount of profits that will be coming out of that. And so when you look at these data center sales that we're expecting this year, we believe that, that's a signal to us that there is an upturn in this business coming and there will be an uptick from here.\nBob Sulentic: If I could, I may just add on to that. And Jade, to specifically address what you said and that $750 million does not depend on all kinds of good luck with industrial sites transitioning to be data center sites. That's an asset-by-asset review of our portfolio. For the purposes that we acquired it for unless we know today that it's going to move to another asset class and measuring where we think it will come out over time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Griffin with Citi.\nMichael Griffin: Just want to go to capital deployment for my first question. Obviously, you guys have been so far this first half of the year, whether it's through M&A or buying back stock. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of how you weigh kind of those opportunities against each other. Is there a time where your stock price might hit a certain dollar amount, you're like all right at the time to really get aggressive here and just kind of how you weigh those 2 factors against each other. Color there would be appreciated.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. So our strategies remain consistent in terms of capital deployment. We prioritize M&A and we're focused on looking at strategic, highly accretive acquisitions that drive a very strong return and will enhance our capabilities, we've been very focused on facilities management and project management. We expect both of those to ticking up over the next few years. Our pipeline is very strong, though we always caution that it's very difficult to predict M&A, and we are extremely diligent in our underwriting. And so we focus on the deals that make the most sense and are going to drive the strongest return. And then in every single one of our deals, they have to exceed a hurdle rate that makes sense and they have to exceed the return that we would get from share repurchases. So we look at where we're [indiscernible] trading compared to your extrinsic value and make sure that those deals exceed that. If we don't have a tremendous amount of M&A in our pipeline or it's difficult to execute for whatever reason, and you've seen this in the past 3 years, we will buy back our shares. This year, we've done a lot of M&A so far, so I don't expect a tremendous amount of repurchases in the second half of the year, but that's simply a result of the amount of capital we've deployed this year.\nMichael Griffin: Emma, can you give us a sense of kind of those hurdle rates you're underwriting for potential M&A opportunities?\nEmma Giamartino: So well above our cost of capital. Most of our deals -- I think all of our deals are underwritten at above the mid-teens returns. And that's pretty much all I can say about that.\nMichael Griffin: Great. That's helpful. And then my second question was just kind of on the leasing. I know you touched on it earlier, particularly for the office side. But -- are you seeing this greater demand coming from all office products broadly? Or is it just in kind of that [Tropin] Class A product. And then you called out New York as a relative bright spot, but I'm wondering if there are any other big markets either domestically or globally, that surprised you to the upside?\nBob Sulentic: Well, for sure, Class A office space is really attractive now because so many companies are focused on the experience of their employees, the productivity of their employees, the presence of their employees, et cetera, that's a well-documented dynamic. And it's easier to make that happen in better quality office space. But beyond New York, yes, in the tech markets, we're seeing considerable pickup. And I believe -- we believe that it's driven by AI and all the activity around AI, the Bay Area, Austin, Texas, et cetera. We're seeing a pickup in those markets.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Most of my questions have been asked. But I guess 1 small just follow-up. I know the share buybacks was relatively light in the quarter, but I didn't necessarily see a the actual shares bought back or an average price on the buybacks. I don't know if you have that.\nEmma Giamartino: In the quarter, it was minimal. We repurchased $50 million worth of shares at an average price off $87.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. And then maybe, Bob, just on the cost containment, obviously, that seemed to maybe come through much faster than I think you expected and we expected, maybe just speak to that a little bit. And I guess just how are you thinking about talent retention and talent acquisition at this part of the cycle? And how does that maybe affect or not affect kind of the margins going forward?\nBob Sulentic: Steve, we have a philosophy about our business here that we want to drive this company in a way that we perform at a high level in everything we do. One of the things that we're doing in that regard is focusing more and more on getting rid of costs that don't contribute to the success of the company. Cost of every kind, technology projects that don't contribute, people that don't contribute office space that doesn't contribute. And the stuff that does contribute good office space, good technology, good people, we are aggressive buyers of those things to build our business. And what's happened is, and we have a transformation office that reports to analysts, so I ought to let Emma comment on that is we are aggressively looking for those things we can get rid of, and you saw that happen in the second quarter. But the stuff we need, we're aggressive buyers. We're aggressive buyers of land. We're aggressive buyers of talent. We brought on some spectacular talent in the last quarter. We have an aggressive technology investment program, but we are narrowing the things that we're investing in and being very careful. And Emma, if you want to add to that?\nEmma Giamartino: Yes, I will add. Our transformation office is focused on making long-term sustainable change in how we operate our business. And so we are not focused on episodic cost reduction we want to be focused on delivering consistent operating leverage over time. So you can see that margin expansion. And that's not an easy thing to do. It's something that we're very focused on. All of our business leaders are very focused on, so from here on out, everything is focused on really driving that efficiency. And as we add resources as we invest in technology, as we invest in people, those are extremely smart decisions so that we know that down the road, we don't have to cut back.\nOperator: Our next question is from Stephen Sheldon with William Blair.\nStephen Sheldon: Nice work here. First, now that you'll have direct line, are there other pieces you might need to pursue a comprehensive facility management solution around data centers and GWS. And just generally, how are you thinking about that opportunity and the differentiation of your capabilities now relative to peers and others playing in that market?\nBob Sulentic: Stephen, to answer that question, I want to back up and talk about how we think about M&A. And I think M&I would agree that there's more work we have to do on our side to get the market that invests in CBRE's shares to understand how we do M&A. First of all, we don't have a group of businesses and a group of leaders that sits there and waits for something to come up for sale at a good price. We are a very strategy-driven company. Each of our businesses has a strategy for how they want to grow. And that strategy is very attentive to, a, adding capabilities and b, adding capabilities in areas that we think will sustainably do well in the marketplace, either because they're cyclically resilient or they are secularly favored. There's no better example of that, obviously than Turner & Townsend. So if you look at our facilities management business, doing things that the marketplace wouldn't expect us to do because we've asked the leaders in the various sectors within facilities management, so manufacturing, financial technology, et cetera, to understand their business and the capabilities that they can be in that business that will differentiate it and make it attractive to our clients in the long run. They wouldn't go out in the marketplace seeking out those acquisitions. So the deals that you've heard us make in the last year, those -- we do not do those deals through auctions. None of those deals came to Turner & Townsend, wasn't done through an auction, J&J wasn't done through an auction. Direct Line wasn't done through an auction. The local FM business we bought in Canada, during the quarter wasn't done through an auction. Those were -- none of those were done through an auction. We went to the sellers of those businesses or the owners of those businesses and pursued them because we thought they were a good fit. We have ideas around our business. We have an increasingly well-developed corporate development team led by 14, 15-year Morgan Stanley veteran that then acts on those ideas to acquire them and we integrate them after that. That's our approach to M&A. And as a result, you should expect us to see -- you should expect to see us do more deals in the facilities management space and other spaces that you didn't expect because they aren't highly visible by others in the market.\nStephen Sheldon: Got it. Yes, that's really helpful. And then just, I guess, as a follow-up in investment management, can you just talk about what you're seeing on the fundraising side right now? Is the environment there changed as you look back over the last few months.\nEmma Giamartino: Yes. We've seen a pickup activity -- inactivity. We are expecting a pickup in activity in enhanced return strategies, but we've also seen a pickup in the first half in core and core plus. And I think you're hearing that broadly across the market, which we think is a very positive indicator for the remainder of the year.\nOperator: Now our next question is from Peter Abramowitz with Jefferies.\nPeter Abramowitz: I just wanted to ask about sort of the relative stabilization and resilience versus your expectation in the investment sales market. I guess could you just give more color on what you think is driving that? And could you comment and just give some more color on whether that's dry powder on the sidelines and how much kind of pent-up demand there is from the last couple of years a pretty depressed activity.\nBob Sulentic: Yes. Peter, you just said something that's really important, pent-up demand. When we talk about investment sales activity coming back, the trading of assets coming back. It's not going to be a circumstance whether the marketplace is going to become more attractive because rates have stabilized, bid-ask spreads have come down. And therefore, a bunch of people that wouldn't have otherwise been in the market are going to say, \"Oh, it's a better environment. Maybe I should sell something. \" There has been a massive base of assets held by people that wanted to sell them for the last couple of years. There has been a massive amount of capital on the sidelines that wanted to get in and do real estate deals for the last couple of years. The buyers and sellers have been there. We don't have to find them. They're there. What has to happen is the environment needs to get to a place where you're going to see people jump in and act. And what's happened is the certainty around interest rates coming down has grown the bid-ask spread has narrowed. There's less volatility in the market. And that's why in a business like our Trammell Crow Company development business, where we're a principal not an intermediary, we're seeing action very real action that's going to take place in the fourth quarter. We've been there with those assets. Now we're going to trade those assets because the environment is going to be right.\nPeter Abramowitz: Bob. I appreciate the color. And then I wanted to ask about specifically on the office leasing side. I guess just kind of looking at the algorithm between pricing and volume, obviously, volume is improving to start the first half of the year. Overall, I mean, are you still seeing pricing continuing to go up on those trophy assets? And then overall, in the broader market, if you zoom out to look at trophy as well as kind of Class A minus and then commodity below that, how is pricing trending? And how does that sort of affect your outlook for leasing revenues?\nBob Sulentic: Peter, Emma is a good one to answer that question because in addition to all the other things she does, she actually handles our real estate portfolio, and she's in the market now. And so she can tell you as a consumer what that feels like.\nEmma Giamartino: So on the office leasing side, and Bob is talking about locking in New York. For trophy assets, yes, especially in New York, those prices are increasing. But if you look broadly across our office leasing portfolio of transactions, pricing is pretty much stabilized, but there are very -- there's big differences in what's happening by asset type and by quality of assets and by market.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Bob Sulentic for any closing comments.\nBob Sulentic: Thanks for joining us, everyone, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the third quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and hello, everyone. I'll begin by highlighting the strong performance of our resilient businesses and an improvement in transaction activity. As a reminder, our resilient businesses include facilities management, project management, property management, loan servicing, valuations and investment management fees. Together, these businesses increased net revenue by 14%, reflecting double-digit organic growth and a strong contribution from M&A. Notably, our GWS and Advisory segments together delivered double-digit net revenue growth for the first time in 18 months, with combined leasing and capital markets revenue increasing for the second consecutive quarter. Our REI segment has also seen an upturn in activity, contracting to sell multiple development assets at attractive valuations, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter. Now please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the advisory segment. Advisory net revenue rose 9%, with growth in every line of business, except property sales. Globally, leasing revenue exceeded our expectations, led by 13% growth in the U.S., including a nearly 30% jump in office revenue. New York, a bellwether for CBRE was a key driver of the increase. Retail, albeit relatively small, also exhibited strength while industrial activity declined. Leasing momentum has continued in July, supported by a pickup in demand in many large U.S. office markets. Turning to Global Property sales. Revenue began to stabilize, declining only 2% on a local currency basis and 3% in U.S. dollar terms. A 4% decline in the U.S. was somewhat offset by growth in the U.K. where property values have largely reset. While APAC was down in dollar terms, sales revenue ticked up slightly in local currency. Our mortgage origination business produced very strong growth, supported by a 20% increase in origination fees. Loan origination growth was driven by debt funds, which are offering short-term refinancing to bridge the gap until interest rates decline. Advisory's net revenue from resilient businesses rose 11% in aggregate. And overall, advisory SOP rose 9% and net margins ticked up slightly compared with Q2 2023. Please turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of the GWS segment. The segment's net revenue rose 16%, above our expectations, and we are pleased that organic growth also improved by double digits. GWS delivered strong business wins with a healthy balance of new clients and expansions. In addition to robust sales conversion, our pipeline is up more than 6% from the end of 2023. And driven by technology and energy sectors. Product Management net revenue delivered double-digit growth. Bob will go deeper on Turner & Townsend, a business that we do not believe is fully appreciated later in the call. Turning to Facilities Management. Net revenue rose 18% and 11% on an organic basis. We committed nearly $300 million in facilities management M&A in the quarter. Most of the capital went to the Direct Line acquisition, which positions us to accelerate our growth in data center management, an estimated $30 billion market that is growing rapidly. We also acquired a small local facilities management business in Canada. Local Facilities Management started as a U.K.-focused business that had $630 million gross revenue in 2013. And is now a global business with $3.1 billion of gross revenue in 2023, a 17% compound annual growth rate. This business has significant headroom, especially in North America. GWS' net OP margin improved by 20 basis points from the first quarter to 10.1%, better than expected, reflecting our decisive cost actions. We expect to see year-over-year margin expansion in our full year results as those cost actions take effect. Please turn to Slide 8 as I discuss the REI results. Segment operating profit was slightly better than expected, although significantly lower than prior year, driven by the absence of meaningful development project sales. This is consistent with our plans going into the year, but we now believe we are approaching a period when we again generate significant profits from the sale of development assets. Investment Management operating profit was better than expected, largely due to higher co-investment returns. AUM is now at more than $142 billion. The $3.6 billion we've raised thus far this year was offset primarily by lower asset values as well as adverse FX movements. However, asset value declines have moderated, and we have seen evidence of valuation stabilizing in certain preferred asset classes in the U.S. and Europe. Investor sentiment continues to improve with increased appetite for both core and enhanced return strategies. Now I'll discuss cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 9. Free cash flow improved meaningfully to $220 million and conversion was nearly 90% for the quarter. We are increasing our free cash flow outlook for the year to slightly over $1 billion and now expect to be end the year with about 1 turn of net leverage even after deploying $1.3 billion of capital thus far in 2024 across M&A and co-investments. Our year-to-date 2024 capital deployment brings our 3-year total to approximately $4.8 billion, $3.7 billion in M&A and over $1 million in REI co-investments. M&A is integral to our strategy of enhancing our capabilities in parts of our business that are secularly favored or cyclically resilient. The acquisitions we executed in this quarter are clear examples of advancing this strategy. Our investments in development have accelerated and put us in a position to harvest as much as $750 million in profits over the next 4 years. Our combined in-process portfolio and pipeline now stands at nearly $32 billion. Over the last few years, when many developers were on the sidelines, our teams have taken advantage of this opportune time in the cycle to source industrial, multifamily and data center land sites in highly desirable locations. We anticipate strong growth and returns from M&A and co-investments and expect to continue making highly accretive investments supported by our strong balance sheet. Please turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of our outlook. As Bob mentioned, we are increasing our expectations for full year core EPS to the range of $4.70 to $4.90, driven by higher revenue in SOP in each segment. We anticipate a very strong fourth quarter, which should account for just over 45% of our full year EPS. Within advisory, we now expect mid- to high teens SOP growth driven by stronger-than-expected transaction activity. For GWS, we anticipate mid-teens net revenue growth and a full year net SOP margin that is better than the 11.3% we produced in 2023. Our improved outlook is driven by the facilities management acquisitions in Q2 and the effects of our cost actions. For REI, our improved SOP outlook is primarily due to the large development asset sales expected to be completed in Q4, which we believe portends an upturn in this business. Before I conclude, let me take a minute to update you on our longer-term outlook. We have increased confidence in achieving record EPS in 2025, assuming a continued supportive macroeconomic environment. A return to peak core EPS, just 2 years following our earnings trough reflects how well we've improved the resiliency of our business compared with prior downturns. We expect even stronger resiliency in the next cycle as a result of the moves we are making. There are several reasons for our increased confidence in our outlook. First, we expect continued double-digit growth across our resilient businesses, which are on track to contribute $1.8 billion of SOP for full year 2024, up from nearly $1.6 billion in 2023. Second, while it's difficult to predict the cadence of the recovery, we can achieve record earnings without an accelerated rebound in transaction activity. Finally, we expect additional strong growth from the capital deployment plans I described earlier. Taking all of this into account, we have great confidence in sustaining a double-digit long-term growth trajectory. With that, I'll hand the call back to Bob. So Ronald, what you saw in Q2 is that we took a lot of cost actions in our margin within Q2 and at 10.1% was above what we are expecting and above what we achieved in Q1. And it's obviously not near the run rate that we expect to target. For the full year, we're expecting the overall margin to be above that 11.3% that we delivered last year. So you're going to see higher margins in the second half. And then going into next year, that run rate will be even higher than where we get to for the full year. But we're not going to get to the second half margins on a run rate basis. Yes. So Ronald, what we're seeing on the leasing side is that continues to pick up globally. In the U.S., you're -- we talked about we're seeing the greatest strength in office leasing. Industrial has been declining slightly, but office is more than making up for that. And so continuing into July, we're seeing early signs of accelerating growth within leasing. And we think that would be a great outcome. So we're expecting that to continue through the remainder of the year. On the sales side, we do see strong signs that the sales market is stabilizing. Globally, we're still seeing declines, but you can argue that it's relatively flat globally. Sales activity for us revenue in the quarter was only down 2% on a local currency basis. And we're actually seeing going into July. And again, it's very early. So we're not going to call anything, but we're starting to see an uptick in activity in the U.S. sales market. Yes. Facilities management, we believe, has a low double-digit organic revenue growth trajectory for the very long term, and that's supported by 2 components. One, the enterprise side, which is where we manage large occupier clients globally, that business should grow at a high single-digit rate. And that's where you see most of our competitors play in that space. So where our facilities management business is different from our competitors is our local business. And that's, as you know, the regionally focused business that I talked about in my remarks that has grown in a 17% compound rate. over the past decade. And that business should grow at the low to mid-teens rate, which is bringing up and even higher over time, and we expect to do M&A within the local sector, so that on an organic basis, we are confident that we'll remain in the low double-digit range. And then M&A on top of that will get us higher. So we increased guidance across all 3 segments. So I'll walk through all 3 of them. Within Advisory, as you'd expect, increase in transaction activity, and we're getting to mid- to high teens SOP growth. Within GWS, the increase is largely due to M&A. Our organic growth expectations are in line with what we expected going into the year. And we're getting to mid- to high teens SOP growth for the year within GWS as well. And then REI is probably about past of the contribution for the increase in guidance and those couple of very large development deals that we expect to monetize in the fourth quarter. And when you look at the second half, what you're seeing is accelerated growth across all segments. Advisory, you're going to see low double-digit revenue growth in the second half, but very strong SOP growth as we have very strong high incremental margins across our leasing and sales business. And then GWS, as we've talked about, we've expected very strong revenue growth in the second half as both M&A picks up in the second half and as the large contracts that we won earlier this year and late last year start to be onboarded. And again, we've done a lot of cross works. You're going to see higher than higher than our run rate margins within GWS in the second half as well. So on the commercial mortgage side, we saw a strong uptick in loan origination, and that was primarily for refinancing. So there is a big uptick in loan source from debt funds. Volumes from debt funds increased by over 70% in the quarter. And that was all refinancing. They're offering very short-term bridge loans to bridge providers until the banks and the agencies pick up. We actually saw a decline in originations from banks and the agencies as well. So we expect that to pick up in the second half of the year as rates come down. We're still seeing -- we're having a slight uptick in acquisitions, but it's off such a low base that it's not meaningful. It's not a meaningful contributor to our increase. So on the office side, we are -- we think we've stabilized in terms of size of transactions, and we're really seeing an uptick in volume, and we're seeing our uptick in terms of regionally we talked about it, you're seeing most of that increase in New York as occupiers are transacting across larger deals. We aren't seeing big movements in terms of square footage per transaction in terms of, obviously, rent per transaction, all of those metrics seem to have stabilized. So the uptick in the fourth quarter is large -- in REI, is largely related to the data center asset sales. But the comment around is whether that's sustainable. I think one of the pieces that we really focused on in our remarks is the embedded profits within our Trammell Crow in-process and pipeline portfolio. And we talked about $750 million of profit that are in that portfolio today at relatively conservative underwriting assumptions that we expect to generate over the next 4 years. Now that will be more weighted towards the out years as it takes time to build these projects. But there is a significant amount of earnings embedded in that portfolio and is very much sustainable. And we do think that, that element of our business is underappreciated, the amount of profits that will be coming out of that. And so when you look at these data center sales that we're expecting this year, we believe that, that's a signal to us that there is an upturn in this business coming and there will be an uptick from here. Yes. So our strategies remain consistent in terms of capital deployment. We prioritize M&A and we're focused on looking at strategic, highly accretive acquisitions that drive a very strong return and will enhance our capabilities, we've been very focused on facilities management and project management. We expect both of those to ticking up over the next few years. Our pipeline is very strong, though we always caution that it's very difficult to predict M&A, and we are extremely diligent in our underwriting. And so we focus on the deals that make the most sense and are going to drive the strongest return. And then in every single one of our deals, they have to exceed a hurdle rate that makes sense and they have to exceed the return that we would get from share repurchases. So we look at where we're [indiscernible] trading compared to your extrinsic value and make sure that those deals exceed that. If we don't have a tremendous amount of M&A in our pipeline or it's difficult to execute for whatever reason, and you've seen this in the past 3 years, we will buy back our shares. This year, we've done a lot of M&A so far, so I don't expect a tremendous amount of repurchases in the second half of the year, but that's simply a result of the amount of capital we've deployed this year. So well above our cost of capital. Most of our deals -- I think all of our deals are underwritten at above the mid-teens returns. And that's pretty much all I can say about that. In the quarter, it was minimal. We repurchased $50 million worth of shares at an average price off $87. Yes, I will add. Our transformation office is focused on making long-term sustainable change in how we operate our business. And so we are not focused on episodic cost reduction we want to be focused on delivering consistent operating leverage over time. So you can see that margin expansion. And that's not an easy thing to do. It's something that we're very focused on. All of our business leaders are very focused on, so from here on out, everything is focused on really driving that efficiency. And as we add resources as we invest in technology, as we invest in people, those are extremely smart decisions so that we know that down the road, we don't have to cut back. Yes. We've seen a pickup activity -- inactivity. We are expecting a pickup in activity in enhanced return strategies, but we've also seen a pickup in the first half in core and core plus. And I think you're hearing that broadly across the market, which we think is a very positive indicator for the remainder of the year. So on the office leasing side, and Bob is talking about locking in New York. For trophy assets, yes, especially in New York, those prices are increasing. But if you look broadly across our office leasing portfolio of transactions, pricing is pretty much stabilized, but there are very -- there's big differences in what's happening by asset type and by quality of assets and by market."

            "content": "Thanks, Chandni, and welcome to CBRE. Good morning, everyone. CBRE had a successful second quarter for 3 reasons: first, revenue, profitability and cash flow exceeded our expectations. Second, we made several sizable capital investments consistent with explicit elements of our strategy. Third, we made quick material progress on the cost challenges we identified last quarter. I'll briefly touch on all 3. As a reminder, when M&I referenced our performance relative to expectations, we are comparing results to the outlook provided on our last quarterly call. With this in mind, each of our 3 business segments outperformed expectations for both net revenue and segment operating profits. Highlights included Turner & Townsend, 18% and net revenue increase and revenue growth of 13% in U.S. leasing and 20% in mortgage origination fees. We believe that our advisory segment is on the cusp of an inflection point. On capital deployment, we made significant commitments in the quarter in support of our strategy. Combining CBRE project management with Turner & Townsend, will create an exceptional operator in an enormous space with significant secular tailwinds, given its scale this combined business will have a profound impact on the future of CBRE. I'll discuss the implications of this move in more detail following Emma's remarks. We continue to make investments that take advantage of the lack of capital available for well-positioned real estate opportunities by committing approximately $250 million in the second quarter to development projects, we believe can be harvested at favorable times in the cycle. Our investment management, development and brokerage businesses enable us to identify and execute these opportunities, and our balance sheet gives us the capacity to act on them. Finally, our acquisition of Direct Line Global enhances our capabilities in data center management, a huge market that is growing rapidly. Regarding progress on costs, actions taken in our GWS segment resulted in improved margin versus Q1. This, coupled with new business wins has put us back on track to achieve full year margin expansion, along with mid-teens top line growth and mid- to high teens bottom line growth in this segment. Taking all of this into account, along with our expectations of a strong second half, we have increased our outlook for full year core EPS to a range of $4.70 to $4.90, up from $4.25 to $4.65 previously. Now Emma will discuss our second quarter results and outlook in greater detail. Emma? Thanks, Emma. I'll close with some thoughts about Turner & Townsend. While Turner & Townsend has some similarities to traditional commercial real estate project management businesses, its differences are significant and compelling. Beyond traditional corporate real estate project management, Turner & Townsend manages large complex programs in the infrastructure, natural resources and green energy sectors. Examples of this include their work for the Sydney Australia rapid transit system, the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority, Toronto and Abu Dhabi's international airports, and the first new nuclear power station to be constructed in the United Kingdom in over 20 years. These programs typically span many years and include an array of individual projects. When Turner & Townsend project work for corporate clients, it typically involves larger, more complex, strategically important assignments. For instance, they are currently program or project managing 112 hyperscale data centers and the creation of multiple billion dollar plus advanced manufacturing plants around the world. Turner & Townsend is also the world's largest cost consultancy, a rapidly growing practice that secures the best pricing from the marketplace and optimizes cost performance across large complex capital programs. The combination of Turner & Townsend and CBRE project management will create significant revenue synergies between the 2 businesses client bases and yield meaningful cost synergies through economies of scale and eliminating redundant functions. Turner & Townsend's leadership team will oversee the combined business. They have an exceptional track record in the areas of growth, strategic decision-making and risk management. Since Vincent Clancy took over as CEO in 2008, Turner & Townsend's net revenue has grown from approximately $225 million to $1.5 billion in 2023 and a compound annual growth rate of 13%. Since CBRE acquired our 60% ownership interest in November 2021 and Turner & Townsend's net revenue has grown at a compounded rate of nearly 20%, attesting to the benefits of being part of CBRE's platform. Finally, I want to stress that the combined business, which is positioned to provide years of resilient double-digit growth is large. It is expected to generate approximately $3.5 billion of net revenue and more than $0.5 billion of SOP in 2024. The business will be large enough resilient enough and rapidly growing enough to change the long-term profile of CBRE. Now operator, let's open the line for questions. Ronald, first of all, thanks for picking up coverage on us. We're thrilled to have Morgan Stanley following us. The first part of the answer to your question is very anecdotal. We had the quarter, we had in leasing and mortgage originations in the second quarter. And the positive activity has continued into the first part of the third quarter, and I'm going to pass it to Emma to let you talk -- let her talk a little bit more about that. But there are some other things that are giving us confidence. So for instance, we get insight from the fact that we do a lot of different things. We're not only are we an intermediary, but we're a principal. And in our development business now, we are seeing demand for projects that we didn't expect and it's going to happen in the fourth quarter of this year. That gives us confidence that other parts of the capital markets are acting that way. Obviously, there's a sentiment out there that there's going to be a couple of rate cuts or at least one rate cut this year. the bid-ask spreads are narrower than they were before, except maybe in office. Our investment sales brokers and mortgage brokers are more active and have stronger pipelines than they did before. Our work with office tenants, where we measure through all kinds of different mechanisms and surveys sentiment has gotten better. So we have this anecdotal evidence from the second quarter starting and then the third quarter. And then we have more technical evidence that causes us to think that we may well have gone through an inflection point on transactions that's going to impact leasing. It's going to impact sales. It's going to impact mortgage brokerage, and it's going to have a really nice impact in the fourth quarter on the profitability of our development business. Emma, you might want to add to that. Tony, it's different. But there's a lot of synergy between what Turner & Townsend does and what we do, and it's 2-way synergy. They're -- they operate in 60 countries around the world, and they're more substantial in parts of the world than we are. We've been able to introduce them to our client base in a number of places very successfully. And I'm going to give you an anecdote, and I'm going to give you some numbers, one that's repetitive. Turner Townsend grew over Vince Clancy's tenure 13% for many, many years on a compounded basis, more than a decade. Since they've been part of us, they've grown at 20%. Anecdotally, and I mentioned earlier, where we benefit from having a whole bunch of different businesses that we undertake. Anecdotally, there are a couple of major corporate manufacturing plants that Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend, are cooperating on to deliver the development services work and the program management work billion-plus dollar plant, we believe at Trammell Crow Company, and we believe that Turner & Townsend, and Vince and his team believe that those projects wouldn't have been landed by us, had we not had the ability for those 2 businesses to cooperate. So Turner & Townsend would be a great public company, make no mistake about it. There's a lot of enthusiasm for companies like them in the public markets today. They're very unique even relative to other large program and project management firms and large engineering firms. But they fit really, really nicely with us. And we think there's going to be a great story long term there. We've put Vince on our board because we think there's so much synergy between what he and his business do and what the rest of our company does. So I hope they're a very long-term part of CBRE. Jade, let me ask you to clarify that. When you say REI, are you talking about development or the investment management business? The activity we're seeing is across 3 product types, data centers, industrial and multifamily. The stuff we harvest in the fourth quarter is going to be more skewed towards data centers than it ever has been before. That -- and what's happened there, and again, I don't mean to be too repetitive in what I say. But because of the number of things we're doing across our platform, we end up being in a very strong position to generate certain kind of benefits that we wouldn't other generate. We wouldn't otherwise generate. Trammell Crow Company, when you hear the headlines, there's a developer. We build this kind of building or that kind of building when we sell it. But one of the things that Trammell Crow Company is exceptional at is land acquisition, entitlements and then developing on the land or harvesting land sites at a profit. The development work they've done over time on the industrial side has put Trammell Crow Company in a position to end up with considerable amounts of land that can be used for data centers. When that happens, the transition from industrial land to data center land generally results in pretty significant profitability, and that's going to be a big part of the picture you see in the fourth quarter. Looking out a little further, though, what's really, really important to know is that there has been a real lack of capital for securing development -- new development opportunities in the market the last couple of years. We went through that ourselves third-party capital slowed way down. That started to come back significantly. We've capitalized a good number of development projects with third-party capital this year. But the other thing we've done is we've come in ourselves, and we've identified opportunities in a bigger way than we have historically to use our own balance sheet to buy development land and in some cases, fund components of the development process beyond the land -- and we are -- we study it very closely. We are quite confident that we are going to be developing projects and in particular, multifamily projects into markets where the number of new projects coming online has slowed down dramatically. And that's what you're seeing or hearing in our comments about profitability coming out of that business. If I could, I may just add on to that. And Jade, to specifically address what you said and that $750 million does not depend on all kinds of good luck with industrial sites transitioning to be data center sites. That's an asset-by-asset review of our portfolio. For the purposes that we acquired it for unless we know today that it's going to move to another asset class and measuring where we think it will come out over time. Well, for sure, Class A office space is really attractive now because so many companies are focused on the experience of their employees, the productivity of their employees, the presence of their employees, et cetera, that's a well-documented dynamic. And it's easier to make that happen in better quality office space. But beyond New York, yes, in the tech markets, we're seeing considerable pickup. And I believe -- we believe that it's driven by AI and all the activity around AI, the Bay Area, Austin, Texas, et cetera. We're seeing a pickup in those markets. Steve, we have a philosophy about our business here that we want to drive this company in a way that we perform at a high level in everything we do. One of the things that we're doing in that regard is focusing more and more on getting rid of costs that don't contribute to the success of the company. Cost of every kind, technology projects that don't contribute, people that don't contribute office space that doesn't contribute. And the stuff that does contribute good office space, good technology, good people, we are aggressive buyers of those things to build our business. And what's happened is, and we have a transformation office that reports to analysts, so I ought to let Emma comment on that is we are aggressively looking for those things we can get rid of, and you saw that happen in the second quarter. But the stuff we need, we're aggressive buyers. We're aggressive buyers of land. We're aggressive buyers of talent. We brought on some spectacular talent in the last quarter. We have an aggressive technology investment program, but we are narrowing the things that we're investing in and being very careful. And Emma, if you want to add to that? Stephen, to answer that question, I want to back up and talk about how we think about M&A. And I think M&I would agree that there's more work we have to do on our side to get the market that invests in CBRE's shares to understand how we do M&A. First of all, we don't have a group of businesses and a group of leaders that sits there and waits for something to come up for sale at a good price. We are a very strategy-driven company. Each of our businesses has a strategy for how they want to grow. And that strategy is very attentive to, a, adding capabilities and b, adding capabilities in areas that we think will sustainably do well in the marketplace, either because they're cyclically resilient or they are secularly favored. There's no better example of that, obviously than Turner & Townsend. So if you look at our facilities management business, doing things that the marketplace wouldn't expect us to do because we've asked the leaders in the various sectors within facilities management, so manufacturing, financial technology, et cetera, to understand their business and the capabilities that they can be in that business that will differentiate it and make it attractive to our clients in the long run. They wouldn't go out in the marketplace seeking out those acquisitions. So the deals that you've heard us make in the last year, those -- we do not do those deals through auctions. None of those deals came to Turner & Townsend, wasn't done through an auction, J&J wasn't done through an auction. Direct Line wasn't done through an auction. The local FM business we bought in Canada, during the quarter wasn't done through an auction. Those were -- none of those were done through an auction. We went to the sellers of those businesses or the owners of those businesses and pursued them because we thought they were a good fit. We have ideas around our business. We have an increasingly well-developed corporate development team led by 14, 15-year Morgan Stanley veteran that then acts on those ideas to acquire them and we integrate them after that. That's our approach to M&A. And as a result, you should expect us to see -- you should expect to see us do more deals in the facilities management space and other spaces that you didn't expect because they aren't highly visible by others in the market. Yes. Peter, you just said something that's really important, pent-up demand. When we talk about investment sales activity coming back, the trading of assets coming back. It's not going to be a circumstance whether the marketplace is going to become more attractive because rates have stabilized, bid-ask spreads have come down. And therefore, a bunch of people that wouldn't have otherwise been in the market are going to say, \"Oh, it's a better environment. Maybe I should sell something. \" There has been a massive base of assets held by people that wanted to sell them for the last couple of years. There has been a massive amount of capital on the sidelines that wanted to get in and do real estate deals for the last couple of years. The buyers and sellers have been there. We don't have to find them. They're there. What has to happen is the environment needs to get to a place where you're going to see people jump in and act. And what's happened is the certainty around interest rates coming down has grown the bid-ask spread has narrowed. There's less volatility in the market. And that's why in a business like our Trammell Crow Company development business, where we're a principal not an intermediary, we're seeing action very real action that's going to take place in the fourth quarter. We've been there with those assets. Now we're going to trade those assets because the environment is going to be right. Peter, Emma is a good one to answer that question because in addition to all the other things she does, she actually handles our real estate portfolio, and she's in the market now. And so she can tell you as a consumer what that feels like. Thanks for joining us, everyone, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the third quarter."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brad Burke, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin. \nBradley Burke: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to CBRE's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Earlier today, we posted a presentation deck on our website that you can use to follow along with our prepared remarks and an Excel file that contains additional supplemental materials. \n Before we kick off today's call, I'll remind you that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements concerning our economic outlook, our business plans and capital allocation strategy and our financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results and trends to differ materially from those projected. For a full discussion of the risks and other factors that may impact these forward-looking statements, please refer to this morning's earnings release and our SEC filings. We have provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on our call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, together with explanations of these measures in our presentation deck appendix. \n I'm joined on today's call by Bob Sulentic, our Chair and CEO; and Emma Giamartino, our Chief Financial Officer. Now please turn to Slide 5, and I'll turn the call to Bob. \nRobert Sulentic: Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, it's important to note that Emma and I regularly reference our performance relative to expectations during these quarterly calls. In office, the expectations we are referencing are based on the outlook we provided during our most recent quarterly call. \n We started 2024 by delivering core earnings that exceeded our expectations. This was driven in part by solid net revenue growth. However, several notable elements of our performance differed from our time going into the year. I'll touch on 3 of them: leasing strength, property sales weakness and cost pressure. \n Leasing outperformed expectations, driven by office leasing growth globally, that reflects a resilient economy and companies making progress on bringing their employees back to the office. At the same time, persistent inflation kept interest rates higher than expected, which led to underperformance in our property sale transaction activity. \n Our Global Workplace Solutions segment again delivered double-digit net revenue growth even as margins fell short of expectations. Our costs in GWS have increased at an unacceptable rate, and we have initiated actions to bring them quickly back into line with revenue trajectory. These actions include consolidating the management of advisory and GWS under our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, with an explicit focus on rapidly ringing out unnecessary costs and better integrating the solutions we deliver for occupier clients. Significant progress has already been made on these efforts. \n We expect GWS' cost challenges to be mostly mitigated by year-end with the majority of our actions being initiated in the second quarter. As a result, this segment remains poised to achieve mid-teens SOP growth for the full year. Looking across the whole business. We remain confident that we will generate core earnings per share in the range of $4.25 to $4.65. Our confidence is underpinned by our resilient business' continued strong performance, our rapid actions on costs and the fact that advisory services remains on track to achieve its growth target for the year despite a more uncertain economic outlook. Emma will discuss the specifics of our outlook in greater detail after reviewing our first quarter performance. Emma? \nEmma Giamartino: Thanks, Bob. At a consolidated level, core EBITDA was in line with our expectations as slight outperformance in REI and lower-than-expected corporate costs offset margin underperformance in GWS. Advisory SOP performed as anticipated. \n Core [indiscernible] exceeded expectations due to a onetime tax benefit. Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the Advisory segment. Despite an interest rate outlook that's steadily worsened throughout the quarter, Advisory net revenue rose 3%, consistent with expectations, bolstered by its first quarter of transactional revenue growth in 6 quarters and growth from every line of business except property sales. \n Leasing revenue rose in every region, and global growth exceeded our expectations. Office leasing grew by double digits globally as a resilient economy and progress on return to office plans have been both intended to make occupancy decisions. We have continued to see strong momentum in U.S. leasing in April. \n Financial services companies are leading the recovery with active demand up more than 20% year-over-year of U.S. gateway markets, reflecting their considerable progress in bringing employees back to the office. Tech companies continue to lag with demand 50% below pre-COVID levels. \n Globally, property sales revenue declined 11% with weakness in the U.S. and APAC. EMEA is showing early signs of recovery with sales up 8% year-over-year, where growth was led by the U.K., where property values have made more progress towards resetting as well as [indiscernible]. We saw strong growth in our loan origination business despite continued weak property sales activities. \n Our growth was driven by loan origination activity and escrow income. Loan origination fees grew 16%, primarily driven by a heavier weighting of higher-margin loans sourced with debt funds. Escrow income is de minimis in a low interest rate environment, but acts as a hedge in the current economic environment. We saw this in Q1 when escrow income increased nearly threefold from Q1 2023. \n The remaining businesses within Advisory, Property Management, Loan Servicing and Valuations together grew revenue by 5% as expected. For the full year, we expect these businesses to deliver low double-digit revenue growth led by property management, particularly as the Brookfield office assets are on-boarded beginning in Q2. \n Moving to Advisory SOP. I'll call out 2 onetime impacts that weighed on margins in the quarter. First, we experienced elevated medical claims that should reverse later in the year; and second, we trued up interest income owed to a small number of clients. Absent these onetime costs and excluding [indiscernible] margin would have improved 25 basis points versus the prior year Q1. Please turn to Slide 7 as I discuss the GWS segment. \n Net revenue rose 10%, in line with our expectations. Facilities Management and Project Management net revenue were up 11% and 7%, respectively. Project Management faced a particularly difficult comparison as net revenue surged 18% in Q1 2023. We had a second consecutive quarter of very strong business wins with a healthy balance between new clients and expense. \n As of the end of Q1, we already have commitments for nearly $900 million of anticipated net revenue growth, representing the significant majority of our projected growth for the full year. Having already locked in this much of our expected growth gives us confidence in achieving our full year revenue plan. \n SOP margin on net revenue declined by 90 basis points from the prior year Q1. More than half of the decline reflects a onetime impact to gross profit margin from the same unusually large medical claims we saw in Advisory. The remainder is related to 2 areas of higher costs. \n First, we've made investments in certain initiatives that we are discontinuing. Second, our operating expenses have crept up over time as we've expanded into new sectors, entered new geographies and added redundant costs related to recent M&A. In response, we are taking a fresh look at GWS' cost structure and are already executing substantial actions across the business. The benefit of these cost actions, as well as our elevated new business wins, will be apparent in Q3 and particularly Q4. Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of the Real Estate Investments segment. \n This segment's significantly lower earnings were slightly better than we had expected. As we previously discussed, last year's first quarter benefited from an unusually large gain on a development portfolio while project sales activity remained subdued in the current higher cap rate environment. The value of our development in process portfolio increased by $3 billion to $9 billion in total, due to the start of a particularly large fee development project. \n Investment Management performance was in line with expectations and below the prior year, largely due to slightly lower AUM. Fundraising activity was up 50% compared with Q1 2023. Inventors are showing strong appetite for enhanced return and infrastructure strategies, although we expect fundraising to flow from the first quarter's robust levels. Recent fund raising is not yet reflected in AUM, which fell modestly in the quarter to $144 billion, driven by negative market and FX movements. \n Before turning to our outlook, I want to briefly touch on free cash flow. Cash flow conversion has improved for the second consecutive quarter, and we are beginning to see the reversal of incentive compensation headwinds that we experienced last year driven by record earnings in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow this year and end the year with around 1 turn of net leverage. Now please turn to our updated outlook on Slide 9. \n Although interest rate expectations have changed significantly and the economic outlook is more uncertain as Bob noted, we remain confident that we'll earn core EPS in the range of $4.25 and to $4.65 this year. Within Advisory, we continue to expect mid-teens SOP growth unless economic conditions take a sharp turn for the worst. Our base case scenario envisions that the economy remains resilient and interest rate cuts are delayed. Under these conditions, faster leasing growth compensates for subdued sales activities. \n As Bob mentioned, we also still anticipate mid-teens SOP growth for the GWS segment. SOP growth will be very heavily weighted to the second half as recent wins are on-boarded, and we see the impact of our cost-cutting efforts. In REI, we now expect a more pronounced SOP decline, given continued higher interest rates. However, the range of outcomes is better than normal, with the key variable being whether the market for development project sales improved late in the year. \n While REI SOP is unusually depressed right now, we expect these businesses to lead our growth once market conditions inevitably improve. Additionally, as per broad-based efficiency efforts, our COO, Vik Kohli and I are taking a hard look at corporate costs and expect them to be lower for the year than initially anticipated. Assuming the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect to generate nearly 70% of full year core EPS in the second half of the year. This heavy normal weighting reflects the expected cadence of GWS revenue and cost reductions and a slight recovery of our property sales and [indiscernible] businesses later in the year. \n Our expectations for profit growth in 2014 are now driven to a greater degree by the cost components of our business, which are within our control. As such, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our earnings outlook under a range of reasonable economic assumptions. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. \nAnthony Paolone: I guess first question relates to just the guidance at your midpoint and the comments here around 70% in the back half. I guess it implicitly means that 2Q goes down notably. And so I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on that, whether EBITDA also goes down sequentially or if that's an EPS matter? Anything there? \nEmma Giamartino: So Anthony, I do want to walk through the components of our 2024 outlook again. And the headline is that we've -- our -- the midpoint of our outlook is unchanged, but I do want to opt to the components that were -- that built to that outcome. From the Advisory line, you saw our SOP growth trajectory is in line with what we talked about in February. However, the path to get there is slightly different because what we're seeing is that leasing is stronger than we had anticipated because of the health of the economy and sales is weaker as rate cuts have been pushed out. \n On the GWS side. Again, you see that our SOP targets for the year is unchanged. We have consistently talked about the fact that our revenue growth this year in GWS will be back-end loaded as these large lumpy enterprise contracts get on-boarded in the second half of the year. And additionally, what you're seeing is we're going to take out costs from GWS, and so we're going to see margin expansion in the second half of the year. \n On the REI front, we are expecting a slight decline versus last year, and that's to talk about a 10% decline. But what's important to note about REI is that there is a wide range of outcomes. And right now, we're anticipating a large number of monetizations in Q4 within our development business. And as you know, there is uncertainty around when those will hit and if they'll get pushed into 2025 or stay in 2024. \n And then on the corporate segment level. Those costs are coming in lower than we had initially anticipated. So if you put all of that together, you would get to an EPS midpoint that is higher than what we've indicated. But as we said in February, we do have some conservatism embedded in our outlook because of the wide range of outcomes, especially in Advisory and in Development. \n As for Q2, yes, you'll see a decline year-over-year, and that's simply because both in GWS and in Advisory, that revenue growth and that margin expansion is back end -- is second-half loaded. \nAnthony Paolone: So even sequentially, though, does EBITDA kind of move down sequentially from 1Q to 2Q? Today just seems a little bit counter to the normal seasonality. \nEmma Giamartino: No. EBITDA will not be declining from Q1 to Q2. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And should we think about just full year EBITDA margins still being up versus '23 at this point? \nEmma Giamartino: Yes. So EBITDA margin should be up across both Advisory and GWS and at the consolidated level. \nAnthony Paolone: Okay. And then just last one. You mentioned a large development project because you saw the roughly $3 billion balance in Developments underway. But it sounds like that's a fee deals. Just wondering if you can give us a little bit more detail because it's a big increase, and I always looked at that as being something that could drive, promote and your share of gains, but it sounds like maybe there's also like fee projects in there as well where you may not participate. Just maybe some more details there. \nEmma Giamartino: Yes. The significant majority of that increase is related to an extremely large industrial deal in the Sunbelt. It's over 2 million square feet. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. \nSteve Sakwa: I just wanted to touch on capital allocation. Obviously, you had the J&J deal in the first quarter. I noticed you didn't buy back any stock. I guess, first, were you in much of a blackout period, which you didn't really -- weren't allowed to buy back stock? Or was that more of a conscious decision just based on where the stock was? And how should we be thinking about, I guess, stock repurchases going forward as well as capital deployment in the more kind of economic uncertain environment? \nEmma Giamartino: Steve, what you saw in Q1 was related to J&J. We've always talked about we're balancing M&A and share repurchases, and our priority is to deploy capital towards M&A and strategic M&A. And so in Q1, we pulled back on repurchases as we were executing that transaction. We have started repurchasing shares in Q2 to a small extent. And for the balance of the year, you should expect that to continue. As we do more M&A, you'll see that come through. But if we're not seeing a strong conversion of our M&A pipeline, you'll see us repurchase shares as long as our prices remaining attractive. And our goal is, on a consistent basis, to deploy at least our free cash flow on an annual basis. \nSteve Sakwa: Free cash flow in total? \nEmma Giamartino: Yes. \nSteve Sakwa: Okay. But I mean the J&J deal was a large chunk of probably your free cash flow for the year. So that kind of puts limited buyback activities in totality. Is that a fair way to think about it? \nEmma Giamartino: That is fair. \nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then, I guess, Bob, just on the transaction side, it's not the biggest line item, but it probably has more to do with the sentiment around the stock and how people think about the business, even though you certainly diversified the company quite a bit and made it more resilient. I'm just curious, what are you kind of hearing from the field in terms of the transactions and just rates? And is it more about the actual Fed cut? Is it more about stability in the 10-year? I mean, I guess, is it the level of rate? Or is it more of the direction of rate and the uncertainty over that, that creates kind of the pause in the market? \nRobert Sulentic: Steve, first of all, there's 2 areas of our business where it really comes through in our numbers. One is our sales business, one is our development business where we sell assets and generate profits from that. At the beginning of the year, the assumption of our teams was more bullish about the trajectory of interest rates than it is now without a doubt. That shouldn't surprise anybody. I'm sure that's true across the whole market. It's also true of buyers and sellers of assets in general. And as a result, it's just slowed down activity on the sales side. \n And what we're thinking about as a seller of assets in Trammell Crow Company in our development business is exactly what others are thinking about. They've decided to stay on the sidelines longer. We decided to stay on the sidelines longer. We've got a portfolio of great assets that we're going to sell at some point, but we're not going to sell them until we think the environment is such that we can get the pricing we want, and it's hard to get that pricing when interest rates are higher. And that's really what you're seeing. And the sentiment is, in fact, different now than it was at the beginning of the year. Of course, the flip side is it's different because economy is better, and we have this very big leasing business that's benefited from that. \nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then last, I just wanted to clarify. I think you said, I may have missed it, that there was a tax benefit in the in the reported core EPS number this quarter. But I don't know if you sort of quantified it, and I don't recall seeing a specific mention of that in the release. So could you just clarify that, please? \nEmma Giamartino: Correct. It's about a $50 million tax benefit in the quarter that will not repeat. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani at KBW. \nJade Rahmani: Taking a step back. From my vantage point, the big growth opportunities would seem to be infrastructure, investment management and commercial mortgage. Could you comment if you agree with that and where you see the most potential? \nRobert Sulentic: Project management, in general, Jade, is a big, big growth opportunity, project and program management not limited to infrastructure. Corporates are doing a lot of work. There's work in natural resources. That's -- we see that as well into the double digits enduring grower, and it's now become a very big business for us. \n Our whole auction business, our whole GWS business is benefiting from a long-term secular double-digit growth profile, and we expect that to continue. We expect that to continue for our -- what we call our local GWS business and for our enterprise business. So that's going to be a strong grower for us. \n We do think -- if you look at where we're at with our development business and our investment management business, they should be -- Emma commented on this in her remarks. They should lead growth over the next few years just because where the -- those businesses are really at a cyclical low point. \n And if you follow the -- yes, we had a big add to our in-process development through a few which, by the way, that's a deal that Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend are doing together. And before the Turner & Townsend arrangement, we would have been less well positioned to do that, and you should see more of that. \n But that big portfolio of in-process projects for Trammell Crow Company has a lot of pent up profitability. And so you should see a lot of profit growth coming out of that business. And yes, we think our mortgage business is positioned for a lot of growth. So we have confidence right across our business and our ability to grow. And I can tell you, we're going through a deep dive with our strategy team and some outside help. Looking at our strategy, we've got 9 lines of business that we're in. We're the global leader in 6 of them. We're the domestic U.S. leader in development, and we are bullish about growth in all of them, not equally bullish. And I spiked out the ones that we're more bullish about. But we think the growth profile for our business, the enduring growth profile is well into double digits, certainly in the next several years, but longer term as well. \nJade Rahmani: Switching to GWS. The comment around the pipeline, that seems new. So I think investors are trying to [indiscernible] that how to interpret that. Could you give some color as to how much relates to J&J, which I believe was expected to add annual revenue of $825 million. And also just the regular rate double-digit growth that was expected, how much of the $900 million is new business that would be in addition to prior expectations? And then secondly, the medical claims and overall cost controls. If you could provide any color there and why that surprised management? \nEmma Giamartino: Yes. And Jade, on the pipeline comments, can you just give us more on what you're seeing -- or what you're hearing that's different from what we've said previous? \nJade Rahmani: Well, the $900 million that was mentioned, we're trying to understand if that's accretive to prior to our prior expectations. I think in our forecast, we have about $10.2 billion of net revenue, which is [ $1.5 ] million above last year, and that in some new revenue coming in from J&J, which probably would contribute $500 million to $600 million for the year. So stripping that out, trying to compare that to the $900 million and just see how much of that is really new information versus prior. \nEmma Giamartino: Got it. Okay. So that $900 million is not a new information. When we provided our outlook at the beginning of the year for GWS, it was for that $900 million of -- and more of net revenue growth. That was going to come in to GWS in the back half of the year. And that's why we've been talking about the growth accelerating above trend on the revenue line in Q3 and Q4. \n That $900 million does not include J&J. J&J for the year is expected to contribute a little less than $450 million of net revenue. We closed that towards the end of Q1, and it had a very small impact to Q1, given that we had only a month of revenue and profits from J&J. And so that $900 million is simply the conversion of our pipeline. We've talked about really strong conversion and strong pipelines throughout last year and in Q4 and in Q1. So this is articulation of how much is locked in with this confidence that we're going to achieve our revenue forecast for DWS for the year. \n On the cost front, you're right that the majority of the cost impact has been at the gross profit line, and it is related to those employee medical claims coming in higher than we expected. But this is -- we believe this is a seasonality issue or this is a cadence of those claims. I mean it's a unique situation related to the fact that we changed health care providers for our company over a year ago. And over the first year, what typically happens is as employees are looking for new health care providers that are claimed down. And so we knew they were going to tick up this year, we just didn't expect it to happen in Q1. And so that should reverse in the remainder of the year. \nJade Rahmani: That's great. One last one would just be around GWS and office. I often get the question as to when the rationalization in the office sector in terms of reduction in square footage would impact that business. Do you see that as a potential headwind realizing also that there's a lot of growth opportunities, which you've commented on. But just office, in particular, would that be a potential headwind? \nRobert Sulentic: Yes. Jade, it's not a headwind that we haven't contemplated in our comments about expected growth for that business. And I made the comment last quarter that we don't have a single client in GWS that I'm aware of, and we work with the biggest tech companies, the biggest financial companies, et cetera, that doesn't view their office space as a critical asset for the operations of their business. \n They're all trying to get their people together more. They're all trying to get people to spend more time in the office and less time at home. And they're very focused on using those portfolios, those office portfolios to get that done. Yes, most of them are trying to figure out if they can operate with less office space. But to get from more to less office space, they're also thinking about reconfiguring their offices and upgrading their offices and taking different office space. That's why you saw leasing go up. \n A lot of companies are trying to -- particularly in the gateway markets and the better office buildings where we play aggressively, they're trying to put their employees in more attractive space. So there's nothing going on there that would cause us to think that there's a downside dimension that we haven't contemplated already. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Stephen Sheldon of William Blair. \nStephen Sheldon: And just one for me. Great to see the improvement in office leasing. So I just wanted to ask about the other major leasing sector industrial. Are you seeing things there get any better or worse? And what do you think they [indiscernible] for leasing activity to stabilize and return to growth at some point? \nRobert Sulentic: Well, we expect it to grow slightly this year and likely more next year. There's some choppiness in certain coastal markets. But the fact of the matter is some big occupiers are coming back into the market aggressively, some well-known companies. And we aren't of the mind that leasing for the industrial asset class is going to decline this year or next year. We feel good about it. It's not going to have the explosive growth that it had in 2021, et cetera, but it's not going to be a declining leasing business, in our view. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Michael Griffin of Citi. \nMichael Griffin: Great. I wanted to go back to the commentary around office leasing. I think it definitely seems positive relative to what maybe our expectations were. But -- can you unpack that in terms of where you're seeing the leasing gets done? Is it mostly on the Trophy and Class A products? Or is it spread out between the higher quality stuff and then commodity space? \nRobert Sulentic: A lot in the higher-quality assets, Michael. I mean we're seeing record rental rates in some of the bigger markets in the higher-quality assets in New York as an example. We're seeing financial institutions and business services companies, in particular, taking more space. Tech is way down. But for us to have this leasing picture in tech be off the way it is, we view that as good news for us because there is nobody that pays attention to tech that thinks long run. They won't, a, get more of their people back in the office; and b, grow -- be disproportionate growers relative to the rest of the economy. \n So we expect that part of it to come back. And then there are some second-tier markets. They may not be second tier forever, but what's going on in Nashville is pretty well documented. And there are other places that have that flavor to them. So those are the things that are contributing to what we're seeing in office leasing. \nMichael Griffin: Emma, you talked about, I think, the $50 million tax benefit in the quarter. Just in for this, I think it would be about $0.61 of earnings in the quarter. Is that the right run rate and cadence that we should think about to get to the midpoint of the full year guide? Or how should we think about that? \nEmma Giamartino: For the tax rate specifically for the year, it should be about, I think, a little over 19%. Excluding the tax benefit, it's around 22%. Does that answer your question? Or you had specific about... \nMichael Griffin: Yes, yes, yes. No, that does it. And then just one last one. I noticed that you didn't provide the 2025 outlook, I think, relative to last quarter in your presentation. Is the expectation still to return to peak earnings growth in '25 or get close to it? \nEmma Giamartino: Yes. And our -- all of our discussion around the path to reaching peak earnings in 2025 was to provide a framework around how we're thinking about the trajectory of our business. But that path has remained unchanged, and we believe it's achievable where it sits today. And that's driven by continued low double-digit growth across our resilient lines of business at SOP level. And then on the transactional side, the SOP does not need to get back to 2019 levels for us to achieve that record level of EPS next year. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Peter Abramowitz of Jefferies. \nPeter Abramowitz: So most of my questions have been asked, but just one on the transaction markets here. Cushman mentioned on their call, it seemed to be a pretty kind of direct relationship in that investment sales for them, at least, were stronger to begin the first quarter when the rate outlook was much better. And it kind of slowed in March and April as rate expectations have gone up. So just trying to get a sense from what you see in your business in terms of the relationship between rate expectations near term and how things are happening on the ground. Just curious, your comments on kind of what you saw in the business as it directly relates from a rate perspective? \nEmma Giamartino: So it varies across regions in the U.S. That is what we saw later in the quarter. There was an uptick as rates increased. But in EMEA and APAC, we didn't see that trend just given that there is different dynamics going on there and EMEA is ahead of the curve in terms of their recovery in the sales market. \nPeter Abramowitz: Got it. And then one other on the transaction market. Could you just talk generally about kind of the role of distressed sales in the market? Have you seen that kind of start to thaw at all, whether in the first quarter or going forward? \nRobert Sulentic: There's been some distressed debt activity, selling of distressed debt. There's also been some activity, I'd call it more pending activity of selling debt portfolios that aren't distressed just because people's concern about their debt portfolio, may sell non-distressed portfolios at a slight discount. \n The assets that are really distressed are office buildings, B and C office buildings, and there aren't a lot of buyers in the market for those assets right now. We do expect that there will be buyers for those assets in the market, but the pricing probably has to come down more than that. \nOperator: The next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Raymond James. \nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Just one question for me. In your prepared remarks, you spoke to investments in certain initiatives that you are discontinuing. Can you provide some color on what those are and to the extent that they were strategically important to you or not? \nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Patrick, they weren't strategically important. We may have at one time thought they were more strategically important than we do now. In fact, that's almost inevitable given that we were spending money on them and we've stopped. \n But what happens in a business that's growing, and even though our sector and our company have slowed down considerably in the last couple of years, our GWS business hasn't. That business has been growing. And when you have a growing business, you tend to look for opportunities to add initiatives, to address the growth opportunity. You also tend to, because you have a lot of growth opportunity, take your eye off them a little bit when they don't work. And we had -- we built up some of that across GWS. \n The fact of the matter is though, if you look at that business for the quarter, that was a $5.8 billion revenue business. The cost problem that we had net of this medical issue that Emma described is in the $15 million to $20 million range spread across a $5.5 billion-plus business. So it's lots of little things here and there. \n None of our strategically important efforts in that business have changed in any significant way. We have -- I mentioned earlier in my comments, we have a big strategy effort underway with our strategy team now. We're looking at the parts of the business, where we think there is real growth opportunity and where we intend to invest in a big way. And our view of the growth opportunity with enterprise FM customers, with project management for corporates, with project management for green energy and more infrastructure, with our local FM business, none of our broad-based growth aspirations or growth initiatives have been altered as a result of the cost issues that we're after now and what we've been talking about. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan. \nAnthony Paolone: I think you may have just answered this, Bob. I was just going to ask about that sort of the other half of the cost outside of medical that crept up on you in GWS, like kind of what happened there, and just how it changed so quick in like, I guess, the last few months. So I don't know if you had anything else to add on that front. \nRobert Sulentic: Yes, Anthony, I'll add. First of all, I really think to put it in perspective, you got to pay attention to the size of that number relative to the size of that business. Again, it's $15 million to $20 million of costs that hit the bottom line in a negative way relative to what we had expected, if you ignore the medical roughly. Is that right, Emma?\n Okay. And again, that was a $5.5-plus billion business. It's a little bit of cost here and there. But it's something we stay on very closely, and we've taken aggressive action in that business to already address it. We think most of what will need to be done to correct the problems that we saw in that business will be done this quarter. \n And we've also done some rationalization across our whole services business, which resulted in those businesses reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, and elimination of a leadership layer at the CEO level of those businesses, and there'll be other actions consistent with that down through the businesses. \nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Bob Sulentic, Chairman and CEO, for closing comments. \nRobert Sulentic: Thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter with you in about 90 days. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in CBRE. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Emma Giamartino",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. At a consolidated level, core EBITDA was in line with our expectations as slight outperformance in REI and lower-than-expected corporate costs offset margin underperformance in GWS. Advisory SOP performed as anticipated. \n Core [indiscernible] exceeded expectations due to a onetime tax benefit. Please turn to Slide 6 for a review of the Advisory segment. Despite an interest rate outlook that's steadily worsened throughout the quarter, Advisory net revenue rose 3%, consistent with expectations, bolstered by its first quarter of transactional revenue growth in 6 quarters and growth from every line of business except property sales. \n Leasing revenue rose in every region, and global growth exceeded our expectations. Office leasing grew by double digits globally as a resilient economy and progress on return to office plans have been both intended to make occupancy decisions. We have continued to see strong momentum in U.S. leasing in April. \n Financial services companies are leading the recovery with active demand up more than 20% year-over-year of U.S. gateway markets, reflecting their considerable progress in bringing employees back to the office. Tech companies continue to lag with demand 50% below pre-COVID levels. \n Globally, property sales revenue declined 11% with weakness in the U.S. and APAC. EMEA is showing early signs of recovery with sales up 8% year-over-year, where growth was led by the U.K., where property values have made more progress towards resetting as well as [indiscernible]. We saw strong growth in our loan origination business despite continued weak property sales activities. \n Our growth was driven by loan origination activity and escrow income. Loan origination fees grew 16%, primarily driven by a heavier weighting of higher-margin loans sourced with debt funds. Escrow income is de minimis in a low interest rate environment, but acts as a hedge in the current economic environment. We saw this in Q1 when escrow income increased nearly threefold from Q1 2023. \n The remaining businesses within Advisory, Property Management, Loan Servicing and Valuations together grew revenue by 5% as expected. For the full year, we expect these businesses to deliver low double-digit revenue growth led by property management, particularly as the Brookfield office assets are on-boarded beginning in Q2. \n Moving to Advisory SOP. I'll call out 2 onetime impacts that weighed on margins in the quarter. First, we experienced elevated medical claims that should reverse later in the year; and second, we trued up interest income owed to a small number of clients. Absent these onetime costs and excluding [indiscernible] margin would have improved 25 basis points versus the prior year Q1. Please turn to Slide 7 as I discuss the GWS segment. \n Net revenue rose 10%, in line with our expectations. Facilities Management and Project Management net revenue were up 11% and 7%, respectively. Project Management faced a particularly difficult comparison as net revenue surged 18% in Q1 2023. We had a second consecutive quarter of very strong business wins with a healthy balance between new clients and expense. \n As of the end of Q1, we already have commitments for nearly $900 million of anticipated net revenue growth, representing the significant majority of our projected growth for the full year. Having already locked in this much of our expected growth gives us confidence in achieving our full year revenue plan. \n SOP margin on net revenue declined by 90 basis points from the prior year Q1. More than half of the decline reflects a onetime impact to gross profit margin from the same unusually large medical claims we saw in Advisory. The remainder is related to 2 areas of higher costs. \n First, we've made investments in certain initiatives that we are discontinuing. Second, our operating expenses have crept up over time as we've expanded into new sectors, entered new geographies and added redundant costs related to recent M&A. In response, we are taking a fresh look at GWS' cost structure and are already executing substantial actions across the business. The benefit of these cost actions, as well as our elevated new business wins, will be apparent in Q3 and particularly Q4. Please turn to Slide 8 for a discussion of the Real Estate Investments segment. \n This segment's significantly lower earnings were slightly better than we had expected. As we previously discussed, last year's first quarter benefited from an unusually large gain on a development portfolio while project sales activity remained subdued in the current higher cap rate environment. The value of our development in process portfolio increased by $3 billion to $9 billion in total, due to the start of a particularly large fee development project. \n Investment Management performance was in line with expectations and below the prior year, largely due to slightly lower AUM. Fundraising activity was up 50% compared with Q1 2023. Inventors are showing strong appetite for enhanced return and infrastructure strategies, although we expect fundraising to flow from the first quarter's robust levels. Recent fund raising is not yet reflected in AUM, which fell modestly in the quarter to $144 billion, driven by negative market and FX movements. \n Before turning to our outlook, I want to briefly touch on free cash flow. Cash flow conversion has improved for the second consecutive quarter, and we are beginning to see the reversal of incentive compensation headwinds that we experienced last year driven by record earnings in 2022. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow this year and end the year with around 1 turn of net leverage. Now please turn to our updated outlook on Slide 9. \n Although interest rate expectations have changed significantly and the economic outlook is more uncertain as Bob noted, we remain confident that we'll earn core EPS in the range of $4.25 and to $4.65 this year. Within Advisory, we continue to expect mid-teens SOP growth unless economic conditions take a sharp turn for the worst. Our base case scenario envisions that the economy remains resilient and interest rate cuts are delayed. Under these conditions, faster leasing growth compensates for subdued sales activities. \n As Bob mentioned, we also still anticipate mid-teens SOP growth for the GWS segment. SOP growth will be very heavily weighted to the second half as recent wins are on-boarded, and we see the impact of our cost-cutting efforts. In REI, we now expect a more pronounced SOP decline, given continued higher interest rates. However, the range of outcomes is better than normal, with the key variable being whether the market for development project sales improved late in the year. \n While REI SOP is unusually depressed right now, we expect these businesses to lead our growth once market conditions inevitably improve. Additionally, as per broad-based efficiency efforts, our COO, Vik Kohli and I are taking a hard look at corporate costs and expect them to be lower for the year than initially anticipated. Assuming the midpoint of our outlook range, we expect to generate nearly 70% of full year core EPS in the second half of the year. This heavy normal weighting reflects the expected cadence of GWS revenue and cost reductions and a slight recovery of our property sales and [indiscernible] businesses later in the year. \n Our expectations for profit growth in 2014 are now driven to a greater degree by the cost components of our business, which are within our control. As such, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our earnings outlook under a range of reasonable economic assumptions. With that, operator, we'll open the line for questions. So Anthony, I do want to walk through the components of our 2024 outlook again. And the headline is that we've -- our -- the midpoint of our outlook is unchanged, but I do want to opt to the components that were -- that built to that outcome. From the Advisory line, you saw our SOP growth trajectory is in line with what we talked about in February. However, the path to get there is slightly different because what we're seeing is that leasing is stronger than we had anticipated because of the health of the economy and sales is weaker as rate cuts have been pushed out. \n On the GWS side. Again, you see that our SOP targets for the year is unchanged. We have consistently talked about the fact that our revenue growth this year in GWS will be back-end loaded as these large lumpy enterprise contracts get on-boarded in the second half of the year. And additionally, what you're seeing is we're going to take out costs from GWS, and so we're going to see margin expansion in the second half of the year. \n On the REI front, we are expecting a slight decline versus last year, and that's to talk about a 10% decline. But what's important to note about REI is that there is a wide range of outcomes. And right now, we're anticipating a large number of monetizations in Q4 within our development business. And as you know, there is uncertainty around when those will hit and if they'll get pushed into 2025 or stay in 2024. \n And then on the corporate segment level. Those costs are coming in lower than we had initially anticipated. So if you put all of that together, you would get to an EPS midpoint that is higher than what we've indicated. But as we said in February, we do have some conservatism embedded in our outlook because of the wide range of outcomes, especially in Advisory and in Development. \n As for Q2, yes, you'll see a decline year-over-year, and that's simply because both in GWS and in Advisory, that revenue growth and that margin expansion is back end -- is second-half loaded. No. EBITDA will not be declining from Q1 to Q2. Yes. So EBITDA margin should be up across both Advisory and GWS and at the consolidated level. Yes. The significant majority of that increase is related to an extremely large industrial deal in the Sunbelt. It's over 2 million square feet. Steve, what you saw in Q1 was related to J&J. We've always talked about we're balancing M&A and share repurchases, and our priority is to deploy capital towards M&A and strategic M&A. And so in Q1, we pulled back on repurchases as we were executing that transaction. We have started repurchasing shares in Q2 to a small extent. And for the balance of the year, you should expect that to continue. As we do more M&A, you'll see that come through. But if we're not seeing a strong conversion of our M&A pipeline, you'll see us repurchase shares as long as our prices remaining attractive. And our goal is, on a consistent basis, to deploy at least our free cash flow on an annual basis. Yes. That is fair. Correct. It's about a $50 million tax benefit in the quarter that will not repeat. Yes. And Jade, on the pipeline comments, can you just give us more on what you're seeing -- or what you're hearing that's different from what we've said previous? Got it. Okay. So that $900 million is not a new information. When we provided our outlook at the beginning of the year for GWS, it was for that $900 million of -- and more of net revenue growth. That was going to come in to GWS in the back half of the year. And that's why we've been talking about the growth accelerating above trend on the revenue line in Q3 and Q4. \n That $900 million does not include J&J. J&J for the year is expected to contribute a little less than $450 million of net revenue. We closed that towards the end of Q1, and it had a very small impact to Q1, given that we had only a month of revenue and profits from J&J. And so that $900 million is simply the conversion of our pipeline. We've talked about really strong conversion and strong pipelines throughout last year and in Q4 and in Q1. So this is articulation of how much is locked in with this confidence that we're going to achieve our revenue forecast for DWS for the year. \n On the cost front, you're right that the majority of the cost impact has been at the gross profit line, and it is related to those employee medical claims coming in higher than we expected. But this is -- we believe this is a seasonality issue or this is a cadence of those claims. I mean it's a unique situation related to the fact that we changed health care providers for our company over a year ago. And over the first year, what typically happens is as employees are looking for new health care providers that are claimed down. And so we knew they were going to tick up this year, we just didn't expect it to happen in Q1. And so that should reverse in the remainder of the year. For the tax rate specifically for the year, it should be about, I think, a little over 19%. Excluding the tax benefit, it's around 22%. Does that answer your question? Or you had specific about... Yes. And our -- all of our discussion around the path to reaching peak earnings in 2025 was to provide a framework around how we're thinking about the trajectory of our business. But that path has remained unchanged, and we believe it's achievable where it sits today. And that's driven by continued low double-digit growth across our resilient lines of business at SOP level. And then on the transactional side, the SOP does not need to get back to 2019 levels for us to achieve that record level of EPS next year. So it varies across regions in the U.S. That is what we saw later in the quarter. There was an uptick as rates increased. But in EMEA and APAC, we didn't see that trend just given that there is different dynamics going on there and EMEA is ahead of the curve in terms of their recovery in the sales market."

            "name": "Robert Sulentic",
            "content": "Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, it's important to note that Emma and I regularly reference our performance relative to expectations during these quarterly calls. In office, the expectations we are referencing are based on the outlook we provided during our most recent quarterly call. \n We started 2024 by delivering core earnings that exceeded our expectations. This was driven in part by solid net revenue growth. However, several notable elements of our performance differed from our time going into the year. I'll touch on 3 of them: leasing strength, property sales weakness and cost pressure. \n Leasing outperformed expectations, driven by office leasing growth globally, that reflects a resilient economy and companies making progress on bringing their employees back to the office. At the same time, persistent inflation kept interest rates higher than expected, which led to underperformance in our property sale transaction activity. \n Our Global Workplace Solutions segment again delivered double-digit net revenue growth even as margins fell short of expectations. Our costs in GWS have increased at an unacceptable rate, and we have initiated actions to bring them quickly back into line with revenue trajectory. These actions include consolidating the management of advisory and GWS under our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, with an explicit focus on rapidly ringing out unnecessary costs and better integrating the solutions we deliver for occupier clients. Significant progress has already been made on these efforts. \n We expect GWS' cost challenges to be mostly mitigated by year-end with the majority of our actions being initiated in the second quarter. As a result, this segment remains poised to achieve mid-teens SOP growth for the full year. Looking across the whole business. We remain confident that we will generate core earnings per share in the range of $4.25 to $4.65. Our confidence is underpinned by our resilient business' continued strong performance, our rapid actions on costs and the fact that advisory services remains on track to achieve its growth target for the year despite a more uncertain economic outlook. Emma will discuss the specifics of our outlook in greater detail after reviewing our first quarter performance. Emma? Steve, first of all, there's 2 areas of our business where it really comes through in our numbers. One is our sales business, one is our development business where we sell assets and generate profits from that. At the beginning of the year, the assumption of our teams was more bullish about the trajectory of interest rates than it is now without a doubt. That shouldn't surprise anybody. I'm sure that's true across the whole market. It's also true of buyers and sellers of assets in general. And as a result, it's just slowed down activity on the sales side. \n And what we're thinking about as a seller of assets in Trammell Crow Company in our development business is exactly what others are thinking about. They've decided to stay on the sidelines longer. We decided to stay on the sidelines longer. We've got a portfolio of great assets that we're going to sell at some point, but we're not going to sell them until we think the environment is such that we can get the pricing we want, and it's hard to get that pricing when interest rates are higher. And that's really what you're seeing. And the sentiment is, in fact, different now than it was at the beginning of the year. Of course, the flip side is it's different because economy is better, and we have this very big leasing business that's benefited from that. Project management, in general, Jade, is a big, big growth opportunity, project and program management not limited to infrastructure. Corporates are doing a lot of work. There's work in natural resources. That's -- we see that as well into the double digits enduring grower, and it's now become a very big business for us. \n Our whole auction business, our whole GWS business is benefiting from a long-term secular double-digit growth profile, and we expect that to continue. We expect that to continue for our -- what we call our local GWS business and for our enterprise business. So that's going to be a strong grower for us. \n We do think -- if you look at where we're at with our development business and our investment management business, they should be -- Emma commented on this in her remarks. They should lead growth over the next few years just because where the -- those businesses are really at a cyclical low point. \n And if you follow the -- yes, we had a big add to our in-process development through a few which, by the way, that's a deal that Trammell Crow Company and Turner & Townsend are doing together. And before the Turner & Townsend arrangement, we would have been less well positioned to do that, and you should see more of that. \n But that big portfolio of in-process projects for Trammell Crow Company has a lot of pent up profitability. And so you should see a lot of profit growth coming out of that business. And yes, we think our mortgage business is positioned for a lot of growth. So we have confidence right across our business and our ability to grow. And I can tell you, we're going through a deep dive with our strategy team and some outside help. Looking at our strategy, we've got 9 lines of business that we're in. We're the global leader in 6 of them. We're the domestic U.S. leader in development, and we are bullish about growth in all of them, not equally bullish. And I spiked out the ones that we're more bullish about. But we think the growth profile for our business, the enduring growth profile is well into double digits, certainly in the next several years, but longer term as well. Yes. Jade, it's not a headwind that we haven't contemplated in our comments about expected growth for that business. And I made the comment last quarter that we don't have a single client in GWS that I'm aware of, and we work with the biggest tech companies, the biggest financial companies, et cetera, that doesn't view their office space as a critical asset for the operations of their business. \n They're all trying to get their people together more. They're all trying to get people to spend more time in the office and less time at home. And they're very focused on using those portfolios, those office portfolios to get that done. Yes, most of them are trying to figure out if they can operate with less office space. But to get from more to less office space, they're also thinking about reconfiguring their offices and upgrading their offices and taking different office space. That's why you saw leasing go up. \n A lot of companies are trying to -- particularly in the gateway markets and the better office buildings where we play aggressively, they're trying to put their employees in more attractive space. So there's nothing going on there that would cause us to think that there's a downside dimension that we haven't contemplated already. Well, we expect it to grow slightly this year and likely more next year. There's some choppiness in certain coastal markets. But the fact of the matter is some big occupiers are coming back into the market aggressively, some well-known companies. And we aren't of the mind that leasing for the industrial asset class is going to decline this year or next year. We feel good about it. It's not going to have the explosive growth that it had in 2021, et cetera, but it's not going to be a declining leasing business, in our view. A lot in the higher-quality assets, Michael. I mean we're seeing record rental rates in some of the bigger markets in the higher-quality assets in New York as an example. We're seeing financial institutions and business services companies, in particular, taking more space. Tech is way down. But for us to have this leasing picture in tech be off the way it is, we view that as good news for us because there is nobody that pays attention to tech that thinks long run. They won't, a, get more of their people back in the office; and b, grow -- be disproportionate growers relative to the rest of the economy. \n So we expect that part of it to come back. And then there are some second-tier markets. They may not be second tier forever, but what's going on in Nashville is pretty well documented. And there are other places that have that flavor to them. So those are the things that are contributing to what we're seeing in office leasing. There's been some distressed debt activity, selling of distressed debt. There's also been some activity, I'd call it more pending activity of selling debt portfolios that aren't distressed just because people's concern about their debt portfolio, may sell non-distressed portfolios at a slight discount. \n The assets that are really distressed are office buildings, B and C office buildings, and there aren't a lot of buyers in the market for those assets right now. We do expect that there will be buyers for those assets in the market, but the pricing probably has to come down more than that. Yes, Patrick, they weren't strategically important. We may have at one time thought they were more strategically important than we do now. In fact, that's almost inevitable given that we were spending money on them and we've stopped. \n But what happens in a business that's growing, and even though our sector and our company have slowed down considerably in the last couple of years, our GWS business hasn't. That business has been growing. And when you have a growing business, you tend to look for opportunities to add initiatives, to address the growth opportunity. You also tend to, because you have a lot of growth opportunity, take your eye off them a little bit when they don't work. And we had -- we built up some of that across GWS. \n The fact of the matter is though, if you look at that business for the quarter, that was a $5.8 billion revenue business. The cost problem that we had net of this medical issue that Emma described is in the $15 million to $20 million range spread across a $5.5 billion-plus business. So it's lots of little things here and there. \n None of our strategically important efforts in that business have changed in any significant way. We have -- I mentioned earlier in my comments, we have a big strategy effort underway with our strategy team now. We're looking at the parts of the business, where we think there is real growth opportunity and where we intend to invest in a big way. And our view of the growth opportunity with enterprise FM customers, with project management for corporates, with project management for green energy and more infrastructure, with our local FM business, none of our broad-based growth aspirations or growth initiatives have been altered as a result of the cost issues that we're after now and what we've been talking about. Yes, Anthony, I'll add. First of all, I really think to put it in perspective, you got to pay attention to the size of that number relative to the size of that business. Again, it's $15 million to $20 million of costs that hit the bottom line in a negative way relative to what we had expected, if you ignore the medical roughly. Is that right, Emma?\n Okay. And again, that was a $5.5-plus billion business. It's a little bit of cost here and there. But it's something we stay on very closely, and we've taken aggressive action in that business to already address it. We think most of what will need to be done to correct the problems that we saw in that business will be done this quarter. \n And we've also done some rationalization across our whole services business, which resulted in those businesses reporting to our Chief Operating Officer, Vikram Kohli, and elimination of a leadership layer at the CEO level of those businesses, and there'll be other actions consistent with that down through the businesses. Thanks, everyone, for being with us, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter with you in about 90 days."
