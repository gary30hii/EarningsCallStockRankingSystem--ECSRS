[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning and welcome to ITW's Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we'll discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results and provide guidance for full-year 2021. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Company's 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. From my perspective, the highlights are the Q4 revenues got back to year-ago levels despite food equipment being down 17% and net operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 records for the company. It was a pretty solid finish to the year that needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges, and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021. While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built and honed over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did. Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we refocused the entire company on only two core imperatives. A, to protect the health, safety and well-being of our people, and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence. And in my view, we executed extremely well on both. Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in support of these two key pandemic priorities. Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring and there is no question that we differentiate ourselves with many of our key customers, as a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts. We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we've thought through, how we should manage the company through the pandemic. Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress-tested the Company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past eight years have resulted in a very strong and very resilient company. And as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down. And for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long-term. This conclusion led to two key decisions that we made regarding how we're going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis. First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last eight years to reinforce our commitment to our people. First, by providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe. And by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprise-wide employment reduction mandates or programs at any point in 2020. These were not obvious or easy decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances but we believe that they were the right decisions for our company. And I know that our people will remember them. These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3. Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our Win the Recovery agenda and mindset across the Company. Win the Recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy. What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic. Win the Recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic. As across the company, we had to read and react to the realities of the near-term situation as we always do but it does mean that we are committed to protecting key investment supporting the execution of our long-term strategy and that we have from very early on, given our divisional leadership teams to mandate to continue to think long-term and to remain aggressive through the pandemic. For 2021, our Win the Recovery posture and mindset continues on and serves as the central theme driving the 2021operating plans for every one of our 83 divisions. Before I turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q4 performance and our 2021 guidance, let me close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional performance and dedication in the face of the most challenging and unprecedented circumstances of the past year. The performance that they delivered in 2020 provides another proof point that ITW as a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, resilience and agility necessary to deliver consistent top tier performance in any environment. Like many of you, I'm sure we are hopeful for a return to somewhere in the vicinity of normal at some point in 2021 and with that getting back to giving our full attention to taking ITW all the way for the company's full potential. Between now and whenever that is, we will continue to leverage the full breadth of ITW's capabilities and competitive advantages to keep our people safe, continue to serve our customers with excellence and execute our long-term enterprise strategy. Michael, over to you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see solid recovery progress in many of the end markets that we serve as evidenced by our revenue being up sequentially 5% versus the third quarter. The increase is 8% when you adjust for equal number of days when historically our revenue per day has increased by 1% from Q3 to Q4. Overall, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, operating income of $883 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year, operating margin of 24.4%, free cash flow of $705 million, and GAAP EPS of $2.02. After-tax return on invested capital improved to 32%. And as Scott mentioned, operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were fourth quarter records for the company. Revenue in all major geographies improved sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, North America organic revenue declined 3%, International revenue grew 1%, Europe was down 2%. Similar to Q3, China was the bright spot with 11% growth. As we've talked about before, the operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system also applies to the cost structure, which was on full display through our operating margin performance in Q4. We improved operating margin by 170 basis points to 25.4%, the second-highest margin rate in a quarter in the history of the company. And like I say, grew operating income 7% to $883 million, the highest fourth quarter ever. The biggest driver of our margin improvement remains our enterprise initiatives, as the ITW team executed on projects and activities that contributed 130 basis points in Q4. The impact was broad-based with all segments delivering enterprise initiatives benefits in the range of 80 to 170 basis points. GAAP EPS was $2.02, up 2%, but keep in mind, the Q4 last year had $0.11of one-time gains from divestitures. If you exclude those gains, EPS was up 7%, the same as operating income. Working capital performance was excellent and free cash flow of $705 million was solid with a conversion rate of 110% of net income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 22.1%, down slightly from last year. In summary, a strong finish to a challenging year and very good momentum as we head into 2021. Let's move to Slide 5 to review fourth quarter's recovery and response by segment. We updated this slide from our last earnings call with Q4 information and you can see that our segments continue to respond effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenue and operating margin. I would just highlight a few things to illustrate the resilience and adaptability of our businesses. You can see the rapid recovery in our end markets, relative to the Q2 bottom, but down 27%. In Q4, three of our segments experienced demand levels that were higher than a year ago. The most pronounced recovery has been in automotive OEM, which is more than doubled since Q2 and grew 8% year-over-year in Q4, as did construction products. Polymers and Fluids grew 7% while demand in three segments, Test & Measurement and electronics, welding and specialty products was only slightly lower year-over-year. As you would expect food equipment continues to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we are seeing some sequential improvement. Overall, you can see the benefit of having a high quality diversified portfolio and the fact that we're back to demand levels of a year ago with total revenue essentially flat year-over-year despite one of our core segments being down organically by 19%. On the right side of the page, you can see the operating flexibility that I just talked about and how to also apply to our cost structure and ultimately shows up in our operating margin performance. At the bottom, in Q2, we still delivered solid operating margins of 17.5% and only two segments were below 20%. In Q4, were almost 800 basis points higher at 25.4% despite no volume growth year-over-year and every segment is back about 22% including Food Equipment and six out of seven segments achieved record fourth quarter operating margins. Let's move on to Slide 6 for a closer look at individual segment performance, starting with automotive OEM. The team has continued to execute exceptionally well from a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to customer demand levels that have more than doubled since Q2. In Q4, organic growth of 8% year-over-year was the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2017. While North America was flat in Q2, it was more than offset by strong demand in Europe, which grew 10% and China, which grew 20%. As expected, food equipment end markets remained challenged in Q4, organic revenue was down 19%, a little better than the third quarter, and demand in Q4 was similar to Q3 when you look at it by geography and the end markets. North America was down 20%, international down 18%, equipment sales were down 20% and service was down 18%. Institutional demand was down about 30% with restaurants down a little bit more than that. And not surprisingly, the bright spot throughout the year, continue to be retail with organic growth of 8%. Moving to Slide 7 for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Q4 organic revenue declined 3% with Test & Measurement down 8% against the tough comparison of plus 6% in Q4 '19. Electronics was up 3% and while demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, the segment benefited from considerable strength in several end-markets, including semiconductor, healthcare and clean room. As you may have seen on January 19, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Amphenol to acquire MTS's Test & Simulation Business. The Test & Simulation Business is very complementary to our Instron business, which we highlighted during our 2018 Investor Day and some of you may have visited our facility outside of Boston. MTS's Test & Simulation business has similar organic growth potential and there is substantial opportunity for margin improvement through the application of the ITW business model. Pre-COVID revenues in fiscal year 2019 were $559 million with operating margin of 6%. We expect to get the business to generate ITW caliber operating margins by the end of year five and generate after-tax ROIC in the high teens by the end of year 10. As you saw in the announcement, we expect the acquisition to close in the middle of 2021 and we're very much looking forward to welcoming the MTS Test & Simulation team to the ITW family. Moving on, please turn to Slide 8. In welding, where we saw a meaningful pickup in demand as organic revenue improved from being down 10% year-over-year in Q3 to only being down 2% in Q4. Our commercial business which primarily serves smaller businesses and individual users and accounts for 35% of the revenue in this segment remained strong and grew 12% year-over-year. Our Industrial business showed signs of strong recovery from being down 23% in Q3 to down only 5% in Q4 as customer activity and equipment orders gained strength. Overall organic revenue food equipment was flat versus prior year and much improved versus a 10% decline in the third quarter. Polymers & Fluids delivered strong organic growth of 7% with fluids up 16% with continued strong demand in end-markets related to healthcare and hygiene. The automotive aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales with organic growth of 5% and polymers grew 4% with solid demand for MRO and automotive applications. Moving to Slide 9. Construction continues to benefit from strong demand in the home center channel and delivered organic growth of 8% in Q4. Growth was strong across all geographies with North America up 10%, double-digit growth in the residential renovation market offset by commercial construction, which represents only about 15% of North America revenue down 11%. Europe grew 9% and Australia/New Zealand grew 5% due to strong retail sales. Specialty organic revenue was down 3% this quarter with North America down 2% and international revenue down 4%. Demand for consumer packaging remains solid, but it was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses. So that concludes the segment commentary and let's move on to the full year 2020 summer results in Slide 10. And in the face of unprecedented challenges that included temporary customer shutdowns across wide swaths of our end markets during the year, organic revenue was down 10%. Still we delivered operating income of $2.9 billion and highly resilient operating margin of 22.9%, only down 120 basis points year-over-year despite no major cost takeout initiatives on mandates, and with the strong contribution of 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. After-tax ROIC was 26.2% and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Throughout the pandemic, one of our priorities was to maintain our financial strength, liquidity, and strategic optionality, and as you can see, we did just that in 2020. ITW's balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity. We did not have a need to issue any debt or commercial paper in 2020 and we ended the year with total debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.5 times, which is only slightly above our 2.25 times target. At year-end, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. With 2020 behind us, let's move to Slide 11 for a discussion of our guidance for 2021. So starting with the caveat that we continue to operate in a fairly uncertain economic environment, we have based our guidance as we always do on the current levels of demand in our businesses. Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level. Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and has 2 percentage points revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%. At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint. We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. Enterprise Initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021, as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year. We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment and embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals. Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis. We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income. I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021. Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses. Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third priority, our selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential. I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only. After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021. In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021. We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year. And instead, focus on our time and efforts on the recovery in 2021. While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given their expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022. Let's turn to Slide 12 and the forecast for organic growth by segment. With the caveat again and the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment and based on current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021. At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%. To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong, as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we've built over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper-tier performance in any environment. Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year and our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. With that Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Michael. And Julianne, let's open up the lines for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good execution as usual. So it's been a couple of years now since your last Analyst Day, so maybe you could update us and you are in terms of the goal of finishing the job related to enterprise strategy. It seems like your performance in the second half of '20 and the 7% to 10% growth guidance you've got for '21 is reflecting full organic growth potential versus your end markets. But maybe give us some color around that and how you're thinking about enterprise strategy coming out of the pandemic? Do you still see 100 basis points of margin improvement per year through at least 2023?\nScott Santi: Well, I'd say a couple of things, Andy. First of all, this has been a process throughout the entire journey where the sort of further we go with that, the more opportunity we find to continue to improve. And I think one of the remarkable things from our perspective is eight years into this, I don't see that slowing up any. And so we are focused on continuing to move forward to get better every year, get a little bit better this year than we were last year. Within the framework of this, the strategy that we've laid out and I think there remains ample room to continue on that path for a number of years. We also have some performance goals out there. You're right, it's been a couple of years, but two years ago, it's when we update those goals, and we remain absolutely on track and committed to delivering on those goals. And as we get closer to that, we'll figure out what the next step is - steps are.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks for that, Scott. And then is it right to think that generally, you should see more margin improvement from the segment with the largest growth projections for '21? And could you give us, I know you talked, Michael, I know you talked about price versus cost, you sometimes have sort of these lags in some of the segments like auto OEM, do we get concerned about that at all? And any other color on [prices cost] [ph] you could give us?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I'd say, Andy, we - based on our bottoms-up planning process, we expect every segment to improve on their margin performance in 2021, as Scott said, a little bit better every year as we march towards our full potential. I think one of the remarkable things, when you look at the margin performance by segment is how the range has narrowed and we're - as we sit here today, the low-end is food equipment at 22% and the high-end is welding at 29%, very different range from when we started this strategy eight years ago. And I think the fact that we have businesses, delivery margins in the high 20s just gives us further confidence in the long-term goals that we've laid out for the company. So the big driver in 2021 remains Enterprise Initiatives. Those are broad-based in every segment will make progress on 80/20 and Strategic Sourcing, and certainly, we expect that also a meaningful contribution from volume leverage as we go through the year here. But I wouldn't single any segment out as having more margin improvement potential than others. I think we expect all of our segments to continue to make progress towards their full potential.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, guys.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, Andy, and I can give you a little bit on price costs. So certainly, like I said, we are closely monitoring the raw material cost environment, we are seeing inflationary pressures in commodities such as steel, resins, certain chemicals, by segments, automotive, construction, and polymers and fluids is probably where we're seeing the more significant increases. In all of our segments, the plan is to offset those cost increases, the ones that we know about and the ones that may arise this year with price on a dollar for dollar basis. As you know, in automotive, just given the nature of the industry that is a process that takes a little bit longer, but we're confident that over time, we're going to be able to offset any raw material cost increases with price, just given the differentiated nature of our product offerings in each one of these segments, so.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNicole DeBlase: Can we just start with the outlook for auto OEM? When you think about the 14% to 18% that you forecasted for 2021, how does that look in the context of some of these semiconductor supply chain issues that we're seeing? And I guess are some of those hiccups embedded in your outlook? And with that said, if you could talk maybe a little bit about the potential quarterly cadence for the auto business, I know you guys don't give quarterly guidance, but in this case, it could be kind of a weird year.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So thank you, Nicole. I...\nScott Santi: I can tell you one thing on the quarterly cadence that Q2 is going to be a lot better this year than with last year. That's the one thing I know for sure. I agree with that.\nMichael Larsen: So just on the - there's a lot of talk about the shortage of semiconductor in the automotive OEM space. What I can tell you is, and this is true across all of our businesses, we've not seen a slowdown in demand and strong momentum going into the year, certainly carried through January. It is possible, though, that we may see some production slowdown here in Q1 at some of our customers, whether that will impact the demand, their demand for our products, I think remains to be seen. We view this right now as more of a timing issue and so certainly, this could put a little bit of pressure on the auto business here in the first quarter. But as we sit here today, we would assume that we're going to catch that up in Q2 or the second half of the year. In terms of the quarterly cadence for the auto business. I think you saw the strong performance here in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Like I said, we've not seen anything to suggest that that demand is slowing down while we're looking at the January results. So we expect, given how we've planned the business to be off to a pretty good start with positive organic growth and margin improvement in the first quarter that typically sequentially that builds as we go through the year. Q2 will be, as Scott said, the biggest quarter and the second half, the comps start to get a little bit more challenging, the build numbers are a little bit different but that's probably as much as I can give you on the automotive business and kind of how this might play out by quarter.\nNicole DeBlase: No, thanks. That was actually super helpful. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, when you think about the guidance that you put together for just the full company organic growth in 2021, thinking back to last year when you guys were really talking about opportunities to outgrow as we move into recovery mode, have you factored in some of that margin improvement into - sorry, market and market share improvement over peers into the 2021 guidance?\nScott Santi: Well, I - the only way that it's - that's factored in at this point is, it's embedded in the impact of those efforts have already made in our current run rates. So we are not baking in any further acceleration, it doesn't mean that we don't have a lot of intention around continuing to as we've talked about before, be aggressive as the recovery continues to accelerate, but from the standpoint of our normal planning practice, we are - what's embedded in our organic growth forecast is exactly what Michael said earlier, the current run rates - daily run rates projected through full-year 2021 with whatever the normal sort of seasonal impacts are quarter-by-quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Two questions. One, kind of following up on that last thread, fully understand your methodologies here kind of this rolling forward current trajectory. But when you look at the segments, are there one or two kind of either way positive or negative that, I know your astute business sense and long history with these businesses would suggest are likely to be potentially better or worse than kind of the exit rate here as we exit 2020?\nMichael Larsen A - Michael Larsen: Well, I'm trying to think about that question. The obvious one to point to is food equipment that depending on sort of pace of vaccine penetration and recovery. That's obviously, where even at that 8% to 12% growth rate for the year, we're well below 2019 levels of demand let alone incremental growth opportunities we have. So that from the standpoint of the one with the most outside leverage that's clearly the case. I don't know that there is anything else that I would say would really stand out, I think the capital equipment business, as you would expect, so welding and test and measurement, that as businesses get more comfortable with both the pace and trajectory and sustainability of the recovery that their comfort level with investment would - and our confidence in the future would certainly stimulate more, perhaps more demand in those sectors, maybe as I think about your question, but I think that would be the two areas that, should things continue on in the positive direction, they are the significant benefit from continued broad-based - the broad-based momentum that we're seeing.\nJeff Sprague: And also thinking about kind of cyclical versus structural growth, Scott. Right. So the effort to kind of pivot the businesses, the whole ready to grow, but not growing, and the ones that we're outgrowing, do you think there will be measurable outgrowth across most of the portfolio? So like you said, we don't know quite what the world is going to hand us in 2021, but I just wonder your confidence and visibility on our growth, you mentioned new products and food equipment for example, I'm sure there are things in other segments. Maybe you could just provide a little additional color there.\nScott Santi: Yes, I think that's where the proof is got to be in the project and that's what we've been working on. And so I, certainly in 2020 and '21, I think to try to get any sense of sort of what the market baselines are given the - just the overall volatility in all the, let's say the corresponding supply chain impacts on demand and inventory levels and all that stuff, it's really, it's almost possible to tell, but I would absolutely expect that our ability to stay focused and aggressive on the growth agenda through all of this, I won't say a better payoff but I'd say it's payoff is what we're all about. That's what we've been doing all this stuff for. So I won't tell you that every one of our 83 divisions are all the way there, but I guarantee you that I can say that 90% of them are in great position, are doing all the right things, have stayed focused and have stayed aggressive through this, we're not in that, we're not using the ready to grow and not growing categories anymore. I'll put it that way. It's - I think we're well past that point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAnn Duignan: Maybe you could talk a little bit about your outlook for construction products that might have expected organic growth to have been up a little bit more in 2021 but perhaps it's just on the back of strong renovation in 2020, but just some color there in terms of regional and sub-sectors, that would be helpful.\nScott Santi: That's exactly what I told our EVP, Ann. Just so you know. So what I'd tell you, Ann is that obviously, a strong year for the construction business and finishing Q4, up 8% on a year-over-year basis, a lot of strength in the home centers that we've talked about really since the beginning of the pandemic, and we expect that to be just given the comps that the growth in the home centers would be in the low single-digits. We - there are some encouraging signs around housing starts. And then we have a great portfolio of highly differentiated products. So you put all of that together, I think our view is we should be able to grow in the mid to high single-digits here in 2021. And as I said, we're off to a good start here in January, so.\nAnn Duignan: And any differentiation regionally that you'd like to comment on?\nMichael Larsen: No, I think it's pretty - I think the comps are a little bit easier in Europe, maybe in North America but we, really on a global basis, we had a good year. But, so that's really all that I would point to.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. And then as my follow-up perhaps, similar question on welding, just different customer bases and maybe different regions, what you\u2019re seeing - I will hand it over.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So I think welding, strong finish to the year good momentum going into 2021 and I'd say a pretty solid outlook for all end markets, maybe with the exception of the oil and gas piece, which is somewhere in the 15% to 20%, it's probably closer to 15% of total revenues that is expected to remain soft as we go through the year. But the commercial business has been strong all year and no signs of that slowing down the industrial side. So this is what Scott talked about with CapEx may be picking up as this recovery path is a little clearer. We're expecting a solid year in the welding business with again continued progress on the margin side, despite the fact that they put up almost 29% here in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: And your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJohn Inch: Picking up on a couple of the themes of the past few questions. Do any of the businesses, Scott and Michael, stand out based on call it internal changes, they may have pursued in 2020 that position them in your minds really favorably for 2021 and this could be everything from, I don't know, like acceleration of enterprise initiatives, new products line up that they've got ready to kind of tee up here, maybe new customer sort of supply line or existing new customer channel initiatives or anything like that that you might call out?\nScott Santi: Yes, I can't really think of anything, particularly given the environment we're in, other than point to what we've been talking about throughout, which is we stayed focused on implementing those, the relevant changes, strategic changes business by business along the lines of what you're talking about throughout this entire - throughout the entirety of 2020. So I think if anything, the most significant part of what we accomplished in '20 is we stayed ready, we stayed prepared, we stayed in position and we kept moving the ball. And so I don't know that there is any big shifts that I can point to as much as the fact that we stayed in there and kept moving forward while dealing with the pretty unusual set of near-term circumstances and I expect that that will pay significant dividends, particularly if the rate of recovery continues on as we're seeing right now.\nJohn Inch: Well, Scott, how significant as we think in the next couple of years in recovery, are new products or the introduction of new products going to play in terms of the drive to faster growth? Like was this an opportunity? I mean we don't have a view inside the company, right? So, was this an opportunity for yes to do realignment cost-cutting and so forth up to the centralized level, but for the folks to basically say, you know what, let's push on this initiative for that initiative or launch that as part of kind of your overall emphasis to take share which was stated kind of going on?\nScott Santi: Yes, relative. New products are core - it's a core I want to - of our business model, customer back innovation we have been - there has been no change in terms of the central nature of that as our strategy. We're banging out a couple of thousand patents a year. Year in, year out, that certainly continued on in 2020 as it always has. So I don't know that there has been any inflection or change in terms of our posture there. It is, in my view, it's the only way we outgrow our markets over the long haul. We're going to get some penetration from our service capabilities from our ability to attract new customers, but in the end, innovation, new products, new technologies, or existing products is the key and core driver ultimately of our, I believe they outgrow our markets consistently over time. That's not a new concept here.\nMichael Larsen: And I would just add financially speaking, John, our internal investments, new product, our top priority from a capital allocation standpoint, then if you look at our new product investment in 2020, it was the same number as in 2019 as we stayed invested in these projects and strategies to drive above market organic growth. Historically, we've achieved about a percentage point of organic growth every year for new products and that's kind of we're counting on in every segment as we move forward.\nJohn Inch: Makes sense. If I could just sneak in one more. You return to M&A, the two obvious challenging verticals have been commercial aerospace, and oil and gas. Are there, like - are you guys perhaps thinking you guys are contrarian thinkers? Are these possibly going to present opportunities for M&A? Like would you consider an aerospace deal? And in terms of oil and gas, would that be off-limits just because of ESG considerations, which you obviously don't have today?\nScott Santi: Yes. I just go back to our, basically two criteria. One is that we - It has to - we have to - if we're going to make that kind of an investment in terms of not just to our capital, but our time, effort and energy, it has to be in something that we have a lot of conviction about that can support or further accelerate the company's long-term growth potential. And we have to also have significant potential for margin improvement from 80/20. If you look at MTS and that absolutely checks both of those boxes. So I don't - we don't have anything that in my view as off-limits, if those criteria are met and I'll just leave it at that. I am not good at that, but I will also say, as more we\u2019re leaning in super harder on one particular sector or another. I think as we've talked about before, we have demonstrated ability to perform and execute across seven businesses today. So ultimately, it's much more a function of the individual characteristics of the asset that we're talking about than it is any sort of outside-in view of, we want to - we need to get growth year or play for a certain theory about long-term end-market growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJamie Cook: I guess just two follow-ups. One, I know you talked about sort of supply chain and as it relates to the automotive sector. I guess one, do you have anything in your guidance embedded for supply chain, potentially higher freight costs or whatever that's - you're managing for? And I guess my second question, when you first laid out your strategy in 2020 to go after market share during COVID, you talked about potentially your competitors having issue, there is demand, ramps or even managing through the downturn. Can you talk about whether some of the supply chain issues are impacting your competitors and whether it's sort of in line with what you thought greater than what you would thought? I'm just trying to size that potential opportunity. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, so, Jamie, on your first question, we are seeing an increase in freight cost. It is not one of the largest, categories when we look at where we're seeing cost pressure, but it is any known increases in terms of freight and logistics are embedded in our plan, in our guidance here today. I think in terms of market share, as a result of being able to maintain delivery and quality, if we were to talk to our segments, they would all be able to come up with lots of examples from their divisions where that is the case. And it's not just in one segment, it's really across the Board. We've been able to pick up share now. So I would just say, we're not doing this with the short-term focus that these have to be sustainable market share gains and they have to be at ITW caliber margins for us to be interested in pursuing them. So it's probably the best answer I can give you on that one.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe my first question really for Michael around the free cash flow outlook. CapEx was down substantially, I think almost 30% in 2020. What slope of recovery do we see there? And how much of a working capital headwind should we expect as well? I suppose the end-point here is to try and understand relative to that $2.6 billion of free cash last year, what the delta is this year in the context of the earnings guidance?\nMichael Larsen: Yes so, Julian. You're right. Some of the capacity expansions that were planned for 2020 were obviously pushed out as a result of the global pandemic, not as a result of anybody at corporate saying you can't invest in your business. This was really our divisions deciding to defer these capacity expansions and as the recovery progresses, those - that CapEx spend will return to normal levels, which is the assumption that's embedded for 2021. We also had in our free cash flow forecast and assumption that we will build up some degree of inventory receivables, working capital to support almost double-digit growth across the enterprise. So we have about $125 million of working capital coming in and that is included in our numbers here and you put it all together, we expect to deliver another strong year from a cash flow perspective at 100% plus conversion from net income.\nJulian Mitchell: And then maybe my follow-up on the uses of that good cash flow and the big cash balance at the end of December, maybe for Scott. I think Scott you've sounded somewhat reticent on M&A at the last earnings call. And then, today we see that buyback placeholder and heard Michael's comments around deferring divestments into 2022. So just wondered what your latest thoughts were on the M&A appetite if you are more or less optimistic on acquisitions today versus a few months ago.\nScott Santi: Yes. What we talked about last call was really around the fact that what we're interested in is quality assets that we can help good companies, so we can help become even better companies and the fact is that during times of maybe disruption that those good companies if we got inside of [indiscernible] time for them to sell their businesses. So the reticence was not from a financial perspective, it was just a statement of reality that the kind of assets that we are interested in acquiring are not available. We - our interest in adding quality assets to ITW that fit our strategy and that meet the criteria that I talked about that was in my response to an earlier question. That doesn't go up and down, that is always there. We have plenty of capacity whether we have cash on hand, whether we have - we need to use the balance sheet, that's just a timing issue. Yeah, we have so much cash. We have the ability to improve these assets we buy, we generate great returns, it's just a matter of the - we're also very disciplined. So we find - we come across an opportunity that we think fits, it's not a situation on what - is it the right time or not, it's at the ample capacity to do it. So we're going to just low our standards because we have been sitting on some cash right now. I think that's the best way I can characterize it. MTS is a compelling hit, it has characteristics that are very similar to our Instron business that we bought back in 2005, entry margins are roughly the same, I think it's around to a couple of points higher, similar end market characteristics, it's a terrific fit that it wouldn't matter what time - what year - where we were in the cycle or what time of year it was, we have another MTS like opportunity, we will take full advantage, do our best to take full advantage of it and that's the best way I can I think say.\nMichael Larsen: And maybe I'll just clarify something, Julian. I mean I think given our track record here as we just talked about in terms of consistently generating strong free cash flow given the strong balance sheet, I don't want you to interpret the fact that the buybacks are coming back, as we don't have capacity to do M&A, because that is certainly not the case. I mean we have ample liquidity as Scott said if the right opportunity comes along, we're going to be certainly looking closely at things. So I wouldn't read anything into buybacks coming back. We are in the fortunate position where - when I talked about the four priorities from a capital allocation standpoint, for us, it's not A, B, C or D, it's really, we can do all of the above. We have the capacity, the financial strength, the balance sheet to do all of the above.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDavid Raso: You mentioned on normalized cost, you'd match the higher cost dollar for dollar, just obviously price, people and cost is not helpful to the margin. So when I think at the full-year guide, the revenue guide, the organic is to 8.5. How much of that is actually coming through with your margin, meaning what percent of the 8.5 prices is simply priced being naked at by cost?\nScott Santi: Well, so we don't really look at it that way, David. So let me try to answer your question, maybe a little bit differently. So I think what I heard you say is we will offset any material cost increases with price on a dollar for dollar basis.\nMichael Larsen: And then I think add a clarification. That means an incremental from here. That doesn't mean necessarily in our plan.\nScott Santi: Correct. Yes.\nScott Santi: That's what we have. That's where you're going with.\nScott Santi: So that's where I was going. So any incremental cost increases that we may see as we go through the year will be offset with price dollar for dollar. Obviously...\nMichael Larsen: And that really reflects the timing front?\nScott Santi: Yes.\nMichael Larsen: That's the problem with delay.\nScott Santi: In the long term, we will. Yeah. We will catch up and we typically get more than that. I think what you're talking about is that in the - if that does mean if you do the math, which I'm sure you've done that can be slightly dilutive to operating margins as we go through the year, but that's not what's in our planning today and our plan today is we are positive price ahead of cost and any cost increases that are coming through will be offset dollar for dollar, that can be a slight lag. We talked a lot about some of the challenges in automotive, so that's probably the best I can answer your question.\nDavid Raso: Now just well, the incrementals are still impressive at 40% and I was just - that's in the guide and I was just curious, are they even higher than that in a way or in a core fashion? Because say 2% of the revenue growth was coming in it at no incremental rate coming at a price versus cost. But overall you're saying add it all up, we're still getting 40% incrementals, if cost go up from here, yes, that might be a bit dilutive on the margin. Just given there might be just pricing cost. That's all I was trying to get at. I mean the 40% is still very. Just trying to get - underlying.\nScott Santi: That's correct, yeah.\nDavid Raso: And when it comes to the M&A pipeline, I mean, obviously, all the facts that are out there and the money in Washington private equity, the MTS business that you bought, somewhat you found something that fits well obviously the margins aren't tremendous but, I think you've probably got it at one time or less, the sales, are you finding with all the facts out there and so forth that you can still find businesses like this that are maybe a little off the radar or it's just going to be a little more challenging to put the money to work. Just give them maybe people are bidding up assets otherwise want to just give in.\nScott Santi: Yes, I think it's not a matter of finding things that are off the radar. The ultimate advantage we have even in a competitive market is the margin improvement potential, so that our ability to pay whatever the multiple is, there are certainly our financial modeling. I'm not suggesting we can pay any multiple but certainly, our ability to pay market multiple and then triple or quadruple the underlying earnings and knowing that we can do that with a high degree of certainty over some period of time is ultimately what allows us to be competitive. So that's, why we've said all along is we're not going to pay for a full - buying or acquiring a fully margin business is not interesting for us because it takes that competitive advantage off the table and from a return standpoint, it makes it all about where you right about the growth rate, 10 years out, which is a pretty challenging thing to get right. So we can compete in the right circumstance and we just proved it. I think.\nDavid Raso: I'm sorry. Please.\nScott Santi: No, you go ahead, please.\nDavid Raso: Well, just seeing for MTS, and I know it's kind of a framework for hopefully future deals you can do, when you think some amortization of the intangibles that are coming in that 6% margin of MTS with a 19. So we think the margin might have been down in '20, what's the level set for us when we think of modeling that say from mid-year and on? What's the starting point for all in the margin amortization, the base we're coming off of and then the ramp to the 20% plus over five years? How much is there a step function in the first full year and then it's kind of, linear from that?\nScott Santi: So they didn't close on the deal first and they do all your accounting and when - and hopefully that'll be mid-year. And so when we get on the earnings call, hopefully for Q2 will be able to give you a lot more detail in terms of the questions that you're asking. Our current view based on what we are - what we have modeled is that there is not going to be a material impact in year one, and then the implementation of the business model takes some time. We didn't buy the business obviously for the potential year one. This is a long-term investment and one we are very pleased with and we see a clear path to get it to ITW caliber margins and returns over the timeframe that we discussed. So, but if you could wait until we get the deal closed and we'll provide all the detail here.\nMichael Larsen: I'll help you with this part, if you want me, which is just figure the margin is steady sequential improvement year-on-year, just like we run the company. There is no big step change. And so the path from 6% or whatever the starting point is to the ITW average is side by side. It\u2019s just a better model than some hockey stick in the early period, if that helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann: Great, thanks for fitting me in. I'll be real quick, Scott, if you gave us a couple of quarters ago a number that you thought you had won some new contracts because of your win with downturns kind of strategy. Any update to that kind of for the full-year 2020?\nScott Santi: Yes, I'll go back to what Michael said that at that point we can count on because that was we've just started, we are a couple of weeks into and there were some obviously visible specific opportunities that we were aware of, at this point, it's far too broad base, it's not something that we're sort of tracking across the company necessarily.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, all right, fair enough. And then...\nScott Santi: Nor should we given the volume, yeah.\nStephen Volkmann: Understood. And then Mike, I think you said PLS is 50 basis points of headwind in '21, isn't that kind of what we should consider sort of normal and the run rate for the foreseeable future?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think like I would look at this, it has still potential, we had modeled 30 basis points as kind of the ongoing run rate, so you're pretty close here.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, that's all I have.\nScott Santi: You're right. We modeled 50 here for 2021. That's correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nRoss Gilardi: Thanks for squeezing me in. Just on the EPS guide, I wanted to clarify why wouldn't the low end be $8 plus when you just turned over $2 in the fourth quarter, you're guiding to $9 to $12 revenue growth. There isn't a lot of seasonality in your business in a normal year. So why wouldn't $2 at a minimum being like an appropriate quarterly run rate? For EPS in the first half and if that's the case, are you taking in a meaningful second-half slowdown? I mean any help you can give us on how your guidance is - looks first half versus second half?\nScott Santi: Yes, so Ross, let me say, first I hope you're right. And second, I'll just go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, in response to one of the questions earlier is that how we have modeled the topline is really using current levels of demand in our - in what we're seeing in our businesses. We're projecting that into the year. If you go and look at kind of historically how a typical year unfolds at ITW in terms of the earnings in the first half versus the second half. It is remarkably consistent. So I think that's probably a good start to help you maybe understand a little bit better, how the things might unfold kind of first half, second half, but to be very clear, again, we are not taking into any of our guidance that demand is going to slow in the second half, we're also not taking in that demand is going to accelerate. So to the extent you have a more positive view in some of the segments, you can certainly model that and see what answer you get, but we are assuming that, like I said, the demand stays, revenue per day stays where it is, adjusted for seasonality projected into 2021.\nRoss Gilardi: Which is on that, Mike. I mean, if you're saying you're just taking current demand, I mean it just gives us current $2 in the fourth quarter.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, but you have to look at maybe, Ross we'll take this one offline and I can walk you through how the historical trends, okay.\nRoss Gilardi: Okay.\nMichael Larsen: I'm not sure how else to answer your question. So, and again, I'm not giving you quarterly guidance, we're giving you full year and I think there's enough information if you look at the historical trends to figure out how things might play out in a quarterly basis.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Two quick ones from me and I know we'll get more details on MTS later, but just given the PLS is part of the framework and equation for you guys like it hasn't, we think about MTS is like revenue trajectory, will there be some PLFS you think at the beginning? And then growth from there, like how should we think about that?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. Again, Joe, as I said earlier, we will provide more of the detailed update once the deal has been closed, but you should assume the PLS is a significant component of the overall ITW business model that we will be implementing, so.\nScott Santi: And it dampens every first couple of years.\nMichael Larsen: It happens in the first, the way it's modeled in the first two to three years all the PLS gets done. And then from there are now, you should see the accelerated growth rate with a higher margin profile that we talked about earlier.\nJoe Ritchie: And then maybe my last question, I might actually going to ask about it because I don't think I've ever asked the question on polymers and fluids on a conference call. But the growth rate has really picked up in the segment in the last couple of quarters, and obviously, you have a good outlook for 2021. Just maybe talk a little bit about how you feel about the - either new product introductions or sustainability about growth rate just given the segment has gone through several years of PLS and then it seems like it's now a turning growth.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think you're right, I mean, we've done a lot of - team's done a lot of PLS over the years, a big focus on organic growth, we continue to see certainly good progress in terms of new products. I talked earlier about on average at the company level, we get a percentage point from customer back innovation, we're actually getting rate that's doubled at in polymers and fluids, so certainly the team has executed well on the organic growth framework and made progress on strategic sales excellence. And I think it certainly helped that some of the end markets were quite favorable in Q4, and the outlook for '21 is pretty good in areas such as health and hygiene. We are seeing a recovery in MRO applications and the retail side related to automotive aftermarket has been solid too, so I will pass on your comments to the polymers and fluids team.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thank you.\nScott Santi: I'll be throughout, if they got a question.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. I think we are out of time. So I'll just say to everybody, thanks for joining us this morning. And if you have any follow-up, just give me a call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see solid recovery progress in many of the end markets that we serve as evidenced by our revenue being up sequentially 5% versus the third quarter. The increase is 8% when you adjust for equal number of days when historically our revenue per day has increased by 1% from Q3 to Q4. Overall, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, operating income of $883 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year, operating margin of 24.4%, free cash flow of $705 million, and GAAP EPS of $2.02. After-tax return on invested capital improved to 32%. And as Scott mentioned, operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were fourth quarter records for the company. Revenue in all major geographies improved sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, North America organic revenue declined 3%, International revenue grew 1%, Europe was down 2%. Similar to Q3, China was the bright spot with 11% growth. As we've talked about before, the operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system also applies to the cost structure, which was on full display through our operating margin performance in Q4. We improved operating margin by 170 basis points to 25.4%, the second-highest margin rate in a quarter in the history of the company. And like I say, grew operating income 7% to $883 million, the highest fourth quarter ever. The biggest driver of our margin improvement remains our enterprise initiatives, as the ITW team executed on projects and activities that contributed 130 basis points in Q4. The impact was broad-based with all segments delivering enterprise initiatives benefits in the range of 80 to 170 basis points. GAAP EPS was $2.02, up 2%, but keep in mind, the Q4 last year had $0.11of one-time gains from divestitures. If you exclude those gains, EPS was up 7%, the same as operating income. Working capital performance was excellent and free cash flow of $705 million was solid with a conversion rate of 110% of net income. Finally, the effective tax rate was 22.1%, down slightly from last year. In summary, a strong finish to a challenging year and very good momentum as we head into 2021. Let's move to Slide 5 to review fourth quarter's recovery and response by segment. We updated this slide from our last earnings call with Q4 information and you can see that our segments continue to respond effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenue and operating margin. I would just highlight a few things to illustrate the resilience and adaptability of our businesses. You can see the rapid recovery in our end markets, relative to the Q2 bottom, but down 27%. In Q4, three of our segments experienced demand levels that were higher than a year ago. The most pronounced recovery has been in automotive OEM, which is more than doubled since Q2 and grew 8% year-over-year in Q4, as did construction products. Polymers and Fluids grew 7% while demand in three segments, Test & Measurement and electronics, welding and specialty products was only slightly lower year-over-year. As you would expect food equipment continues to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we are seeing some sequential improvement. Overall, you can see the benefit of having a high quality diversified portfolio and the fact that we're back to demand levels of a year ago with total revenue essentially flat year-over-year despite one of our core segments being down organically by 19%. On the right side of the page, you can see the operating flexibility that I just talked about and how to also apply to our cost structure and ultimately shows up in our operating margin performance. At the bottom, in Q2, we still delivered solid operating margins of 17.5% and only two segments were below 20%. In Q4, were almost 800 basis points higher at 25.4% despite no volume growth year-over-year and every segment is back about 22% including Food Equipment and six out of seven segments achieved record fourth quarter operating margins. Let's move on to Slide 6 for a closer look at individual segment performance, starting with automotive OEM. The team has continued to execute exceptionally well from a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to customer demand levels that have more than doubled since Q2. In Q4, organic growth of 8% year-over-year was the highest growth rate since the first quarter of 2017. While North America was flat in Q2, it was more than offset by strong demand in Europe, which grew 10% and China, which grew 20%. As expected, food equipment end markets remained challenged in Q4, organic revenue was down 19%, a little better than the third quarter, and demand in Q4 was similar to Q3 when you look at it by geography and the end markets. North America was down 20%, international down 18%, equipment sales were down 20% and service was down 18%. Institutional demand was down about 30% with restaurants down a little bit more than that. And not surprisingly, the bright spot throughout the year, continue to be retail with organic growth of 8%. Moving to Slide 7 for Test & Measurement and Electronics. Q4 organic revenue declined 3% with Test & Measurement down 8% against the tough comparison of plus 6% in Q4 '19. Electronics was up 3% and while demand for capital equipment remains sluggish, the segment benefited from considerable strength in several end-markets, including semiconductor, healthcare and clean room. As you may have seen on January 19, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Amphenol to acquire MTS's Test & Simulation Business. The Test & Simulation Business is very complementary to our Instron business, which we highlighted during our 2018 Investor Day and some of you may have visited our facility outside of Boston. MTS's Test & Simulation business has similar organic growth potential and there is substantial opportunity for margin improvement through the application of the ITW business model. Pre-COVID revenues in fiscal year 2019 were $559 million with operating margin of 6%. We expect to get the business to generate ITW caliber operating margins by the end of year five and generate after-tax ROIC in the high teens by the end of year 10. As you saw in the announcement, we expect the acquisition to close in the middle of 2021 and we're very much looking forward to welcoming the MTS Test & Simulation team to the ITW family. Moving on, please turn to Slide 8. In welding, where we saw a meaningful pickup in demand as organic revenue improved from being down 10% year-over-year in Q3 to only being down 2% in Q4. Our commercial business which primarily serves smaller businesses and individual users and accounts for 35% of the revenue in this segment remained strong and grew 12% year-over-year. Our Industrial business showed signs of strong recovery from being down 23% in Q3 to down only 5% in Q4 as customer activity and equipment orders gained strength. Overall organic revenue food equipment was flat versus prior year and much improved versus a 10% decline in the third quarter. Polymers & Fluids delivered strong organic growth of 7% with fluids up 16% with continued strong demand in end-markets related to healthcare and hygiene. The automotive aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales with organic growth of 5% and polymers grew 4% with solid demand for MRO and automotive applications. Moving to Slide 9. Construction continues to benefit from strong demand in the home center channel and delivered organic growth of 8% in Q4. Growth was strong across all geographies with North America up 10%, double-digit growth in the residential renovation market offset by commercial construction, which represents only about 15% of North America revenue down 11%. Europe grew 9% and Australia/New Zealand grew 5% due to strong retail sales. Specialty organic revenue was down 3% this quarter with North America down 2% and international revenue down 4%. Demand for consumer packaging remains solid, but it was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses. So that concludes the segment commentary and let's move on to the full year 2020 summer results in Slide 10. And in the face of unprecedented challenges that included temporary customer shutdowns across wide swaths of our end markets during the year, organic revenue was down 10%. Still we delivered operating income of $2.9 billion and highly resilient operating margin of 22.9%, only down 120 basis points year-over-year despite no major cost takeout initiatives on mandates, and with the strong contribution of 120 basis points from our Enterprise Initiatives. After-tax ROIC was 26.2% and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Throughout the pandemic, one of our priorities was to maintain our financial strength, liquidity, and strategic optionality, and as you can see, we did just that in 2020. ITW's balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity. We did not have a need to issue any debt or commercial paper in 2020 and we ended the year with total debt to EBITDA leverage of 2.5 times, which is only slightly above our 2.25 times target. At year-end, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. With 2020 behind us, let's move to Slide 11 for a discussion of our guidance for 2021. So starting with the caveat that we continue to operate in a fairly uncertain economic environment, we have based our guidance as we always do on the current levels of demand in our businesses. Per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. The outcome of that exercise is a forecast of solid broad-based organic growth of 7% to 10% at the enterprise level. Foreign currency at today's exchange rates is favorable and has 2 percentage points revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 9% to 12%. At our typical incremental margins of 35% to 40%, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $7.60 to $8 a share, up 18% at the midpoint. We're forecasting operating margin in the range of 24% to 25%, which is an improvement of more than 150 basis points year-over-year at the midpoint. Enterprise Initiatives are a key driver of operating margin expansion in 2021, as are expected to contribute approximately 100 basis points. Restructuring and price costs are expected to be approximately margin neutral year-over-year. We're closely monitoring the raw material cost environment and embedded in our 2021 guidance are the known raw material cost increases in commodities such as steel, resins and chemicals. Given the differentiated nature of our product offerings across the company, we expect to be able to offset the impact of any incremental raw material cost increases that might arise in 2021 with pricing actions on a dollar for dollar basis. We expect strong free cash flow in 2021 with a conversion rate greater than 100% of net income. I wanted to provide a brief update on our capital allocation plans for 2021. Top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our core businesses. Second, we recognize the importance of an attractive dividend to our long-term shareholders and we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third priority, our selective high-quality acquisitions to supplement our portfolio and reinforce or further enhance ITW's long-term organic growth potential. I should point out that the guidance we're providing today is for the core business only. After the MTS Test & Simulation acquisition closes, we'll provide you with an update, but we do not expect a material impact in 2021. In line with our capital allocation, we returned surplus capital to shareholders and we are reinstating share repurchases with a plan to invest approximately $1 billion in 2021. We expect our tax rate for the year to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Finally, when it comes to portfolio management, we have decided to defer any divestiture activity until next year. And instead, focus on our time and efforts on the recovery in 2021. While our view regarding the long-term strategic fit of the remaining divestitures hasn't changed, we also believe that given their expected performance this year, they will be more valuable in 2022. Let's turn to Slide 12 and the forecast for organic growth by segment. With the caveat again and the environment remains fairly uncertain, we are providing an organic growth outlook for each segment and based on current levels of demand, we are forecasting solid broad-based growth as every segment is expected to improve their organic growth rate in 2021. At the enterprise level, it all adds up to solid organic growth of 7% to 10%. To wrap it all up, ITW finished a challenging year strong, as we continue to fully leverage the capabilities and competitive advantages that we've built over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy. Our strong operational and financial performance in 2020 provided further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper-tier performance in any environment. Looking ahead to 2021, we have good momentum from Q4 heading into the year and our solid guidance reflects the fact that we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. With that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Well, I'd say, Andy, we - based on our bottoms-up planning process, we expect every segment to improve on their margin performance in 2021, as Scott said, a little bit better every year as we march towards our full potential. I think one of the remarkable things, when you look at the margin performance by segment is how the range has narrowed and we're - as we sit here today, the low-end is food equipment at 22% and the high-end is welding at 29%, very different range from when we started this strategy eight years ago. And I think the fact that we have businesses, delivery margins in the high 20s just gives us further confidence in the long-term goals that we've laid out for the company. So the big driver in 2021 remains Enterprise Initiatives. Those are broad-based in every segment will make progress on 80/20 and Strategic Sourcing, and certainly, we expect that also a meaningful contribution from volume leverage as we go through the year here. But I wouldn't single any segment out as having more margin improvement potential than others. I think we expect all of our segments to continue to make progress towards their full potential. Yes, Andy, and I can give you a little bit on price costs. So certainly, like I said, we are closely monitoring the raw material cost environment, we are seeing inflationary pressures in commodities such as steel, resins, certain chemicals, by segments, automotive, construction, and polymers and fluids is probably where we're seeing the more significant increases. In all of our segments, the plan is to offset those cost increases, the ones that we know about and the ones that may arise this year with price on a dollar for dollar basis. As you know, in automotive, just given the nature of the industry that is a process that takes a little bit longer, but we're confident that over time, we're going to be able to offset any raw material cost increases with price, just given the differentiated nature of our product offerings in each one of these segments, so. Yes. So thank you, Nicole. I... So just on the - there's a lot of talk about the shortage of semiconductor in the automotive OEM space. What I can tell you is, and this is true across all of our businesses, we've not seen a slowdown in demand and strong momentum going into the year, certainly carried through January. It is possible, though, that we may see some production slowdown here in Q1 at some of our customers, whether that will impact the demand, their demand for our products, I think remains to be seen. We view this right now as more of a timing issue and so certainly, this could put a little bit of pressure on the auto business here in the first quarter. But as we sit here today, we would assume that we're going to catch that up in Q2 or the second half of the year. In terms of the quarterly cadence for the auto business. I think you saw the strong performance here in the fourth quarter, up 8%. Like I said, we've not seen anything to suggest that that demand is slowing down while we're looking at the January results. So we expect, given how we've planned the business to be off to a pretty good start with positive organic growth and margin improvement in the first quarter that typically sequentially that builds as we go through the year. Q2 will be, as Scott said, the biggest quarter and the second half, the comps start to get a little bit more challenging, the build numbers are a little bit different but that's probably as much as I can give you on the automotive business and kind of how this might play out by quarter. No, I think it's pretty - I think the comps are a little bit easier in Europe, maybe in North America but we, really on a global basis, we had a good year. But, so that's really all that I would point to. Yes. So I think welding, strong finish to the year good momentum going into 2021 and I'd say a pretty solid outlook for all end markets, maybe with the exception of the oil and gas piece, which is somewhere in the 15% to 20%, it's probably closer to 15% of total revenues that is expected to remain soft as we go through the year. But the commercial business has been strong all year and no signs of that slowing down the industrial side. So this is what Scott talked about with CapEx may be picking up as this recovery path is a little clearer. We're expecting a solid year in the welding business with again continued progress on the margin side, despite the fact that they put up almost 29% here in the fourth quarter. And I would just add financially speaking, John, our internal investments, new product, our top priority from a capital allocation standpoint, then if you look at our new product investment in 2020, it was the same number as in 2019 as we stayed invested in these projects and strategies to drive above market organic growth. Historically, we've achieved about a percentage point of organic growth every year for new products and that's kind of we're counting on in every segment as we move forward. Yes, so, Jamie, on your first question, we are seeing an increase in freight cost. It is not one of the largest, categories when we look at where we're seeing cost pressure, but it is any known increases in terms of freight and logistics are embedded in our plan, in our guidance here today. I think in terms of market share, as a result of being able to maintain delivery and quality, if we were to talk to our segments, they would all be able to come up with lots of examples from their divisions where that is the case. And it's not just in one segment, it's really across the Board. We've been able to pick up share now. So I would just say, we're not doing this with the short-term focus that these have to be sustainable market share gains and they have to be at ITW caliber margins for us to be interested in pursuing them. So it's probably the best answer I can give you on that one. Yes so, Julian. You're right. Some of the capacity expansions that were planned for 2020 were obviously pushed out as a result of the global pandemic, not as a result of anybody at corporate saying you can't invest in your business. This was really our divisions deciding to defer these capacity expansions and as the recovery progresses, those - that CapEx spend will return to normal levels, which is the assumption that's embedded for 2021. We also had in our free cash flow forecast and assumption that we will build up some degree of inventory receivables, working capital to support almost double-digit growth across the enterprise. So we have about $125 million of working capital coming in and that is included in our numbers here and you put it all together, we expect to deliver another strong year from a cash flow perspective at 100% plus conversion from net income. And maybe I'll just clarify something, Julian. I mean I think given our track record here as we just talked about in terms of consistently generating strong free cash flow given the strong balance sheet, I don't want you to interpret the fact that the buybacks are coming back, as we don't have capacity to do M&A, because that is certainly not the case. I mean we have ample liquidity as Scott said if the right opportunity comes along, we're going to be certainly looking closely at things. So I wouldn't read anything into buybacks coming back. We are in the fortunate position where - when I talked about the four priorities from a capital allocation standpoint, for us, it's not A, B, C or D, it's really, we can do all of the above. We have the capacity, the financial strength, the balance sheet to do all of the above. And then I think add a clarification. That means an incremental from here. That doesn't mean necessarily in our plan. And that really reflects the timing front? That's the problem with delay. I'll help you with this part, if you want me, which is just figure the margin is steady sequential improvement year-on-year, just like we run the company. There is no big step change. And so the path from 6% or whatever the starting point is to the ITW average is side by side. It's just a better model than some hockey stick in the early period, if that helps. Yes. I think like I would look at this, it has still potential, we had modeled 30 basis points as kind of the ongoing run rate, so you're pretty close here. Yes, but you have to look at maybe, Ross we'll take this one offline and I can walk you through how the historical trends, okay. I'm not sure how else to answer your question. So, and again, I'm not giving you quarterly guidance, we're giving you full year and I think there's enough information if you look at the historical trends to figure out how things might play out in a quarterly basis. Yes. Again, Joe, as I said earlier, we will provide more of the detailed update once the deal has been closed, but you should assume the PLS is a significant component of the overall ITW business model that we will be implementing, so. It happens in the first, the way it's modeled in the first two to three years all the PLS gets done. And then from there are now, you should see the accelerated growth rate with a higher margin profile that we talked about earlier. Yes, I think you're right, I mean, we've done a lot of - team's done a lot of PLS over the years, a big focus on organic growth, we continue to see certainly good progress in terms of new products. I talked earlier about on average at the company level, we get a percentage point from customer back innovation, we're actually getting rate that's doubled at in polymers and fluids, so certainly the team has executed well on the organic growth framework and made progress on strategic sales excellence. And I think it certainly helped that some of the end markets were quite favorable in Q4, and the outlook for '21 is pretty good in areas such as health and hygiene. We are seeing a recovery in MRO applications and the retail side related to automotive aftermarket has been solid too, so I will pass on your comments to the polymers and fluids team."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. The ITW team closed out 2020 with another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. From my perspective, the highlights are the Q4 revenues got back to year-ago levels despite food equipment being down 17% and net operating income, operating margin and after-tax ROIC were all Q4 records for the company. It was a pretty solid finish to the year that needless to say, provided some unique and unprecedented circumstances and challenges, and indicates good momentum as we head into 2021. While it was the challenges brought about by the pandemic that dominated our attention in 2020, it was the collection of capabilities and competitive advantages that we have built and honed over the past eight years through the execution of our enterprise strategy that provided us with the options to respond to them as we did. Early on as the pandemic unfolded, we refocused the entire company on only two core imperatives. A, to protect the health, safety and well-being of our people, and B, to continue to serve our customers with excellence. And in my view, we executed extremely well on both. Our manufacturing, operations and customer service teams around the world deserve special recognition for their extraordinary efforts and leadership in support of these two key pandemic priorities. Their dedication and commitment to keeping themselves and their colleagues safe while continuing to deliver excellent service to our customers was truly inspiring and there is no question that we differentiate ourselves with many of our key customers, as a result of our ability to sustain our normal rock-solid quality and delivery performance throughout 2020 as a result of their efforts. We also did our best to take full advantage of ITW's position of strength as we've thought through, how we should manage the company through the pandemic. Back in the spring, as we analyzed and stress-tested the Company's performance across a wide range of scenarios, it became clear that the financial and competitive strengths that we had built up over the past eight years have resulted in a very strong and very resilient company. And as a result, we didn't have to just pull out our old recession playbook and hunker down. And for ITW, this was a unique opportunity to react smartly and to stay focused on the long-term. This conclusion led to two key decisions that we made regarding how we're going to manage ITW through the pandemic crisis. First, we chose to leverage the strong financial foundation that we've built over the last eight years to reinforce our commitment to our people. First, by providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues through the entirety of Q2 when the economic effects of the pandemic were at their most widespread and severe. And by deciding that we would not initiate any enterprise-wide employment reduction mandates or programs at any point in 2020. These were not obvious or easy decisions given the unprecedented and uncertain circumstances but we believe that they were the right decisions for our company. And I know that our people will remember them. These decisions also turned out to be the right ones for us operationally, given the pace of demand recovery that we saw beginning in Q3. Second, we chose to leverage our position of strength by implementing our Win the Recovery agenda and mindset across the Company. Win the Recovery was not an opportunistic new strategy. What it was and is a commitment to staying the course and continuing to prioritize the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy despite the unique and unprecedented challenges brought about by the global pandemic. Win the Recovery for us did not mean ignore the pandemic. As across the company, we had to read and react to the realities of the near-term situation as we always do but it does mean that we are committed to protecting key investment supporting the execution of our long-term strategy and that we have from very early on, given our divisional leadership teams to mandate to continue to think long-term and to remain aggressive through the pandemic. For 2021, our Win the Recovery posture and mindset continues on and serves as the central theme driving the 2021operating plans for every one of our 83 divisions. Before I turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q4 performance and our 2021 guidance, let me close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional performance and dedication in the face of the most challenging and unprecedented circumstances of the past year. The performance that they delivered in 2020 provides another proof point that ITW as a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, resilience and agility necessary to deliver consistent top tier performance in any environment. Like many of you, I'm sure we are hopeful for a return to somewhere in the vicinity of normal at some point in 2021 and with that getting back to giving our full attention to taking ITW all the way for the company's full potential. Between now and whenever that is, we will continue to leverage the full breadth of ITW's capabilities and competitive advantages to keep our people safe, continue to serve our customers with excellence and execute our long-term enterprise strategy. Michael, over to you. Well, I'd say a couple of things, Andy. First of all, this has been a process throughout the entire journey where the sort of further we go with that, the more opportunity we find to continue to improve. And I think one of the remarkable things from our perspective is eight years into this, I don't see that slowing up any. And so we are focused on continuing to move forward to get better every year, get a little bit better this year than we were last year. Within the framework of this, the strategy that we've laid out and I think there remains ample room to continue on that path for a number of years. We also have some performance goals out there. You're right, it's been a couple of years, but two years ago, it's when we update those goals, and we remain absolutely on track and committed to delivering on those goals. And as we get closer to that, we'll figure out what the next step is - steps are. I can tell you one thing on the quarterly cadence that Q2 is going to be a lot better this year than with last year. That's the one thing I know for sure. I agree with that. Well, I - the only way that it's - that's factored in at this point is, it's embedded in the impact of those efforts have already made in our current run rates. So we are not baking in any further acceleration, it doesn't mean that we don't have a lot of intention around continuing to as we've talked about before, be aggressive as the recovery continues to accelerate, but from the standpoint of our normal planning practice, we are - what's embedded in our organic growth forecast is exactly what Michael said earlier, the current run rates - daily run rates projected through full-year 2021 with whatever the normal sort of seasonal impacts are quarter-by-quarter. Yes, I think that's where the proof is got to be in the project and that's what we've been working on. And so I, certainly in 2020 and '21, I think to try to get any sense of sort of what the market baselines are given the - just the overall volatility in all the, let's say the corresponding supply chain impacts on demand and inventory levels and all that stuff, it's really, it's almost possible to tell, but I would absolutely expect that our ability to stay focused and aggressive on the growth agenda through all of this, I won't say a better payoff but I'd say it's payoff is what we're all about. That's what we've been doing all this stuff for. So I won't tell you that every one of our 83 divisions are all the way there, but I guarantee you that I can say that 90% of them are in great position, are doing all the right things, have stayed focused and have stayed aggressive through this, we're not in that, we're not using the ready to grow and not growing categories anymore. I'll put it that way. It's - I think we're well past that point. That's exactly what I told our EVP, Ann. Just so you know. So what I'd tell you, Ann is that obviously, a strong year for the construction business and finishing Q4, up 8% on a year-over-year basis, a lot of strength in the home centers that we've talked about really since the beginning of the pandemic, and we expect that to be just given the comps that the growth in the home centers would be in the low single-digits. We - there are some encouraging signs around housing starts. And then we have a great portfolio of highly differentiated products. So you put all of that together, I think our view is we should be able to grow in the mid to high single-digits here in 2021. And as I said, we're off to a good start here in January, so. Yes, I can't really think of anything, particularly given the environment we're in, other than point to what we've been talking about throughout, which is we stayed focused on implementing those, the relevant changes, strategic changes business by business along the lines of what you're talking about throughout this entire - throughout the entirety of 2020. So I think if anything, the most significant part of what we accomplished in '20 is we stayed ready, we stayed prepared, we stayed in position and we kept moving the ball. And so I don't know that there is any big shifts that I can point to as much as the fact that we stayed in there and kept moving forward while dealing with the pretty unusual set of near-term circumstances and I expect that that will pay significant dividends, particularly if the rate of recovery continues on as we're seeing right now. Yes, relative. New products are core - it's a core I want to - of our business model, customer back innovation we have been - there has been no change in terms of the central nature of that as our strategy. We're banging out a couple of thousand patents a year. Year in, year out, that certainly continued on in 2020 as it always has. So I don't know that there has been any inflection or change in terms of our posture there. It is, in my view, it's the only way we outgrow our markets over the long haul. We're going to get some penetration from our service capabilities from our ability to attract new customers, but in the end, innovation, new products, new technologies, or existing products is the key and core driver ultimately of our, I believe they outgrow our markets consistently over time. That's not a new concept here. Yes. I just go back to our, basically two criteria. One is that we - It has to - we have to - if we're going to make that kind of an investment in terms of not just to our capital, but our time, effort and energy, it has to be in something that we have a lot of conviction about that can support or further accelerate the company's long-term growth potential. And we have to also have significant potential for margin improvement from 80/20. If you look at MTS and that absolutely checks both of those boxes. So I don't - we don't have anything that in my view as off-limits, if those criteria are met and I'll just leave it at that. I am not good at that, but I will also say, as more we're leaning in super harder on one particular sector or another. I think as we've talked about before, we have demonstrated ability to perform and execute across seven businesses today. So ultimately, it's much more a function of the individual characteristics of the asset that we're talking about than it is any sort of outside-in view of, we want to - we need to get growth year or play for a certain theory about long-term end-market growth. Yes. What we talked about last call was really around the fact that what we're interested in is quality assets that we can help good companies, so we can help become even better companies and the fact is that during times of maybe disruption that those good companies if we got inside of [indiscernible] time for them to sell their businesses. So the reticence was not from a financial perspective, it was just a statement of reality that the kind of assets that we are interested in acquiring are not available. We - our interest in adding quality assets to ITW that fit our strategy and that meet the criteria that I talked about that was in my response to an earlier question. That doesn't go up and down, that is always there. We have plenty of capacity whether we have cash on hand, whether we have - we need to use the balance sheet, that's just a timing issue. Yeah, we have so much cash. We have the ability to improve these assets we buy, we generate great returns, it's just a matter of the - we're also very disciplined. So we find - we come across an opportunity that we think fits, it's not a situation on what - is it the right time or not, it's at the ample capacity to do it. So we're going to just low our standards because we have been sitting on some cash right now. I think that's the best way I can characterize it. MTS is a compelling hit, it has characteristics that are very similar to our Instron business that we bought back in 2005, entry margins are roughly the same, I think it's around to a couple of points higher, similar end market characteristics, it's a terrific fit that it wouldn't matter what time - what year - where we were in the cycle or what time of year it was, we have another MTS like opportunity, we will take full advantage, do our best to take full advantage of it and that's the best way I can I think say. Well, so we don't really look at it that way, David. So let me try to answer your question, maybe a little bit differently. So I think what I heard you say is we will offset any material cost increases with price on a dollar for dollar basis. Correct. Yes. That's what we have. That's where you're going with. So that's where I was going. So any incremental cost increases that we may see as we go through the year will be offset with price dollar for dollar. Obviously... Yes. In the long term, we will. Yeah. We will catch up and we typically get more than that. I think what you're talking about is that in the - if that does mean if you do the math, which I'm sure you've done that can be slightly dilutive to operating margins as we go through the year, but that's not what's in our planning today and our plan today is we are positive price ahead of cost and any cost increases that are coming through will be offset dollar for dollar, that can be a slight lag. We talked a lot about some of the challenges in automotive, so that's probably the best I can answer your question. That's correct, yeah. Yes, I think it's not a matter of finding things that are off the radar. The ultimate advantage we have even in a competitive market is the margin improvement potential, so that our ability to pay whatever the multiple is, there are certainly our financial modeling. I'm not suggesting we can pay any multiple but certainly, our ability to pay market multiple and then triple or quadruple the underlying earnings and knowing that we can do that with a high degree of certainty over some period of time is ultimately what allows us to be competitive. So that's, why we've said all along is we're not going to pay for a full - buying or acquiring a fully margin business is not interesting for us because it takes that competitive advantage off the table and from a return standpoint, it makes it all about where you right about the growth rate, 10 years out, which is a pretty challenging thing to get right. So we can compete in the right circumstance and we just proved it. I think. No, you go ahead, please. So they didn't close on the deal first and they do all your accounting and when - and hopefully that'll be mid-year. And so when we get on the earnings call, hopefully for Q2 will be able to give you a lot more detail in terms of the questions that you're asking. Our current view based on what we are - what we have modeled is that there is not going to be a material impact in year one, and then the implementation of the business model takes some time. We didn't buy the business obviously for the potential year one. This is a long-term investment and one we are very pleased with and we see a clear path to get it to ITW caliber margins and returns over the timeframe that we discussed. So, but if you could wait until we get the deal closed and we'll provide all the detail here. Yes, I'll go back to what Michael said that at that point we can count on because that was we've just started, we are a couple of weeks into and there were some obviously visible specific opportunities that we were aware of, at this point, it's far too broad base, it's not something that we're sort of tracking across the company necessarily. Nor should we given the volume, yeah. You're right. We modeled 50 here for 2021. That's correct. Yes, so Ross, let me say, first I hope you're right. And second, I'll just go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, in response to one of the questions earlier is that how we have modeled the topline is really using current levels of demand in our - in what we're seeing in our businesses. We're projecting that into the year. If you go and look at kind of historically how a typical year unfolds at ITW in terms of the earnings in the first half versus the second half. It is remarkably consistent. So I think that's probably a good start to help you maybe understand a little bit better, how the things might unfold kind of first half, second half, but to be very clear, again, we are not taking into any of our guidance that demand is going to slow in the second half, we're also not taking in that demand is going to accelerate. So to the extent you have a more positive view in some of the segments, you can certainly model that and see what answer you get, but we are assuming that, like I said, the demand stays, revenue per day stays where it is, adjusted for seasonality projected into 2021. And it dampens every first couple of years. I'll be throughout, if they got a question."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Julienne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2020 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter 2020 financial results and provide an update on our strategy for managing through the global pandemic.  Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2019 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.  Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. We saw solid recovery progress in many of the end markets that we serve in the third quarter, as evidenced by our revenue being up 29% sequentially versus the second quarter. In fact, demand levels returned to rates approximating year ago levels in five of our seven segments, with two of those, Construction and Polymers & Fluids delivering meaningful growth in the third quarter.  On the flip side, demand levels in our Food Equipment and Welding segments continued to be materially impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we did see good sequential improvement in both in Q3 versus Q2. We talk often about the flexibility and responsiveness inherent in our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system. And those attributes were clearly on display in our Q3 performance. Supported by our decision early on as the pandemic unfolded to refrain from initiating staffing reductions and to focus on positioning the company to fully participate in the recovery, our people around the world responded to a rapid acceleration in demand by leveraging the ITW business model to provide excellent service to our customers, while keeping themselves and their coworkers safe. Perhaps the most pronounced example was our Auto OEM segment, where our team executed flawlessly from both a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to demand levels that essentially doubled in Q3 versus Q2, and with a demand -- a very demanding customer base. Across all seven of our segments, our teams can cite numerous examples of how our ability to sustain high levels of service in the face of rapidly accelerating demand resulted in incremental business for the company in Q3. In addition to leveraging our best-in-class delivery capabilities, our divisions remain laser-focused on leveraging our strengths to capture sustainable share gain opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy. These efforts are just beginning to take hold. And I'm confident that they will contribute meaningfully to accelerating our progress towards our long-term organic growth goals. The operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system also applies to our cost structure, which showed through our operating margin performance in Q3. Operating margin of 23.8% in the quarter included meaningfully higher restructuring expenses versus a year ago in two segments specific one-time items which Michael will provide more detail on in a few minutes. Excluding these factors, operating margin was 25.3% in Q3, the second highest in the history of the company. Overall, the pace of recovery in the third quarter exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter, as we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, operating income of $789 million, free cash flow $631 million and GAAP EPS of $1.83. In addition, after tax return on invested capital improved to 29.6%, an all-time high for the company. It goes without saying that I could not be more proud of how the ITW team is managing through this challenging period. And I want to sincerely thank my 45,000 plus ITW colleagues around the world for their continued exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. In the face of unprecedented challenges and circumstances, our operational and financial performance over the last few quarters supports our decision to remain fully invested in the key initiatives supporting the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy and provides further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment. Moving forward, we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q3 performance. Michael?\nMichael Larsen : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Since the beginning of the pandemic, maintaining ITW's considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality has been a priority. Our objective was to fully leverage the strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile that we have built over the last 7 years to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. And as the recovery progressed ahead of our expectations going into the quarter, we were ready to meet customer demand, and we delivered strong financial results.  Q3 revenue was up 29% or almost $750 million sequentially versus Q2. And on a year-over-year basis, organic revenue declined only 4.6% compared to a 27% decline in Q2. The impact of last year's divestitures was 1% and was essentially offset by 0.7% of favorable currency impact. Product line simplification was 30 basis points in the quarter. Despite the negative volume leverage and our decision to stay invested in our key strategic priorities, Q3 operating margin was 23.8%, down only 120 basis points compared to prior year. If you set aside the impact of higher restructuring expenses and 2 one-time segment items that I will describe in a moment, operating margin would actually have increased year-over-year to 25.3%. Strong execution on our enterprise initiatives was a big contributor once again at 120 basis points as all segments delivered benefits in the range of 70 basis points to 190 basis points. As expected, our decremental margins were a little higher than normal at 46% in the third quarter. Excluding the 2 one-time items that I just mentioned and the higher restructuring expense, our decremental margins would have been about 20%, significantly better than our historical decrementals of 35% to 40%. Operating income was $789 million and GAAP EPS was $1.83, with an effective tax rate of 21.3%, in line with last year's 21.6%. Solid working capital performance contributed to free cash flow of $631 million and a conversion rate of 108% of net income. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $1.9 billion, with a conversion rate of 127% compared to 105% last year. We now expect free cash flow to end the year significantly above $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion of cash on hand, no commercial paper and a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.7 billion. In terms of our debt structure, you can see an increase of $350 million in the short-term debt, which is simply a reclassification from long-term to short-term as our 2021 bonds are coming due in less than 12 months. So in summary, a very good quarter operationally and financially as the recovery progressed well ahead of our previous expectations. Moving on to Slide 4 for a closer look at the third quarter recovery and response by each segment. You can see that every segment responded effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenues and operating margin. I would highlight just a few things that Scott mentioned, including the fact that our Automotive OEM segment was able to essentially double their volumes in a quarter or just 90 days as operating margins swung from negative to 20% plus. In addition, 6 of 7 segments had operating margins, not segment margins, operating margins above 20%. FEG, Food Equipment was just below 20%, but we expect them to get above 20% in Q4 despite the fact that they are operating in a pretty challenging environment. Next to Slide 5, starting with a quick look at organic revenue by geography. As you can see, customer demand improved in every region. North America declined by only 5% in Q3 compared to down 26% in Q2. Europe also improved significantly, down only 8%, a sequential improvement of almost 30 percentage points. Asia Pacific turned positive this quarter, up 3%; and China was the standout, up 10% as the recovery continued to take hold. In China, specifically, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, and Specialty Products, all grew double-digits. So in summary, broad-based geographic recovery in the quarter. Now let's walk through each segment, starting with the one that experienced the most pronounced recovery, Automotive OEM. In a matter of weeks, our customers went from being shut down to operating close to full capacity and the team responded by leveraging their experienced workforce, local supply chains and flexible operating system to quickly ramp up and meet customer demand. Overall, organic revenue was still down 5% year-over-year, with North America down 10% and Europe down 5%. China, which had already turned positive last quarter at 6%, also improved sequentially and was up 15% this quarter. Lastly, as we discussed on our last call, we did initiate a few restructuring projects that were part of our 2020 plan pre-pandemic which led to a reduction in operating margins of 150 basis points to 20.8%. Turning to Slide 6. As expected, Food Equipment was the hardest hit segment in the quarter as organic revenue declined 20%, a significant improvement, though, from being down 38% in Q2. North America and international organic revenue were both down about 20%. Equipment sales were down 21% and service was down 17%. Institutional demand was down about 30% and restaurants, including QSR, were down a little bit more than that. On a positive note, retail, which includes grocery stores, grew more than 30% supported by the rollout of new products. Despite the significant negative volume leverage and higher restructuring expense, operating margin was still 19.6%. Excluding the higher restructuring impact, margins would have been 21.4%. And I think it's worth noting that in this most challenging environment, the segment generated almost $19 million in operating income. In Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue declined only 2%, with Test & Measurement down 6% and Electronics up 2%. While demand for capital equipment remains soft, the segment benefited from considerable strength in a number of end markets, including semiconductor, healthcare and clean room technology. As you can see from the footnote, the reported operating margin of 23.7% included 350 basis points of unfavorable impact from removing a potential divestiture from assets held-for-sale. Excluding this impact, the operating margin would have been 27.2%, which is a much more accurate representation of the underlying profitability of this segment. Given the current environment, we simply decided to defer this divestiture for now. Speaking of divestitures, let me make a broader comment on our portfolio management efforts and specifically the 2018 decision to divest 7 businesses that we determined no longer fit our enterprise strategy framework, with revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect at that completion of these divestitures will improve our overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and increase enterprise operating margins by 100 basis points. In 2019, we made good progress completing 4 divestitures with revenues of approximately $150 million. And we are seeing the benefits in our financials this year, including 20 basis points of operating margin impact. While the pandemic put a hold on our efforts this year, our view regarding the long-term strategy fit of the remaining divestitures has not changed. Accordingly, we will resume the sale process for these businesses when market conditions normalize. Okay. Turning to Slide 7. In Welding, demand for capital equipment was down year-over-year as organic revenue declined 10%. However, the commercial business, which accounts for about 35% of revenue and serves primarily smaller businesses and individual users, was up 11%. In industrial, customers were holding back on capital spending, and organic revenue was down more than 20% this quarter. Operating margin, though, was remarkably resilient at 27.9%. On a positive note, Polymers & Fluids reported record organic growth of 6% in the quarter. The automotive aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales to grow 10%, with double-digit growth in tire and engine repair products. Fluids was up 6%, with strong sales in healthcare and hygiene end markets. As a result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 78%, operating margin expanded by 250 basis points to a record 26.6%. Moving to Slide 8. Construction had a remarkable quarter, benefiting from continued strong demand in the home center channel to deliver record organic growth of 8%. All geographies were positive, with North America up 12% with double-digit growth in the residential and renovation market, offset by commercial construction down 10%. Europe was up 6% with double-digit growth in the Nordic region, and Australia and New Zealand revenues grew 3% and were positive for the first time in more than 2 years. As a result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 59%, operating margin expanded by 300 basis points to a record 28.1%. And some of you may remember that when we launched the enterprise strategy in 2012, Construction had the lowest operating margins in the company, seemingly stock right around 12%, certainly good performance in the industry, but not really ITW caliber. The fact that the Construction segment delivered the highest margins inside of ITW in Q3 at more than 28% is, therefore, pretty remarkable. Specialty organic revenue was down 5%, with North America down 4% and international revenue down 7%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid but was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses. Operating margin was 25.2% and included a one-time customer cost-sharing settlement. Excluding the impact of this one-time item, operating margins would have been 28%. Let's move to Slide 9 for an updated look at our full year 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the demand recovery in Q3 exceeded the high end of our expectations going into the quarter, and as a result, we're updating our financial outlook for the year. As we sit here today, we expect organic revenue for the full year to be down 11% to 11.5%, operating margin to be in the range of 22% to 22.5% and operating income in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. As I mentioned, free cash flow performance continues to be strong, and we expect to end the year well above $2 billion. As you think about Q4, keep in mind the typical seasonality from Q3 to Q4 and that Q4 has 2 less shipping days. Also, please note that we expect a slightly higher tax rate in Q4 versus Q3 and our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 22% to 23% range. With respect to our outlook for 2021, we expect to reinstate annual guidance when we release full year 2020 results early next year.  With that, Karen, back to you.\nKaren Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. Julienne, let's open up the lines for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook : I guess two questions, sort of one strategically as we're getting through COVID, can you sort of speak to where you had a good opportunity to grow faster than the market or where you -- which markets do you see best positioned to grow faster than the market as you sort of take advantage of the opportunity right now and update on how the M&A is trending? And then I guess my second question, as we think about 2021, understanding you don't want to talk about incrementals yet outside of volumes. Is there anything that you can help us with headwinds versus tailwinds? I guess you don't have some of the salary cuts that other people will be comping or structuring. I'm just trying to think of the puts and takes and your ability to put up outsized incrementals.\nScott Santi: Well, maybe let me take the sort of strategic questions and then ask Michael to comment on your second question. What I would say overall is this is very much a dynamic situation that's still playing its way out. We are certainly responding from a tactical standpoint, pretty well at this point. Our ability to remain invested is certainly and with the mission of focusing on, making sure we serve our customers extremely well through this period and also that we are in position to seize opportunities that come our way. We remain focused on that. I think at this point, it's way too early to sort out the sort of priorities of the rank order of opportunities other than -- I'll refer back to the comment I made in my opening remarks that every 1 of our segments can point to solid examples in the third quarter of where their ability to have immediate availability to respond to a customer need resulted in incremental business for the company. It remains a priority, but I think the situation in the near-term is just too dynamic in terms of having any real view at this point of what parts of the company have more opportunity than others. But I think the thing we want to be clear about is we are focused on it and expect those opportunities to continue to play out as we go forward. From an M&A perspective, although I would really say at this point is what we've said in the past is from the standpoint of the long-term strategy of the company, we remain very open to the good opportunities that come our way. But I would also marry that up with the fact that in this environment, sort of the flip side of our own experience on the divestitures, this is not a particularly good time for quality business to sell. We're not in the market for discussed assets. We're interested in bringing quality companies into the company, into ITW that we think we can at fit our strategy and ultimately, that we can help even better companies. And in this kind of environment, this is not necessarily a great time to sell. So on a medium to long-term basis, as we have said repeatedly in prior forums, it remains a core part of the overall growth strategy and profile of the company. But from a tactical standpoint, short-term, it's not a big focus right now.\nMichael Larsen : And then on your second question, Jamie, as we've talked about before, the planning process inside of ITW is very much a bottoms-up planning process, and we simply haven't gotten through that process yet with our businesses. And so I can't really comment in great detail. I will -- I promise that when we provide guidance on our next earnings call, I'll be able to address your specific questions in a lot of detail. And then I'll just point to the obvious ones at this point that the comparisons in terms of year-over-year growth are obviously what they are, which is fairly easy. And then specific to your question around incrementals, our long-term incrementals are still in that 35% to 40% range. I will say that, as you saw this quarter, in both Polymers & Fluids and Construction that when we get a reasonable amount of organic growth, the incremental margins tend to be significantly higher. It's certainly in the near term. And so you may see some of that when we get into detail for 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Inch: Hey, Scott, what are you and your auto team saying toward the prospects to return to sustainable growth in North America and Europe? In other words, how much pent-up demand cyclically is creating for a runway do you think beyond sort of a quarter or two of what the pent-up stuff for kind of backtracking? And I'm just wondering if you also think -- a couple of companies have commented on this, and it seems intuitive. The public is avoiding mass transit in big cities and driving more as they did in China during their experience. Do you think that adds some juice to the potential recovery in auto next year?\nScott Santi : Certainly, potentially, I would say our thinking on that is not yet particularly deep. We're still in the tactical mode. I think beyond what you -- the situation that you just talked about or the shift in demand related to this COVID experience on a medium basis that might result from what you talked about there, we also are looking at dealer inventories that remain at 5-year plus lows. There's certainly -- so I don't know that in our own thinking, we're sort of out -- yet, long-term, we'll do some of that as part of our planning process. And as we think about how to -- we want to adjust our positioning around that sort of trend long-term. But I do think that based on just the sort of more current conditions in the marketplace that certainly Q4 we expect to be solid and into Q1 at this point. And then -- and we'll have a better view when we announce our results and have our 2022 plans -- 2021 and '22 plans baked in early January.\nJohn Inch : That's fair. I just wanted to also just follow that up and stick with the auto theme. I've got a couple of context of OEs. And what they tell me is right now, there's pretty substantial problems with supplier quality. A lot of it may actually have to do with the fact that a lot of workers are booking off time, and they're just not coming into work. And it's creating a lot of stress in the system for requirements for the OEs to work overtime and do rework and stuff like that. Is this -- firstly, are you seeing quality issues with respect to your own supply chain who feed ITW's plans? And secondly, is this actually, I'm wondering, creating an opportunity because you guys can leverage 80/20 to drive some incremental share just based on the fact that you can fulfill with quality versus perhaps what others are doing? I realize your auto business is kind of program-by-program. So that's why I'm kind of asking the question. You're not Delphi or whatever. Just -- there's something going on there.\nScott Santi : No, it's program-by-program, but we are not sole-sourced in a lot of the programs that we participate in. So certainly, some of the issues that you talked about were absolutely present, and we're part of our overall results in auto in the third quarter, and we expect that to certainly continue to be an incremental opportunity. There are certainly lots of parts of the auto OE supply chain that we don't participate in. So we're not going to solve the problem. But certainly, in the areas that we serve our customers, we are laser-focused on making sure they're aware that we stay in -- that we remain in a very strong supply position that we're there to help them to the best of our ability, deal with some of the issues that you talked about. And from a quality standpoint, we've talked in the past about the fact that this company operates with localized supply chains, strong commitments to long-term relationships with our key suppliers. And going back to the second quarter, our plan throughout has been to make sure that we -- that supply chain for us remains in position, robust and ready to flex with us. That's not a new thing for us, that's inherent in our business model and the way we operate. And so far, I actually should have probably also thank our supply base in my opening comments because they've been remarkable to-date.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell : Maybe a question first for Michael, just around the free cash flow outlook. I think you've mentioned on the previous call that you should have a big step down in second half free cash, $600 million or so. But in Q3, certainly, the free cash flow looking pretty robust. So just wondered if you had any updated thoughts around sort of working capital management and what kind of pressures that could put on the cash flow? And how well do you think you're managing that working capital now as the sales are starting to improve?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. It's a good question, Julian. I mean I think as a result of the fact that the recovery progressed ahead of our expectations into the quarter, our free cash flow performance was also significantly better than what we expected going into the quarter. And we expect something similar here in the fourth quarter. Like I said, year-to-date, we're at $1.9 billion. And we should end the year significantly above $2 billion. I will say this, I think that the working capital performance inside the company, given the recovery in Q3 was pretty remarkable, the teams did an excellent job focusing on -- particularly on the receivables side.  Early on, we put some focus on our credit and collection efforts. And as a result of that, if you look at our -- you can\u2019t see that from the outside, but inside the company, when you look at our past due performance, we are right in line with where we are historically, which given the pressures here during the pandemic is quite remarkable. So you should expect Julian continued strong free cash flow performance, and we expect to end the year well above 100% as we -- if things stay the way they are here in the fourth quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: And then just a quick follow-up, perhaps for Scott. You mentioned the very low inventories in the Auto OEM vertical. Just wondered, looking across the disparate portfolio at ITW, how do you characterize the state of inventories at channel partners and customers when you're looking at the other businesses, are you seeing much restocking, for example, in general?\nScott Santi : Yes. We've talked about this in the past. We have very little visibility there. The auto comment I made was more around dealer inventories, which is obviously a step or move and their approaches there are certainly their own and it's a number that's reported and is obviously very visible.  In terms of most of our other channel partners, given the fact that you order from us today, we ship it to you tomorrow, there's very little buffer in terms of inventory. So I think from the standpoint of destock-restock, it's not a big factor for us really ever.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Casey: A question on the outlook, if I take the midpoint of the numbers that you provided, it seems to imply Q4 revenue kind of flattish with both Q3 and last year. But the margins are expected, if I'm doing the math right, to decline to about 22% to 23% from Q3 to just to $25.3 million and then last year\u2019s 23.8%. Is that entirely mix or should we consider something else?\nScott Santi : Yes. I think the major driver of the guidance we're providing or the framework we're planning for Q4 is really the fact that if you go back and look historically, Q4 is -- tends to be lower than Q3 from a revenue and margin standpoint, really primarily as a result of the fact that there are 2 less shipping days in the fourth quarter. What I can tell you in terms of the underlying sales trends, that we -- obviously, significant sequential improvement here in -- as we went through the third quarter, those have remained on trend as we sit here in October. So that's certainly encouraging. And then the margin performance, again, it's -- you should -- there's nothing unusual here in the fourth quarter.  I will say that I pointed to some one-time items here in the third quarter. Obviously, we don't expect those to repeat in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, we've provided enough information here for you to put together your own view of what the fourth quarter might look like with your own assumptions. But what's reflected on the page in the deck is really our current view as we sit here today for the full year.\nAndy Casey : Okay. And then if I may, last quarter, you gave us some information about market share win benefit to annualized revenue. Would you be willing to share where the company stands on that metric, meaning did it increase this past quarter? And if so, by magnitude, about how much?\nScott Santi: Yes. I think what we gave you last quarter was just a couple of 2 or 3 real examples that had already started to play out as we were reporting our results. This is not a list that we're keeping inside the company. This is certainly a major focus across all 7 of our segments. I guarantee that our segments are tracking it very diligently. But at this point, I would assume that certainly continuing to broaden out and it would just be impossible given the thousands and thousands of customers that we have that if we were keeping a running tab of all this stuff and reporting on and it just wouldn't -- it wouldn't be practical nor would it be accurate, probably.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Scott or Michael, if you look at a couple of your segments in the quarter, such as Construction or Polymers & Fluids, the growth rates we rarely ever see in these segments, we know much of the growth is coming from strength, for instance, in construction renovation or auto aftermarket. But you've also done a lot of PLS in these segments which you mentioned are helping the margin side. So are we also seeing the fruits of the labor on the revenue side, too? Or is this just pandemic-related recovery? What could that mean for the sustainability of growth in these particular segments in 2021?\nScott Santi : Yes. My answer to Andy is that some of both. There are certainly certain market sectors or product categories within both of those segments that are benefiting from some pandemic-related demand. We actually talked about that very question with the leaders of both of those businesses. And beyond those sort of pandemic-related benefits in the near-term, both of their results also reflect a solid progress in terms of improving the overall growth posture and profile in those two segments.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Scott, that's helpful. And then maybe about Food Equipment, could you give us more color in the sense you mentioned institutional was up -- was down 30% with restaurant down a little more than that, but grocery stores were up 30%. As you look out over the next few quarters, do you see continued recovery in institutional and sustained strength in grocery? And can you see your Food Equipment sales continue to recover if the restaurant facing portion of the business stays weak?\nScott Santi: Yes. And so we think that the recovery will probably be on the slow side of things. It will take a while. As you look across the portfolio, Food Equipment is probably the segment where the recovery for obvious reasons will take a little bit longer. Yes, I can give you a little bit of detail maybe on the quarter in terms of the end markets. The institutional side, down about 30%, which was the same as in the second quarter. Within that, healthcare is doing slightly better. And the drag really is on the lodging side, as you might expect. Restaurants, QSR did improve sequentially versus the second quarter. And then obviously, a big improvement here on the retail side. Supported -- part of that was market and part of it was new product rollout share gain. And so that's why that business was up almost 40% on the retail side. But to answer your question, this will be -- as we sit here today, we think this will be a fairly slow recovery in Food Equipment. In the near term -- I think in the long-term, our view hasn't changed in terms of how attractive this business is, both in terms of our ability to grow above market and our ability to do so at a very attractive margin. And I think you saw in the quarter here for this business to already be back at 20% operating margin and generating $90 million of income, given the environment that they're dealing with. It's a pretty remarkable accomplishment. So near term, slow, but long-term, we are very bullish on this business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAnn Duignan: Most of the short-term questions have been answered at this point. I thought maybe I could ask about the Automotive business in terms of what you're seeing out there for future programs. I know you bid on platforms many years in advance. And are you beginning to see more RFQs or RFPs coming out for electric vehicles and electric platforms? And how does that change the dynamics within the team, especially maybe in Europe ahead of the U.S.?\nScott Santi : Yes. I'd say a couple of things. In terms of new program activity, generally, things certainly got pushed out as the -- just based on the pandemic impact. And so a lot of that activity in the second quarter pretty much disappeared as you would expect, but then in the third quarter has picked up nicely in terms of our engagement with our customers around their future platforms and areas of opportunity for us to participate. And we've talked about the -- on the EV question, we've talked about that a lot. We remain pretty agnostic from the standpoint of internal combustion versus EV from the standpoint of the overall opportunity profile for ITW in terms of the types of solutions where we can add value. In fact, it's still slightly higher on EV on a per vehicle basis. And as you would expect, on a relative basis, it's not as big as the volume of projects on the internal combustion side at this point, but certainly from the standpoint of the growth in the number of projects that we're engaging on in EV for all the reasons you would expect, that is certainly coming up the curve fast.\nAnn Duignan : And then you talk about China and what you're seeing there beyond just Automotive? We read a lot about what's going on in Automotive in China. But maybe you could talk us through what you're seeing in the other segments in China, specifically?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So maybe just to take a step back. So if you go back to the first quarter, our sales in China were down 24%. In the second quarter here, flat, positive 1%. And then in Q3, as the recovery continued to take hold, that business actually grew 10% year-over-year. Auto is actually not the fastest-growing business in China, but auto was up 15%, and so as was specialty. And then our Polymers & Fluids business was up 30% here in the third quarter in China. And then as you'd expect there's still a slower recovery on the Food Equipment side down kind of in the mid-single-digit range. So -- but certainly encouraging trends and as the recovery continues to take hold in China.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Davis : The results obviously in Construction were really amazing overall. And can you give us a little bit of color on whether you put up those numbers despite maybe some product shortages, where the product shortages? What -- and I guess, kind of a natural follow-up is that what role did the price play in the strong results? I assume you might have been able to get a little bit of price given the supply demand environment.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. And the results in Construction were driven by our ability to supply some of the most demanding customers that we deal with. So there were no shortages. And as Scott said earlier, I mean, I think a lot of credit to the operating team and a lot of credit to our own supply chain, our local supply chains and their ability to respond and meet some really strong activity at -- in the home centers. If you look at -- the residential renovation business was up almost 20% in Q3 after a strong Q2. And so -- but like I said, this was -- because all the way back to our decision I think to not initiate aggressive headcount reductions in Q2 and focus instead of winning the recovery, and that's what you're seeing here in Construction, our ability to supply and take care of customers and do so at record margins, which, by the way, are not driven by price. They're driven by a range of things in this quarter, and particularly, the volume leverage was certainly helpful. The enterprise initiatives continue to contribute in a big way, and price was really not a factor in this.\nScott Davis: Is price something that you generally put through towards kind of the end of the year, most regular cycle on price? Or is it more opportunistic?\nMichael Larsen : Well, it's more a planned process. It's an annual cycle -- yes. It's certainly not something that you -- that we are in a position to be very tactical about it. The goal is to -- Scott offset any raw material cost inflation and there is very little of that in the current environment. And so price was really not, to answer your question, a significant factor here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Golden Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie : Maybe just starting off from just on kind of the near-term and thinking about that 4Q implied growth number. Michael, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that there's going to be 2 less shipping days. I just want to be clear, in the 2 less shipping days, is that on a year-over-year basis? Or is that versus just 3Q? And does that account really for the deceleration?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. It's versus the third quarter. I think there's 64 days in Q3. There are 62 in Q4. And that is exactly the same set up as last year. So on a year-over-year basis, there's no -- and I would add, and it\u2019s very tactical, but some of those shipping days between Christmas and the New Year holiday are typically let's just say not very robust. So I think probably more than 2. \nScott Santi: And I think maybe, Joe, what you're really asking is, are you seeing -- are you implying that things are decelerating? And I think that's certainly not the case. I think we have not seen anything to suggest that things are slowing here in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I want to dig into the Food Equipment segment for a second. You mentioned the retail part of your business was up 30%. And some of that was driven by product rollouts. I'd love a little bit more color on what you're doing there specifically and whether there was any benefit that you saw from just pent-up demand for not being able to potentially shift in 2Q? I'm just trying to understand that 30% number in Food Equipment?\nScott Santi: Yes, some of that. I think in Q2, it was a little difficult to get in there with the product rollouts. But this is part of the annual cycle in Food Equipment where we roll out new products with added features. And so I also think it's -- if you were to ask our team, they would certainly suggest that there were some pretty significant share gains here in the third quarter as a result of these new products being rolled out. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nJeff Sprague: Maybe just 1 more around the kind of short-term tempo. So it looks like you didn't really see any like inventory whipsaw effect. And Scott, you explained clearly how your business operates. But did you get a sense that everybody was caught off guard here in Q3, and there's just a fair amount of catch-up from Q2 and Q3? So it may not be an inventory effect per se, but it's just kind of a snapback that does, in fact, create somewhat down as we move into Q4. It sounds like you're not seeing that yet, but just wondering your kind of antenna on the ground, is there any sense that there's that kind of dynamic that play here?\nScott Santi: This is not going to be a helpful answer, but it's really hard to tell, Jeff. I think at this point, this is obviously a fairly unprecedented situation on so many respects. All we can do is stay in position -- somebody better pet the dog. That's not here. But some of it may very well be a factor. It's just impossible to tell. All we can do is what's within our control, which is to stay in position to serve our customers we're -- third quarter was certainly the first part of the recovery from a completely unprecedented complete shutdown of wide swaths of our customer base and the economy. And so I wouldn't certainly rule out any and all of the above in terms of impacting the conditions right now, and we'll see how they play out from here. But all we can tell you is what -- I back to what Michael said earlier, is at least through -- obviously, through the third quarter and through October, we've seen no pulling back.\nJeff Sprague: Yes, I'm doing my part here to help the economy, you've got a construction guy showing up and my dog is barking at him. So can you also just give us an update on your thinking on share repurchase here? It sounds like M&A is probably sliding to the right. The cash is obviously gushing. It doesn't look like you did anything in the quarter, maybe I'm wrong, but what's your current thinking?\nMichael Larsen : Yes. So at this point, our primary focus is really on running the business and getting our plans together for next year. And so we suspended the buyback back in Q1. We\u2019ve done -- we spent $706 million, somewhere around $167 a share. And we're essentially done for the year. And our focus really is on running the business and getting our plans together. And then when we kind of give you our thoughts on what 2021 might look like, we'll give you an update at that point also on share repurchases.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann : Just a couple of quick follow-ups, if I could. In terms of the strategy to sort of win the recovery, it seems like maybe automotive might be amongst the most fertile ground as you're able to fill orders that maybe competitors can't. And I'm just curious -- maybe it's way too early for this, but is it potentially possible to think about your historical wins relative to the auto build increasing? Is it too early to think about that?\nScott Santi : Well, I think it would be -- I think what I would say Jeff is this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to our customers the value equation -- I'm sorry, Steve, Jeff was the last one here. Sorry, Steve. The dog is still following me. My apologies. The -- what I was saying is I think this is a phenomenal opportunity for us to demonstrate the value equation around ITW's role in the auto OEM supply chain from the standpoint of a comprehensive -- our ability to serve you through thick and through thin. And so I would expect that our customers experience with us through this particular period will certainly be contributing to our ability to -- as we go forward to secure more business based on the sort of full range of the value-add that we can bring, including our ability to supply when things are dicey.\nStephen Volkmann : Okay. Alright. Fair enough. And then just quickly on Specialty Product. I think, Michael, you mentioned something about cost sharing. I'm just curious if there's any detail there, anything we should be thinking about going forward?\nMichael Larsen: This is a one-time item, and it relates to an agreement with a customer that for obvious reasons I can't give you a ton of detail on. I think the important thing, this was a one-time item, and you're not going to see it again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNicole DeBlase : So maybe we can start with just the cadence of the quarter. Did you see continued improvement throughout the quarter? Or was the organic growth kind of similar across each month?\nScott Santi : Yes. I think the sales trends in Q3 were pretty strong right out of the gate in July. I think we talked about that on our last earnings call. And really remain that way through August, September. And so far, what we've seen of October.\nNicole DeBlase : Okay. Okay. Got it. And then just an update on the restructuring. I know that on the last call, you guys kind of noted that you expected to spend around $60 million in the back half. But given that top-line is kind of coming in probably better than you would have expected, is $60 million still the plan for the second half? And if so, can you maybe parse out what was done in 3Q and what you expect to do in the fourth quarter?\nScott Santi : Yes, you're right, Nicole. It's -- we now expect it to be a little bit lower than the $60 million that we talked about on the last call. Let me just -- first that, just a reminder that the projects that we're doing this year are essentially the projects that were in the pre-pandemic plan, if you like. And there's very little specific tied to the pandemic from a restructuring standpoint. And part of the reason for that is, obviously, the recovery is now progressing at least in the third quarter at a pace that exceeded our expectations. So we have done $37 million year-to-date. And we expect to end up somewhere around $50 million for the full year.\nNicole DeBlase : Okay. And that probably means then that you guys were kind of expecting 1 to 1 payback as we think about the impact to 2021. So I also suspect that the stock is more like $50 million for next year. Is that fair?\nScott Santi : Yes. I mean -- I think the payback, as we've talked about before on these projects, and these are really the projects that are coming out of our Front-to-Back process are typically less than 12 months. So that would be a reasonable assumption.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mig Dobre from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMig Dobre : Just a quick question on margin here, especially sort of the margin algorithm going forward. As I'm looking at gross margins, it was very nice to see them above 42% again. And I'm wondering here, just conceptually, as volumes, we get back to volume growth at a point in time, do you see some opportunity to continue to expand, to drive gross margin? Or is this mostly a exercise of leverage on SG&A in terms of driving incremental margin?\nMichael Larsen : Well, I think we've demonstrated over the last 7 years that we have a pretty good track record in terms of continuing to drive improvement in our cost structure, both on the variable side as well as on the SG&A side. So we would expect both. And I should have said this upfront, as we begin to think about 2021, I mean -- and that is -- and the enterprise initiative specifically, they didn't -- we didn't talk a lot about that, but they contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion here in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're above 100 basis points, and we're 7 years into this. And so I think it's certainly a lot of positive momentum going into not just fourth quarter but also into next year, as these enterprise initiatives continue to contribute to our margin improvement in a meaningful way, both variable and on the SG&A side -- on the fixed cost side.\nMig Dobre : And then my follow-up, going back to Welding, and I appreciate the color that you guys gave there. I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more in terms of kind of what you're seeing going forward. Arguably speaking, some of your customers in areas like heavy equipment and such might be seeing some of these production schedules bottom out. Do you have any sense for how demand might progress here? And at what point in time we could be seeing this segment return back to growth?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think, Mig, as you look at Q4, I think Q4 will -- if that's your question, will look a lot like Q3, probably. I think we haven't done the plans yet for next year. And when we get together, next year, we'll give you a little more color by segment, including Welding. But it's really a little too early to tell at this point. So I mean, as I said upfront, the comparisons year-over-year are going to be relatively easy. So just on that basis, that's certainly helpful as we think about next year. But we'll give you a better answer, Mig, when we provide guidance for 2021, okay?\nOperator: Your last question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe : Obviously, you\u2019ve covered a lot of ground here. I did want to go back to restructuring. That $50 million this year, does that support the 100 basis points for next year? Or does that provide some upside potential to that number?\nMichael Larsen : Well, I -- I'm not going to let you pin me down on the number yet for next year because we haven't gone through the specific projects and activities that support that number for next year. But I think it's reasonable to assume a meaningful contribution again next year from our enterprise initiatives, and which includes 80/20 work as well as the work that's being done on the strategic sourcing side. So that's probably the best I can do right now is expect another meaningful contribution from the enterprise initiatives next year.\nNigel Coe : And then a quick one on tools. Obviously, very impressive performance. And I was surprised because I think I'm right in saying that you have exclusively a pro channel that's very limited exposure to there. So it seems like this is all driven by new residential construction. Renovation would have been -- seems still quite anemic. Is that the case? And what are you seeing in terms of new build versus renovation trends?\nMichael Larsen : I think your view let's change your assumptions. So renovation, we've got a lot of exposure. And so our residential construction exposure is bolt-on new and remodel, and the remodel is really where the strength -- a lot of the strength was in Q3.\nScott Santi: Yes. That's exactly right. Just to add maybe a little more color, Nigel, since you had to wait until the end to get your question in. We did see some builder activity also picking up in other parts of the business. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Fletcher for any closing remarks.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Julienne. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Since the beginning of the pandemic, maintaining ITW's considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality has been a priority. Our objective was to fully leverage the strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile that we have built over the last 7 years to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. And as the recovery progressed ahead of our expectations going into the quarter, we were ready to meet customer demand, and we delivered strong financial results.  Q3 revenue was up 29% or almost $750 million sequentially versus Q2. And on a year-over-year basis, organic revenue declined only 4.6% compared to a 27% decline in Q2. The impact of last year's divestitures was 1% and was essentially offset by 0.7% of favorable currency impact. Product line simplification was 30 basis points in the quarter. Despite the negative volume leverage and our decision to stay invested in our key strategic priorities, Q3 operating margin was 23.8%, down only 120 basis points compared to prior year. If you set aside the impact of higher restructuring expenses and 2 one-time segment items that I will describe in a moment, operating margin would actually have increased year-over-year to 25.3%. Strong execution on our enterprise initiatives was a big contributor once again at 120 basis points as all segments delivered benefits in the range of 70 basis points to 190 basis points. As expected, our decremental margins were a little higher than normal at 46% in the third quarter. Excluding the 2 one-time items that I just mentioned and the higher restructuring expense, our decremental margins would have been about 20%, significantly better than our historical decrementals of 35% to 40%. Operating income was $789 million and GAAP EPS was $1.83, with an effective tax rate of 21.3%, in line with last year's 21.6%. Solid working capital performance contributed to free cash flow of $631 million and a conversion rate of 108% of net income. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was $1.9 billion, with a conversion rate of 127% compared to 105% last year. We now expect free cash flow to end the year significantly above $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong. At quarter end, we had $2.2 billion of cash on hand, no commercial paper and a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.7 billion. In terms of our debt structure, you can see an increase of $350 million in the short-term debt, which is simply a reclassification from long-term to short-term as our 2021 bonds are coming due in less than 12 months. So in summary, a very good quarter operationally and financially as the recovery progressed well ahead of our previous expectations. Moving on to Slide 4 for a closer look at the third quarter recovery and response by each segment. You can see that every segment responded effectively to the increase in demand recovery and improved sequentially on both revenues and operating margin. I would highlight just a few things that Scott mentioned, including the fact that our Automotive OEM segment was able to essentially double their volumes in a quarter or just 90 days as operating margins swung from negative to 20% plus. In addition, 6 of 7 segments had operating margins, not segment margins, operating margins above 20%. FEG, Food Equipment was just below 20%, but we expect them to get above 20% in Q4 despite the fact that they are operating in a pretty challenging environment. Next to Slide 5, starting with a quick look at organic revenue by geography. As you can see, customer demand improved in every region. North America declined by only 5% in Q3 compared to down 26% in Q2. Europe also improved significantly, down only 8%, a sequential improvement of almost 30 percentage points. Asia Pacific turned positive this quarter, up 3%; and China was the standout, up 10% as the recovery continued to take hold. In China, specifically, Automotive OEM, Polymers & Fluids, and Specialty Products, all grew double-digits. So in summary, broad-based geographic recovery in the quarter. Now let's walk through each segment, starting with the one that experienced the most pronounced recovery, Automotive OEM. In a matter of weeks, our customers went from being shut down to operating close to full capacity and the team responded by leveraging their experienced workforce, local supply chains and flexible operating system to quickly ramp up and meet customer demand. Overall, organic revenue was still down 5% year-over-year, with North America down 10% and Europe down 5%. China, which had already turned positive last quarter at 6%, also improved sequentially and was up 15% this quarter. Lastly, as we discussed on our last call, we did initiate a few restructuring projects that were part of our 2020 plan pre-pandemic which led to a reduction in operating margins of 150 basis points to 20.8%. Turning to Slide 6. As expected, Food Equipment was the hardest hit segment in the quarter as organic revenue declined 20%, a significant improvement, though, from being down 38% in Q2. North America and international organic revenue were both down about 20%. Equipment sales were down 21% and service was down 17%. Institutional demand was down about 30% and restaurants, including QSR, were down a little bit more than that. On a positive note, retail, which includes grocery stores, grew more than 30% supported by the rollout of new products. Despite the significant negative volume leverage and higher restructuring expense, operating margin was still 19.6%. Excluding the higher restructuring impact, margins would have been 21.4%. And I think it's worth noting that in this most challenging environment, the segment generated almost $19 million in operating income. In Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue declined only 2%, with Test & Measurement down 6% and Electronics up 2%. While demand for capital equipment remains soft, the segment benefited from considerable strength in a number of end markets, including semiconductor, healthcare and clean room technology. As you can see from the footnote, the reported operating margin of 23.7% included 350 basis points of unfavorable impact from removing a potential divestiture from assets held-for-sale. Excluding this impact, the operating margin would have been 27.2%, which is a much more accurate representation of the underlying profitability of this segment. Given the current environment, we simply decided to defer this divestiture for now. Speaking of divestitures, let me make a broader comment on our portfolio management efforts and specifically the 2018 decision to divest 7 businesses that we determined no longer fit our enterprise strategy framework, with revenue of approximately $1 billion. We expect at that completion of these divestitures will improve our overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and increase enterprise operating margins by 100 basis points. In 2019, we made good progress completing 4 divestitures with revenues of approximately $150 million. And we are seeing the benefits in our financials this year, including 20 basis points of operating margin impact. While the pandemic put a hold on our efforts this year, our view regarding the long-term strategy fit of the remaining divestitures has not changed. Accordingly, we will resume the sale process for these businesses when market conditions normalize. Okay. Turning to Slide 7. In Welding, demand for capital equipment was down year-over-year as organic revenue declined 10%. However, the commercial business, which accounts for about 35% of revenue and serves primarily smaller businesses and individual users, was up 11%. In industrial, customers were holding back on capital spending, and organic revenue was down more than 20% this quarter. Operating margin, though, was remarkably resilient at 27.9%. On a positive note, Polymers & Fluids reported record organic growth of 6% in the quarter. The automotive aftermarket business benefited from strong retail sales to grow 10%, with double-digit growth in tire and engine repair products. Fluids was up 6%, with strong sales in healthcare and hygiene end markets. As a result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 78%, operating margin expanded by 250 basis points to a record 26.6%. Moving to Slide 8. Construction had a remarkable quarter, benefiting from continued strong demand in the home center channel to deliver record organic growth of 8%. All geographies were positive, with North America up 12% with double-digit growth in the residential and renovation market, offset by commercial construction down 10%. Europe was up 6% with double-digit growth in the Nordic region, and Australia and New Zealand revenues grew 3% and were positive for the first time in more than 2 years. As a result of the volume leverage and strong incremental margins of 59%, operating margin expanded by 300 basis points to a record 28.1%. And some of you may remember that when we launched the enterprise strategy in 2012, Construction had the lowest operating margins in the company, seemingly stock right around 12%, certainly good performance in the industry, but not really ITW caliber. The fact that the Construction segment delivered the highest margins inside of ITW in Q3 at more than 28% is, therefore, pretty remarkable. Specialty organic revenue was down 5%, with North America down 4% and international revenue down 7%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid but was offset by lower demand in the capital equipment businesses. Operating margin was 25.2% and included a one-time customer cost-sharing settlement. Excluding the impact of this one-time item, operating margins would have been 28%. Let's move to Slide 9 for an updated look at our full year 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the demand recovery in Q3 exceeded the high end of our expectations going into the quarter, and as a result, we're updating our financial outlook for the year. As we sit here today, we expect organic revenue for the full year to be down 11% to 11.5%, operating margin to be in the range of 22% to 22.5% and operating income in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion. As I mentioned, free cash flow performance continues to be strong, and we expect to end the year well above $2 billion. As you think about Q4, keep in mind the typical seasonality from Q3 to Q4 and that Q4 has 2 less shipping days. Also, please note that we expect a slightly higher tax rate in Q4 versus Q3 and our full year tax rate is expected to be in the 22% to 23% range. With respect to our outlook for 2021, we expect to reinstate annual guidance when we release full year 2020 results early next year.  With that, Karen, back to you. And then on your second question, Jamie, as we've talked about before, the planning process inside of ITW is very much a bottoms-up planning process, and we simply haven't gotten through that process yet with our businesses. And so I can't really comment in great detail. I will -- I promise that when we provide guidance on our next earnings call, I'll be able to address your specific questions in a lot of detail. And then I'll just point to the obvious ones at this point that the comparisons in terms of year-over-year growth are obviously what they are, which is fairly easy. And then specific to your question around incrementals, our long-term incrementals are still in that 35% to 40% range. I will say that, as you saw this quarter, in both Polymers & Fluids and Construction that when we get a reasonable amount of organic growth, the incremental margins tend to be significantly higher. It's certainly in the near term. And so you may see some of that when we get into detail for 2021. Yes. It's a good question, Julian. I mean I think as a result of the fact that the recovery progressed ahead of our expectations into the quarter, our free cash flow performance was also significantly better than what we expected going into the quarter. And we expect something similar here in the fourth quarter. Like I said, year-to-date, we're at $1.9 billion. And we should end the year significantly above $2 billion. I will say this, I think that the working capital performance inside the company, given the recovery in Q3 was pretty remarkable, the teams did an excellent job focusing on -- particularly on the receivables side.  Early on, we put some focus on our credit and collection efforts. And as a result of that, if you look at our -- you can't see that from the outside, but inside the company, when you look at our past due performance, we are right in line with where we are historically, which given the pressures here during the pandemic is quite remarkable. So you should expect Julian continued strong free cash flow performance, and we expect to end the year well above 100% as we -- if things stay the way they are here in the fourth quarter. Yes. So maybe just to take a step back. So if you go back to the first quarter, our sales in China were down 24%. In the second quarter here, flat, positive 1%. And then in Q3, as the recovery continued to take hold, that business actually grew 10% year-over-year. Auto is actually not the fastest-growing business in China, but auto was up 15%, and so as was specialty. And then our Polymers & Fluids business was up 30% here in the third quarter in China. And then as you'd expect there's still a slower recovery on the Food Equipment side down kind of in the mid-single-digit range. So -- but certainly encouraging trends and as the recovery continues to take hold in China. Yes. And the results in Construction were driven by our ability to supply some of the most demanding customers that we deal with. So there were no shortages. And as Scott said earlier, I mean, I think a lot of credit to the operating team and a lot of credit to our own supply chain, our local supply chains and their ability to respond and meet some really strong activity at -- in the home centers. If you look at -- the residential renovation business was up almost 20% in Q3 after a strong Q2. And so -- but like I said, this was -- because all the way back to our decision I think to not initiate aggressive headcount reductions in Q2 and focus instead of winning the recovery, and that's what you're seeing here in Construction, our ability to supply and take care of customers and do so at record margins, which, by the way, are not driven by price. They're driven by a range of things in this quarter, and particularly, the volume leverage was certainly helpful. The enterprise initiatives continue to contribute in a big way, and price was really not a factor in this. Well, it's more a planned process. It's an annual cycle -- yes. It's certainly not something that you -- that we are in a position to be very tactical about it. The goal is to -- Scott offset any raw material cost inflation and there is very little of that in the current environment. And so price was really not, to answer your question, a significant factor here. Yes. It's versus the third quarter. I think there's 64 days in Q3. There are 62 in Q4. And that is exactly the same set up as last year. So on a year-over-year basis, there's no -- and I would add, and it's very tactical, but some of those shipping days between Christmas and the New Year holiday are typically let's just say not very robust. So I think probably more than 2. Yes. So at this point, our primary focus is really on running the business and getting our plans together for next year. And so we suspended the buyback back in Q1. We've done -- we spent $706 million, somewhere around $167 a share. And we're essentially done for the year. And our focus really is on running the business and getting our plans together. And then when we kind of give you our thoughts on what 2021 might look like, we'll give you an update at that point also on share repurchases. This is a one-time item, and it relates to an agreement with a customer that for obvious reasons I can't give you a ton of detail on. I think the important thing, this was a one-time item, and you're not going to see it again. Well, I think we've demonstrated over the last 7 years that we have a pretty good track record in terms of continuing to drive improvement in our cost structure, both on the variable side as well as on the SG&A side. So we would expect both. And I should have said this upfront, as we begin to think about 2021, I mean -- and that is -- and the enterprise initiative specifically, they didn't -- we didn't talk a lot about that, but they contributed 120 basis points of margin expansion here in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we're above 100 basis points, and we're 7 years into this. And so I think it's certainly a lot of positive momentum going into not just fourth quarter but also into next year, as these enterprise initiatives continue to contribute to our margin improvement in a meaningful way, both variable and on the SG&A side -- on the fixed cost side. Well, I think, Mig, as you look at Q4, I think Q4 will -- if that's your question, will look a lot like Q3, probably. I think we haven't done the plans yet for next year. And when we get together, next year, we'll give you a little more color by segment, including Welding. But it's really a little too early to tell at this point. So I mean, as I said upfront, the comparisons year-over-year are going to be relatively easy. So just on that basis, that's certainly helpful as we think about next year. But we'll give you a better answer, Mig, when we provide guidance for 2021, okay? Well, I -- I'm not going to let you pin me down on the number yet for next year because we haven't gone through the specific projects and activities that support that number for next year. But I think it's reasonable to assume a meaningful contribution again next year from our enterprise initiatives, and which includes 80/20 work as well as the work that's being done on the strategic sourcing side. So that's probably the best I can do right now is expect another meaningful contribution from the enterprise initiatives next year. I think your view let's change your assumptions. So renovation, we've got a lot of exposure. And so our residential construction exposure is bolt-on new and remodel, and the remodel is really where the strength -- a lot of the strength was in Q3."

We saw solid recovery progress in many of the end markets that we serve in the third quarter, as evidenced by our revenue being up 29% sequentially versus the second quarter. In fact, demand levels returned to rates approximating year ago levels in five of our seven segments, with two of those, Construction and Polymers & Fluids delivering meaningful growth in the third quarter.  On the flip side, demand levels in our Food Equipment and Welding segments continued to be materially impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we did see good sequential improvement in both in Q3 versus Q2. We talk often about the flexibility and responsiveness inherent in our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system. And those attributes were clearly on display in our Q3 performance. Supported by our decision early on as the pandemic unfolded to refrain from initiating staffing reductions and to focus on positioning the company to fully participate in the recovery, our people around the world responded to a rapid acceleration in demand by leveraging the ITW business model to provide excellent service to our customers, while keeping themselves and their coworkers safe. Perhaps the most pronounced example was our Auto OEM segment, where our team executed flawlessly from both a quality and delivery standpoint in responding to demand levels that essentially doubled in Q3 versus Q2, and with a demand -- a very demanding customer base. Across all seven of our segments, our teams can cite numerous examples of how our ability to sustain high levels of service in the face of rapidly accelerating demand resulted in incremental business for the company in Q3. In addition to leveraging our best-in-class delivery capabilities, our divisions remain laser-focused on leveraging our strengths to capture sustainable share gain opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy. These efforts are just beginning to take hold. And I'm confident that they will contribute meaningfully to accelerating our progress towards our long-term organic growth goals. The operating flexibility that is core to our 80/20 Front-to-Back operating system also applies to our cost structure, which showed through our operating margin performance in Q3. Operating margin of 23.8% in the quarter included meaningfully higher restructuring expenses versus a year ago in two segments specific one-time items which Michael will provide more detail on in a few minutes. Excluding these factors, operating margin was 25.3% in Q3, the second highest in the history of the company. Overall, the pace of recovery in the third quarter exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter, as we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, operating income of $789 million, free cash flow $631 million and GAAP EPS of $1.83. In addition, after tax return on invested capital improved to 29.6%, an all-time high for the company. It goes without saying that I could not be more proud of how the ITW team is managing through this challenging period. And I want to sincerely thank my 45,000 plus ITW colleagues around the world for their continued exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence. In the face of unprecedented challenges and circumstances, our operational and financial performance over the last few quarters supports our decision to remain fully invested in the key initiatives supporting the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy and provides further evidence that ITW is a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resilience necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment. Moving forward, we remain focused on delivering strong results while continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for more detail on our Q3 performance. Michael? Well, maybe let me take the sort of strategic questions and then ask Michael to comment on your second question. What I would say overall is this is very much a dynamic situation that's still playing its way out. We are certainly responding from a tactical standpoint, pretty well at this point. Our ability to remain invested is certainly and with the mission of focusing on, making sure we serve our customers extremely well through this period and also that we are in position to seize opportunities that come our way. We remain focused on that. I think at this point, it's way too early to sort out the sort of priorities of the rank order of opportunities other than -- I'll refer back to the comment I made in my opening remarks that every 1 of our segments can point to solid examples in the third quarter of where their ability to have immediate availability to respond to a customer need resulted in incremental business for the company. It remains a priority, but I think the situation in the near-term is just too dynamic in terms of having any real view at this point of what parts of the company have more opportunity than others. But I think the thing we want to be clear about is we are focused on it and expect those opportunities to continue to play out as we go forward. From an M&A perspective, although I would really say at this point is what we've said in the past is from the standpoint of the long-term strategy of the company, we remain very open to the good opportunities that come our way. But I would also marry that up with the fact that in this environment, sort of the flip side of our own experience on the divestitures, this is not a particularly good time for quality business to sell. We're not in the market for discussed assets. We're interested in bringing quality companies into the company, into ITW that we think we can at fit our strategy and ultimately, that we can help even better companies. And in this kind of environment, this is not necessarily a great time to sell. So on a medium to long-term basis, as we have said repeatedly in prior forums, it remains a core part of the overall growth strategy and profile of the company. But from a tactical standpoint, short-term, it's not a big focus right now. Certainly, potentially, I would say our thinking on that is not yet particularly deep. We're still in the tactical mode. I think beyond what you -- the situation that you just talked about or the shift in demand related to this COVID experience on a medium basis that might result from what you talked about there, we also are looking at dealer inventories that remain at 5-year plus lows. There's certainly -- so I don't know that in our own thinking, we're sort of out -- yet, long-term, we'll do some of that as part of our planning process. And as we think about how to -- we want to adjust our positioning around that sort of trend long-term. But I do think that based on just the sort of more current conditions in the marketplace that certainly Q4 we expect to be solid and into Q1 at this point. And then -- and we'll have a better view when we announce our results and have our 2022 plans -- 2021 and '22 plans baked in early January. No, it's program-by-program, but we are not sole-sourced in a lot of the programs that we participate in. So certainly, some of the issues that you talked about were absolutely present, and we're part of our overall results in auto in the third quarter, and we expect that to certainly continue to be an incremental opportunity. There are certainly lots of parts of the auto OE supply chain that we don't participate in. So we're not going to solve the problem. But certainly, in the areas that we serve our customers, we are laser-focused on making sure they're aware that we stay in -- that we remain in a very strong supply position that we're there to help them to the best of our ability, deal with some of the issues that you talked about. And from a quality standpoint, we've talked in the past about the fact that this company operates with localized supply chains, strong commitments to long-term relationships with our key suppliers. And going back to the second quarter, our plan throughout has been to make sure that we -- that supply chain for us remains in position, robust and ready to flex with us. That's not a new thing for us, that's inherent in our business model and the way we operate. And so far, I actually should have probably also thank our supply base in my opening comments because they've been remarkable to-date. Yes. We've talked about this in the past. We have very little visibility there. The auto comment I made was more around dealer inventories, which is obviously a step or move and their approaches there are certainly their own and it's a number that's reported and is obviously very visible.  In terms of most of our other channel partners, given the fact that you order from us today, we ship it to you tomorrow, there's very little buffer in terms of inventory. So I think from the standpoint of destock-restock, it's not a big factor for us really ever. Yes. I think the major driver of the guidance we're providing or the framework we're planning for Q4 is really the fact that if you go back and look historically, Q4 is -- tends to be lower than Q3 from a revenue and margin standpoint, really primarily as a result of the fact that there are 2 less shipping days in the fourth quarter. What I can tell you in terms of the underlying sales trends, that we -- obviously, significant sequential improvement here in -- as we went through the third quarter, those have remained on trend as we sit here in October. So that's certainly encouraging. And then the margin performance, again, it's -- you should -- there's nothing unusual here in the fourth quarter.  I will say that I pointed to some one-time items here in the third quarter. Obviously, we don't expect those to repeat in the fourth quarter. So hopefully, we've provided enough information here for you to put together your own view of what the fourth quarter might look like with your own assumptions. But what's reflected on the page in the deck is really our current view as we sit here today for the full year. Yes. I think what we gave you last quarter was just a couple of 2 or 3 real examples that had already started to play out as we were reporting our results. This is not a list that we're keeping inside the company. This is certainly a major focus across all 7 of our segments. I guarantee that our segments are tracking it very diligently. But at this point, I would assume that certainly continuing to broaden out and it would just be impossible given the thousands and thousands of customers that we have that if we were keeping a running tab of all this stuff and reporting on and it just wouldn't -- it wouldn't be practical nor would it be accurate, probably. Yes. My answer to Andy is that some of both. There are certainly certain market sectors or product categories within both of those segments that are benefiting from some pandemic-related demand. We actually talked about that very question with the leaders of both of those businesses. And beyond those sort of pandemic-related benefits in the near-term, both of their results also reflect a solid progress in terms of improving the overall growth posture and profile in those two segments. Yes. And so we think that the recovery will probably be on the slow side of things. It will take a while. As you look across the portfolio, Food Equipment is probably the segment where the recovery for obvious reasons will take a little bit longer. Yes, I can give you a little bit of detail maybe on the quarter in terms of the end markets. The institutional side, down about 30%, which was the same as in the second quarter. Within that, healthcare is doing slightly better. And the drag really is on the lodging side, as you might expect. Restaurants, QSR did improve sequentially versus the second quarter. And then obviously, a big improvement here on the retail side. Supported -- part of that was market and part of it was new product rollout share gain. And so that's why that business was up almost 40% on the retail side. But to answer your question, this will be -- as we sit here today, we think this will be a fairly slow recovery in Food Equipment. In the near term -- I think in the long-term, our view hasn't changed in terms of how attractive this business is, both in terms of our ability to grow above market and our ability to do so at a very attractive margin. And I think you saw in the quarter here for this business to already be back at 20% operating margin and generating $90 million of income, given the environment that they're dealing with. It's a pretty remarkable accomplishment. So near term, slow, but long-term, we are very bullish on this business. Yes. I'd say a couple of things. In terms of new program activity, generally, things certainly got pushed out as the -- just based on the pandemic impact. And so a lot of that activity in the second quarter pretty much disappeared as you would expect, but then in the third quarter has picked up nicely in terms of our engagement with our customers around their future platforms and areas of opportunity for us to participate. And we've talked about the -- on the EV question, we've talked about that a lot. We remain pretty agnostic from the standpoint of internal combustion versus EV from the standpoint of the overall opportunity profile for ITW in terms of the types of solutions where we can add value. In fact, it's still slightly higher on EV on a per vehicle basis. And as you would expect, on a relative basis, it's not as big as the volume of projects on the internal combustion side at this point, but certainly from the standpoint of the growth in the number of projects that we're engaging on in EV for all the reasons you would expect, that is certainly coming up the curve fast. And I think maybe, Joe, what you're really asking is, are you seeing -- are you implying that things are decelerating? And I think that's certainly not the case. I think we have not seen anything to suggest that things are slowing here in the fourth quarter. Yes, some of that. I think in Q2, it was a little difficult to get in there with the product rollouts. But this is part of the annual cycle in Food Equipment where we roll out new products with added features. And so I also think it's -- if you were to ask our team, they would certainly suggest that there were some pretty significant share gains here in the third quarter as a result of these new products being rolled out. So hopefully, that answers your question. This is not going to be a helpful answer, but it's really hard to tell, Jeff. I think at this point, this is obviously a fairly unprecedented situation on so many respects. All we can do is stay in position -- somebody better pet the dog. That's not here. But some of it may very well be a factor. It's just impossible to tell. All we can do is what's within our control, which is to stay in position to serve our customers we're -- third quarter was certainly the first part of the recovery from a completely unprecedented complete shutdown of wide swaths of our customer base and the economy. And so I wouldn't certainly rule out any and all of the above in terms of impacting the conditions right now, and we'll see how they play out from here. But all we can tell you is what -- I back to what Michael said earlier, is at least through -- obviously, through the third quarter and through October, we've seen no pulling back. Well, I think it would be -- I think what I would say Jeff is this gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to our customers the value equation -- I'm sorry, Steve, Jeff was the last one here. Sorry, Steve. The dog is still following me. My apologies. The -- what I was saying is I think this is a phenomenal opportunity for us to demonstrate the value equation around ITW's role in the auto OEM supply chain from the standpoint of a comprehensive -- our ability to serve you through thick and through thin. And so I would expect that our customers experience with us through this particular period will certainly be contributing to our ability to -- as we go forward to secure more business based on the sort of full range of the value-add that we can bring, including our ability to supply when things are dicey. Yes. I think the sales trends in Q3 were pretty strong right out of the gate in July. I think we talked about that on our last earnings call. And really remain that way through August, September. And so far, what we've seen of October. Yes, you're right, Nicole. It's -- we now expect it to be a little bit lower than the $60 million that we talked about on the last call. Let me just -- first that, just a reminder that the projects that we're doing this year are essentially the projects that were in the pre-pandemic plan, if you like. And there's very little specific tied to the pandemic from a restructuring standpoint. And part of the reason for that is, obviously, the recovery is now progressing at least in the third quarter at a pace that exceeded our expectations. So we have done $37 million year-to-date. And we expect to end up somewhere around $50 million for the full year. Yes. I mean -- I think the payback, as we've talked about before on these projects, and these are really the projects that are coming out of our Front-to-Back process are typically less than 12 months. So that would be a reasonable assumption. Yes. That's exactly right. Just to add maybe a little more color, Nigel, since you had to wait until the end to get your question in. We did see some builder activity also picking up in other parts of the business. So hopefully, that's helpful."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For those participating in the Q&A, you'll have an opportunity to ask one question and if needed one follow-up question. Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I'm joined by our; Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter 2020 financial results and provide an update on our strategy for managing through the global pandemic. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Company's 2019 Form 10-K, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risk that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Well, things are far from normal for any of us or our businesses at present. I\u2019m extremely proud of how the ITW team is managing through the unprecedented and challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic. I want to begin by sincerely thanking my ITW colleagues around the world for the effort, dedication and selflessness that they continue to demonstrate daily and protecting the health and safety of their colleagues while continuing to serve our customers with excellence. As I have said many times, the power of the ITW business model and our decentralized entrepreneurial culture are never more valuable than during times of significant and rapid change. And we are leveraging both to position the company to participate across a wide range of recovery scenarios while continuing to execute our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITw\u2019s full potential performance. Over the last seven years, we have made significant progress and executing our strategy to take full advantage of our unique strengths to clearly established ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality and most respected industrial companies. And in doing so building a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resiliency necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment. Well, needless to say the resilience component of that equation is now being tested in ways that were hard for many of us to even imagine six to seven months ago. And as evidenced by our second quarter results, this company in our team of over 45,000 dedicated professionals are rising to the challenge. In the second quarter, in the face of an unprecedented 29% decline in revenues, ITW delivered $449 million in operating income, $681 million in free cash flow, and operating margins of 17.5%. We leveraged our flexible cost structure to reduce operating expenses by more than $140 million without any centralized cause takeout mandate from corporate, while providing full compensation and benefit support to every ITW team member, sustaining investments and key long-term growth strategies, and positioning for full participation in the recovery. As we outlined during our first quarter earnings call, we have an integrated four prong strategy for managing the company through the pandemic. Protect and support our people continue to serve our customers with excellence, maintain our financial strength and strategic optionality and win the recovery. These four priorities comprised the central near-term planning and execution focus for the whole of ITW, and for every one of our operating divisions. We'll come back to them at the end of our presentation. But first let me turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with additional detail on our Q2 performance. Michael over to you.\nMichael Larsen: Okay. Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turned to Slide 5. As Scott mentioned, priority number 3 for managing through the pandemic is to maintain ITW\u2019s considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality. In the second quarter we did just that. And going forward, we will continue to live on that priority. As we leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. On our last earnings call, we shared our expectation for an unprecedented level of demand contraction to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. And indeed, organic revenues declined an unprecedented 27%. As expected, automotive OEM and food equipment were the hardest hit segments. Other segments fared much better, providing another proof point for the benefit of ITW\u2019s diversified high quality business portfolio. At the enterprise level, total revenues declined 29% as organic revenues declined 27% in foreign currency, and last year's divestitures further reduced revenues by about a point each. Nevertheless, our businesses still generated $449 million of operating income and delivered resilient operating margin performance of 17.5% with operating expenses down more than $140 million and enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis point. As expected, free cash flow was strong at $681 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and 213% of net income. Q2 cash flow performance did benefit from the delayed timing of U.S. income tax payments of $158 million, which were paid in the third quarter. Our divisions stepped up to their credit monitoring and collection efforts early in the quarter. And as a result, our receivable performance has continued to remain in line with historical norms. The balance sheet, and our liquidity remained strong throughout the containment phase as we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand, essentially no short-term debt, no commercial paper, a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.3 billion. As expected, ITW had more than enough financial strength and resilience to withstand the shock to the system that the global economy experienced in Q2. We were prepared for it, we managed our way through it effectively. And today we're strongly positioned for the recovery. With that, please turn to Slide 6, for a retrospective look at second quarter revenue, starting with organic revenue by geography. As you can see, the demand contraction with global as North America declined 26%, Europe was down 37%, and Asia Pacific was down 7%. On a positive note, China was up 1% after being down 24% in Q1, as the early phase of their recovery began to take hold. On the right side of the slide, we're sharing average revenue per working day by month. As we move through the quarter, and we compared it to last year, you can see that April was the bottom and then we experienced a sequential acceleration in May. And in June, as the global economy began to reopen. This trend has continued in July. Now, let's go to Slide 7 for segment performance. And on the left side, you can see the most and least affected segments in terms of organic revenue and operating margin. For comparative purposes, I should point out that these margin numbers are fully-loaded on operating margins, not segment margins. It is also notable that five of seven segments delivered operating margins above 20%, despite organic revenue declines ranging from 9% to 25%, and the two segments overcame the significant negative volume leverage to actually expand operating margin year\u2013over-year. Turning to the right side of Slide 7. As expected, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe essentially shutdown in mid-March and only began to restart production in May, June. Our automotive OEM business was the hardest hit. Overall organic revenues were down 53% year-over-year, although we did see a significant uptick in June that is continuing in July. North America was down 62%, Europe down 59% and China was the bright spot with organic revenue up 6%. Importantly, as order production continues to ramp up in Q3, our local close to the customer manufacturing positions remain fully resourced and in position to continue to serve our customers every step of the way, and with the same world class quality and delivery that they have come to expect from us. Turning to Slide 8, also as expected the second hardest segment was food equipment, as organic revenue declined 38%. North America organic revenue was down 33% and international declined 44%. Equipment sales were down 38% and service was down 37%. Institutional sales including healthcare facilities and hospitals were slightly more resilient down about 30%. And not surprisingly, restaurants QSR were down about 45%. Relatively speaking, sales to grocery retail customers held up better, down only 14% with some equipment orders being pushed out due to COVID concerns and retail service sales were flat with prior year. Test & Measurement and Electronics, Organic revenue declined 11% with Test & Measurement down 12% and Electronics down 9%. While demand for CapEx Equipment dropped sales were up double-digits in end markets tied to semiconductor healthcare and clean room technology. And despite negative volume leverage, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.7% with excellent cost management and enterprise initiatives as the main contributors. Turning to Slide 9. In Welding demand slowed significantly, as organic revenue declined by 25% with Equipment sales down 28% and Consumables down 21%. Industrial end markets declined 40% while commercial end markets were fairly resilient, down only 11%. That said despite a 29% of [higher] Revenues Q2 operating margin was 21.6%. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue was down 14%. Polymers was down 20% in line with industrial and MRO trends. Auto aftermarket was down 14% with retail sales improving in a meaningful way as stores open back up as the quarter progressed. Fluids had the best performance with organic revenue down only 5% held by product sales into health and hygiene end markets. Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 23.1% driven by enterprise initiatives and strong tactical cost management. Moving to Slide 10, Construction, organic revenue was down 9% with North America which is almost half of the segment, up 1% with double-digit growth in the residential renovation market served through the home center channel. This strength was partially offset by a 21% decline in the North America commercial business and internationally as Europe was down 28%, reflecting a more restrictive quarantine protocol. Australia and New Zealand sales were down only 3%. Specialty organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 15% and the international side down 19%. Demand for consumables in our consumer packaging businesses such as Zip-Pak were up double-digits offset by orders for packaging equipment being pushed out and some lower sales into the appliance and aviation industry. So let's move to Slide 11 for an update on some full year 2020 performance scenarios. On our last call, we provided three financial scenarios to illustrate the fact that we have the financial strength and margin profile to withstand whatever comes our way over the near-term and therefore, our number 1 priority is positioning to play offense in the recovery. With Q2 in the books, we're updating these scenarios for a key operating metrics, organic revenue, operating margin and operating income. The caveats that will be discussed during our Q1 cost to apply i.e. this is the time of extraordinary and unprecedented uncertainty, and accepting any significant recurrence of major economic shutdowns. As you can see, we are narrowing the range of likely four year outcomes based on our second quarter performance and current demand trends across the company. And what stands out is that in all three scenarios, ITW\u2019s operating performance is strong in terms of operating income and operating margin. And while we're not providing formal guidance as we sit here today, we are tracking closest to the mid scenario. The second half organic revenue is down about 12%, which would translate into a full year organic decline of approximately 14.5% and operating margins of 20% to 22%. And in an unprecedented year like this, should this scenario hold, we would still make somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion of operating income and generate more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow. As demand recovers, we want to be in a strong position to fully support our customers as their businesses begin to re-accelerate. As a result, we expect an increase in working capital and therefore lower free cash flow of about $600 million in the second half of the year. Importantly, though, we're going to make sure that we're in a strong position to both respond to our customers needs, and take share from competitors who can throughout the recovery. As we discussed on the last call, we're going to make some fairly modest capacity and cost structure adjustments based on projects submitted by our division leaders who have now had a chance to better assess the pace and slope of recovery in each of their respective businesses. We currently projected that we will spend about $60 million in restructuring projects in the second half of the year, including $45 billion [indiscernible] to back projects that were already planned for 2020 that we placed on a temporary hold as the early stages of the pandemic unfolded. As a reference, we spent about $80 million on restructuring in 2019. And about $30 million of that was in the second half of the year. It is worth noting that the average payback for these projects is projected to be less than 12 months. Finally, just some a brief comments on capital allocation to let you know that our position has not changed from our last call. First with regard to the dividend we\u2019ve recognize the importance of our dividend to our long-term shareholders. We continue to view it as a critical component of ITW\u2019s total shareholder return model, and we remain strongly committed to the dividend. In terms of strategic optionality we are clearly in a position of strength with ample liquidity and balance sheet capacity and strong credit ratings. We remain open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of a pandemic and we're in a strong position to react to high quality strategic opportunities that are aligned with our enterprise strategy. Lastly, we suspended share repurchases until end market stabilized, and the recovery path becomes clearer. So let's move on to Slide 12. And I'll turn it back over to Scott to share some more thoughts on our recovery phase strategy. Scott, back to you.\nScott Santi: All right. Thank you, Michael. So moving forward, while significant end market disruption and uncertainties remain, we will continue to leverage our financial strength and the performance power of our business model to prioritize playing offense in the recovery over playing defense in the contraction, and to ensure that every one of our businesses is strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery. Job one is to protect our people while continuing to serve our customers with the world class quality and delivery performance that they expect from us. Thus far, our people have done a superb job on both fronts and across the company. We will remain intensely focused on these two mission critical imperatives. Second, we're going to lean in hard to the upside by remaining invested in staff to support anticipated demand two to three quarters out, so that we have ample cushion to both fully support our customers as their businesses re-accelerate and to capture incremental share gain opportunities that we expect might emerge along the way. In that regard core to the recovery planning process in every one of our 84 divisions is the identification and actioning of specific pandemic related share game programs and opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy. Finally, we will leverage our advantaged financial position to sustain the investments we've made to support the execution of our enterprise strategy. We are taking the long view and from that perspective when the recovery is an execution component of our long-term enterprise strategy. It is not a separate strategy. It is about every one of our divisions identifying specific opportunities to aggressively accelerate progress in executing key aspects of their enterprise strategy agenda, due to the effects of the pandemic. Things such as newer changing customer needs, competitors, distress, ability to stay invested, et cetera. In fact, we're already seeing areas of opportunity emerging in our businesses. And these are some of the early themes. First, ITW\u2019s undisrupted ability to supply and deliver during these times of tremendous volatility and disruption is a significant asset. In the last quarter, we landed new programs worth a combined $105 million annually with a handful of key customers based largely on our ability to provide immediate supply. Second, many companies including many of our existing customers are moving away from low cost country sourcing strategies and looking to localize their supply chains in response to risk and challenges exposed first by trade and tariff related disruptions, and now by the effects of the pandemic. Our long standing commitment to local produce where we sell manufacturing has uniquely positioned ITW to support existing and new customers in making this transition. Just recently, one of our businesses was awarded nearly $10 million in new business a result of one of their key customers moving to build more local supply capability. In addition, a number of our automotive OEM customers are implementing strategies to localize their supply chains and we are in a very strong position to support them in this regard. And third, we are already benefiting from remaining committed to our strategic sales excellence and customer back innovation investments. Our ability to stay the course means that the people that we have invested in, in these critical areas remain in place and that they are not distracted by downsizings, reorganizations, top down mandates or shifting priorities. They remain focused on serving customers, seizing new opportunities, and continuing to innovate. It's just one illustration, in the second quarter our new patent filings were up 24% over the last year. So in closing, on behalf of Michael and our entire executive leadership team, we offer our deepest thanks to our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication always, but especially during this period of unprecedented circumstances and challenges. Well, there is obviously a lot that we will have to work our way through in the months ahead. I have no doubt that the strength and resilience of ITW\u2019s business model, our diversified high quality business portfolio and our people position us extremely well to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenge that lie ahead. With that, I'll turn it back to you Karen.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay, thank you, Scott. Julianne, let's open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Well, our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is well.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Same to you Andy. Thanks,\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Scott and Mike, maybe you can help us color on business conditions by region a little more. And China turning positive is encouraging, as you said. But for many companies in Q2, we saw some improvement maybe a little faster in Europe, in the U.S., you guys were down a little bit more in Europe. So maybe you can talk about what held you down in Europe. And then you mentioned you were down about 20% in terms of average daily sales in June, and then you continue to see improvement in July. In terms of the reason to decline did you continue at the same rate of recovery as you saw by month, in Q2 in July?\nScott Santi: Hi, so let\u2019s start with your question on Europe, specifically, which represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and saw as you pointed out there most significant decline year-over-year at 37%. By far, the most significant decline was in the automotive business as you might expect down 59% followed by food equipment down 48% and then construction down 28%. In terms of the kind of the framework that we're providing for the second half year and your question around how the dynamics might play out by region, we're anticipating, again, in a very dynamic environment here, North America and Europe down both in that 10% to 15% range, year-over-year and then Asia Pacific and China as you pointed out better than that flat maybe slightly positive as we look at the second half year. A lot of \u2013 probably the thinking on how the second half plays out ties back to your first, the second question, which was around July and the trends, so. The trends that we saw, sequentially in the second quarter were certainly encouraging April, the bottom acceleration in May, June. And those trends have continued into July. I wouldn't read too much into one month year. I think this remains a really like I said, uncertain environment. And the best way to think about this is really this second half framework that we've provided as you look at how this might play out, but certainly encouraging kind of near-term demand trends that continued into Q2.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Michae, just one follow up on how you thinking about forecasting auto OEM, obviously one of your tougher businesses but, relatively quicker recovery that we're seeing there. You mentioned the shutdowns impacting your business. But is it harder to adjust ITW\u2019s cost base in that business. And in the past, it's been hard to change move pricing around. So that what hurt you in the quarter? And do you expect that business would turn profitable again in Q3?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think the short answer is no. I mean, I think, as you know, we're not an auto company, we're really benefiting in Q2 in the second half from this high quality, highly diversified portfolio. So we don't have to get the forecast 100% right in automotive, because we know we're going to have offsets, one positive or negative and other parts of the company where as you know, we're very much a read and react company. We don't have a lot of backlog. We don't have great visibility. Beyond, two to three weeks in auto for example, but we do have the ability to respond very quickly to changes in demand. We, expect a challenging second half in automotive certainly better than Q3. And then just did we transparent with -- what auto might look like in the second quarter based -- in the second half based on feedback from customers current demand trends, we're looking at being down about 15% in the second half of the year for automotive. Of course, a lot of that depends on how quickly production ramps up what auto sales do in the second half of the year, but maybe that gives you a sense for how that might play out.\nScott Santi: Due to [indiscernible] I would add on the cost side as we were very intentional and that decimating the business and this was the hardest shutdown across our portfolio. And we clearly knew that was going to take place production stops from mid-March through mid-May. And ultimately we made a choice not to do anything that would impair that we also expected that once that those hard shutdowns were over that things would recover. Maybe not certainly not back to their prior demand levels but a long way from zero, which is where they were for those 60 days or so. So I think there was a lot of intention in -- if your reference point is to the fact we lost money in that business that was, we certainly could have mitigated some of that if we wanted to worry about that. But ultimately, our decision and our biggest concern was making sure that we were there to support our customers on the other side of that.\nMichael Larsen: And maybe just to -- you asked around what the second half might look like profitability we fully expect based on what we're seeing now that the business will be profitable in the second half and we will be returning to double-digit margins as we go through the year. This beginning recovery here in automotive.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks, guys. Stay well.\nScott Santi: You too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Can you hear me? Okay?\nScott Santi: Yes. Good morning, Jamie.\nJamie Cook: Okay, I guess just my first question. Can you just talk about any of the question on auto food was also the business that was hit harder. So can you just talk about the margin trajectories as we think about the second half of the year in that business. And then I guess my follow up question just is sort of on the market share opportunity. Can you talk about sort of early conversations with customers, if you think you'll be able to gain market share? And is that embedded, as you think about sort of the sales outlook for the back half of the year? Thanks.\nScott Santi: Yes, so specific on food, we\u2019ll probably be the hardest hit segment here in the second half of the year. We're looking at potentially being down somewhere around 25%. But even with that sort of kind of unprecedented decline, we expect that business to continue to be profitable. And we expect margins to continue to improve from where they were in Q2 and being back into double-digit territory here in Q3 and Q4.\nMichael Larsen: I think in terms of market share rather than talking about specific customers, I think I'd go back to the themes that Scott talked about the fact that we have a high degree of confidence that they are real market share opportunities and their discussions with customers that are taking place every day and every single one of our divisions and we pointed to over $100 million of new business generated here in the second quarter just as a result of that the first element, which is our ability to continue to supply and deliver for existing and for new customers. So I think we -- that's, that's maybe how we think about the market share opportunities.\nScott Santi: Yes. I think and I think the only thing I would add, Jamie, is it just in terms of impact on the balance of the year? We're not really that -- focused on that. We're looking for long-term opportunities that are sustainable ultimately the programs that I referenced will that have some incremental benefit in the back half, sure. But ultimately, we're not looking so I guess the point I'm trying to make is we're not looking for quick hits that are opportunistic. We're looking for opportunities to move faster on opportunities that we would want even in normal times, and expected certainly based on the second quarter, but certainly optimistic that those will continue to pop up as we move forward.\nJamie Cook: Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hi, good morning, guys.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Couple of questions here, but Tests & Measurement margins were strong whether they're mix any support on mix there? Was it restructuring that the guys are doing on a localized basis so it\u2019s really quite remarkable to have mid 20s margins in a revenue environment like this?\nScott Santi: Yes, I think it's -- I think I may have mentioned this, it's the continued execution on the enterprise initiatives contributing in a meaningful way to the all front-to-back projects really it carryover from last year since we put a halt on restructuring especially in the first half of the year. And then just really good, tactical, management of our operating expenses $140 million at the total company level and every -- in every segment, including in Test & Measurements, so. And then I think the other thing -- I wanted their top line was maybe a little more resilient than some of the other segments. We talked about the strength in semi healthcare clean room technology, and they certainly benefited in Test & Measurement.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a follow up, I mean in such a big demand hit in a couple of your businesses, obviously, but how many of your own facilities remain idle there? They are most -- I mean, I'd say they all back up and running in some level of capacity or do you still have a number of facilities that are 100% shut down?\nScott Santi: We are essentially 100% open and all of our divisions are serving customer needs at this point, so.\nScott Davis: Around the world.\nScott Santi: Around the world, yes.\nScott Davis: Okay. Super. Thank you guys.\nScott Santi: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nJohn Inch: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey, Michael did July I know it's not going to be definitive, but it is still exhibiting uptrend in terms of average daily sales? And are we both thinking about sort of the potential for channel restocking, kind of given the way markets have transcended and your own commentary for expectations around the back half?\nMichael Larsen: So, the first part, July is up sequentially from June to answer your question. I think in terms of the channel, we've talked about this before, John. We really given how short cycle we are and how our businesses are set up, really we're talking about very little backlog, we get the order today, we ship tomorrow we replenish the inventory the day after, we don't have great visibility to what the channel has in terms of inventory. They don't need to carry it out of inventory, because they know that if they place the order with us, we're shipping it tomorrow. So, it's not really a big driver in terms of how our sales might be reacting here.\nJohn Inch: Even in say construction products, I'm just -- I agree with you, obviously, but I was just curious if there might have been a little bit of pre-emptive build or anticipated build in the back half or something like that.\nMichael Larsen: No, we really don't need to and that's construction, every segment every division is run the same way here so, so the answer is no.\nJohn Inch: Okay, and then how are you guys thinking about the $140 million of cost saves, which is actually pretty impressive considering that we didn't touch employee comp. How are you thinking about that? Michael and Scott, maybe bleeding back into the organization this will be matched against kind of revenues. So you kind of keep the costs in check or how are you thinking about sort of the cadence of those jobs coming back over the course of the second half of next year?\nScott Santi: Yes, John, everything other than the structural costs that we have already planned to take out this year, which are the kind of the front-to-back savings, those are structural savings, but everything else is essentially temporary. And so this was our response to current levels of demand as the recovery continues to take hold you in the second half of the year, the majority of these costs will come back in again. Certainly, we'll continue to remain our divisions, disciplined and focused in terms of cost management, but these are essentially temporary costs that with the exception of 80/20 projects will come back in as demand recovers.\nJohn Inch: That makes sense. I mean, we do see the 140 in terms of sales that\u2019s kind of a high watermark, and then maybe next quarter it's a little bit lower. I mean -- I'm not trying to be that precise. I'm just trying to understand that -- hey, we're going to keep these costs in for the rest of the year. And as you have said now, they might start coming back sooner. So just wondering, where do you guys fall out?\nScott Santi: Well, I think given our margin profile, they're going to go -- they'll start to -- let's call it sort of sprinkle back in based on how the revenue recovers. So, I think as we've said throughout we are leaning into the investment side of the opportunity profile in the recovery, doesn't mean that we're going crazy, but ultimately, as Michael said the tactical cost savings in Q2 was in response to revenue levels that were down 29%. They will come all the way back in the third quarter, but they'll -- I think it -- I would assume a fairly linear sort of redeployment of some of those resources as things go forward based on in linear in line with revenue.\nJohn Inch: It makes sense. Thanks both very much.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nAndy Casey: Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nAndy Casey: Within construction, you talked about U.S. non-residential down in Q2; I would assume that probably impacted some other segments like Welding as well. What are you hearing from your customers about the second half? Is it is it getting worse or is there really no change visible?\nMichael Larsen: Are you talking specifically on the commercial construction side, which is a fairly small portion of our business in North America or construction overall?\nAndy Casey: Construction over all ex-resi [ph]\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I mean I think we don't expect a significant level of improvement on the commercial construction side here in the second half based on what we're seeing so far the strong demand is really like we said on the residential side through the home center channel, that's where we saw significant growth in Q2 and we do expect that seems to be holding up fairly well here in the near-term, but not on the commercial side.\nAndy Casey: Okay, thank you, Michael. And then on business wins from your ability to deliver the $100 million is pretty impressive. Did that come from things like auto or was it more prevalent in -- what might be shorter cycle business wins?\nMichael Larsen: Sum of each, but I'm trying to -- auto was maybe a 20% of it.\nAndy Casey: Well, that's pretty good. Okay, thanks very much.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnn Duignan: Hi, good morning, everyone. I appreciate the color on the half two outlook for automotive and food service so please directionally, could you give us some color on the other segments that you're contemplating in the backup for those businesses?\nScott Santi: Yes, so and these are with all the caveats, again, in terms of being bottom up projections and back to -- we don't have a lot of backlog these are -- our business model is much more kind of a read and react. But, with all that said, I think on the Welding side, we still expect a fairly challenging second half particularly on the industrial side and probably down in the second half somewhere around 15% year-over-year. The Test & Measurement, Specialty businesses should perform a little bit better than that based on kind of current demand trends with some strength in consumer packaging. We talked about semi healthcare clean room those two segments could be down somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10%. And then construction as well as was Polymers & Fluids, maybe down in the mid single-digits, somewhere around that. But, I just want to make the point again around the real advantage that ITW have in terms of this highly diversified high quality set of businesses and the fact that there's room in these numbers because we know that some will perform -- have worse revenues that what I just told you and some will have better and if you put all that together that's what gives us the confidence in the second half scenarios that we laid-out in the in the presentation. But hopefully this is helpful in terms of additional transparency.\nAnn Duignan: Absolutely, and I appreciate everything you said. That we're not locking down two decimal points here just directionally, it's helpful to understand what you're thinking or seeing. And then just a quick follow up, you mentioned that automotive OEMs are pursuing more strategies of supply within country of demand, but I thought automotive OEMs had already gone that route. And so maybe you could give us some examples of where -- are there opportunities for OEMs to source locally again that are not already doing. I think last quarter you might have mentioned OEMs considering moving back from Mexico potentially is that an opportunity or I'm just curious as to\u2026\u2026\nScott Santi: I think -- without trying to think about how much I want to offer here out of -- from the standpoint of our need to obviously keep things our interactions with our customers confidential. But let me say that Europe represents probably an area from the standpoint of localization of some significant potential shift.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nScott Santi: Not just U.S.\nMichael Larsen: Yes.\nAnn Duignan: Just U.S. And have you heard any comments from OEMs about relocating from Mexico to U.S. or is that just chapter in the supply chain?\nScott Santi: I have not personally. No.\nAnn Duignan: Okay, we get that question quite frequently. So I appreciate your color. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Thank you, everyone.\nScott Santi: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, two for me. First on the restructuring side. Certainly interesting, right $50 million, $45 million of it, you probably would have just eating on a pay-as-you go basis without even kind of pointing it out if we were in normal times. For the businesses given kind of hopefully or like a once in a lifetime pandemic shot on goal for restructuring came up with $50 million bucks.\nScott Santi: I -- that's a shockingly low number. But I guess it's kind of a testament what you've told us before about how these businesses are operating. There's just not a lot of stuff laying around to do.\nJeff Sprague: And any other perspective on that and, and how quickly these actions might pay back.\nScott Santi: Well I think -- I think the perspective on your comments is just that, A, we've been working on sort of margin and operating efficiency for seven years. So there's -- and we can always get better. That's the $45 million, right. We're -- every year we're trying to be a little bit better. The other half of it, though, in terms of the $50 million -- the limited amount of incremental, that's pandemic related is goes back to what we said in the commentary, which is we're staying structured to support demand two to three quarters out. And we don't have any -- that's an advantage that we have given the margin cushion, given the cash flow profile. We expect the economy to revert to growth at some point, I can't tell you exactly when, but I think nobody's betting against the global economy long-term and we're going to stay, we're certainly not. And so $50 million is a response to the strategy that we've agreed on with all of our divisions, it says we're going to stay invested. And we're going to stay focused on making sure we can serve our customers and lean into growth as these businesses recover. And I'm not predicting necessarily a fast recovery; I'm just saying it's going to recover eventually.\nMichael Larsen: And then the other thing I'd add, the other thing I'd add to that, Jeff, maybe more from a modeling perspective is that of the $50 million, we expect that to be more weighted towards Q3, maybe somewhere around two-thirds of it in the third quarter. And then I think the overall payback on these projects, what's really encouraging is it's, it's projected to be less than 12 months, which supports again continued improvement as Scott referenced in -- on the margin front in 2021. And I'll just point you saw the enterprise initiatives again, here, this quarter, 100 basis points and a significant chunk of that where are these 80/20 projects, which is the bulk of what we're talking about that are driving your continued margin improvement.\nJeff Sprague: And then secondly, maybe kind of a little bit more strategic Scott. But, very clear what you're saying about positioning to gain share to outperform in the recovery. But also just looking at your portfolio, right and sitting here kind of in the light of this pandemic and thinking about opportunities to kind of pivot in a different direction or a weakness exposed in a business that you haven't previously thought about, is there anything that really kind of comes to mind where you're thinking about kind of portfolio positioning that you might want to order as we look forward even if you don't want to [Indiscernible]\nScott Santi: Yes, this would be the perfect place to disclose that. So\u2026\u2026..\nMichael Larsen: I appreciate the question. I actually -- I sort of -- I think if anything is reinforcing our, the value of this diversified portfolio and let\u2019s just sort of focus on what happened at auto this quarter. I -- auto has been our fastest growing -- it\u2019s one of our fastest growing segments for the last five to seven years before we did the acquisition, we picked out sort of solid mid-20s margins. And I would honestly say that it's given the dynamics in the industry and the way we support that industry on a long-term basis, it's probably one of the segments that we think has the best long-term growth prospects. And the fact that we can absorb the kind of hit that we took in that business in the quarter and have that be offset by five of seven food equipments the other similar example. I think that's the kind of capability that allows us to stay invest where we want to stay invested the right the -- the sort of short-term ups and downs and not have to manage the portfolio based on some sort of\u2026.\nScott Santi: In view of the future that we are guessing that. We started and end with, is there a lot of value-add that we can create in an industry, the margins ultimately are the proof point on that. And ultimately, we don't want to be in shrinking industries. But GDP, GDP plus a little bit industries are great businesses for us. And when we've got those characteristics, and we can sink our teeth into those industries for 10 or 15 or 20 years that's a great position. So I don't -- nothing has been exposed in my mind from this in terms of any part of our in one of our seven businesses that has created any problems for us or things that we would make any changes in any way. I think we clearly [Technical difficulty] that we didn't run seven businesses pretty well. They don't work on the same cycles. They don't -- they're all affected by the pandemic in exactly the same way. And all of that together says to me, it's more about word let's go find the eighth one at some point. Not about, we got to get out of one of these.\nJeff Sprague: Yes, great. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: So, that's the big announcement of today.\nJeff Sprague: There are ways to what you ate [ph] there.\nMichael Larsen: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open.\nJoel Tiss: Hey.\nScott Santi: Hey, Joel.\nMichael Larsen: Hey, Joel.\nJoel Tiss: Just a follow up on that that last idea you threw out there are acquisitions that they are popping off? Are they getting a little more attractively priced or anything you're starting to come a little closer on feeling like it's time to do something?\nScott Santi: I will just comment and say that I think if you're a business that is not in distress during these times, this is not a time a good time to sell your business. So I think that the kinds of opportunities that may emerge are some quarters out and have less to do with sort of near-term financial distress and perhaps, relative to more strategic merits over the long haul. So, we're not spending a lot of time on, trying to try to build a pipeline right now at all because it's -- again, if you're a good quality business, this is probably not -- you're not going to sell with your numbers where they are today.\nMichael Larsen: Something came my way to [Indiscernible] that that we thought was a real fit, we would certainly be willing to take the real serious look at it. So it's not an issue of our-- ownership demand. It's more an issue probably of supply in the near-term. The kinds of things that we would want -- we would be interested in.\nJoel Tiss: Okay, and you given us a couple of a couple of pieces of some of the highlights on, acting to stay ahead of the curve and to benefit to win in the recovery. Can you kind of pull it all together? Staying there for your customers is one thing you've highlighted a couple times. Are there any other pieces that we should be thinking about?\nScott Santi: Well, we talked about certainly supply chain localization, we talked about staying invested in our innovation programs, our strategic sales excellence. I don't think there's a whole lot beyond those broad categories that -- and I think there's probably some pretty good potential for some significant substance in those broad categories. This is not an easy period to manage your supply your cash flow during this kind of stress on the down and then on the recovery side. And there's a lot of disruption right now and so our ability to stay the course we have to believe is A, the either right thing to do for our customers long-term makes us even stickier with them, in fact they are taking -- count on us through thick and thin. And certainly there ought to be some opportunities where perhaps people we compete with in various businesses unable to do that it\u2019s on our consistent that may spin-off some opportunities for us. That's about as complicated as it is.\nJoel Tiss: Okay, okay thanks. And definitely your strategy is showing it's excellent during these times. So, thank you very much.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nScott Santi: Nigel.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nNigel Coe: Yes, so the comment about taking advantage of the stress I think is really interesting. It's not something that we hear from some other companies that we cover. So I'm just curious if you are seeing some real signs of your distress and with the competitors, and perhaps, food equipments and your pockets in the auto channel might be the more obvious places, but I'm just wondering if you're seeing that now was there something you expecting to see maybe from inventory shortfalls or an inability to ramp up me anymore color would be really helpful.\nScott Santi: Yes, I would say, in the near-term, it's probably too early. Yes, right now volumes are still just starting to recover. We're not seeing that a lot of distress, a lot of the programs that I referenced in my commentary that are new are related to new opportunities. And that -- there's no I can try to think through the list. There's no competitor distress component to any of those. But there were people we competed with for those programs that we aren't able to commit to the same delivery, the delivery timetable we could that ultimately want us the business of that. So that I'm trying to make that distinction in the short run. But look, I would certainly say that there is from the standpoint of product availability, the impact of cash flow, working capital if this cycle starts to go to, if it gets in the growth mode. And there's going to be some cash flow constraints on people, their ability to fund working capital, if the rate we can certainly and keep up as things accelerate. I think that's more where those opportunities start to emerge.\nNigel Coe: Right now, that's another question rather. And then my follow up is, it seems but when I look at your kind of -- your framework for revenues and ROI [ph] for this year, it looks like you're still planning for the detrimental around about gross margin rates in the back half of the year, correct me if I am wrong Michael. But does that imply that when you get on the other side of this and you don't have a lot of these discretionary costs come back in other do you have that your incremental can be higher on recovery? Normally you have 35% plus and price savings. Does that look more like a 40% plus, plus EF going forward or mean any color that would be good as well?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think that's a fair comment Nigel, I think that when the recovery when demand really starts to pick up here on a year-over-year basis, you're going to see some higher than usual incremental margins from ITW. I think in terms of the second half question, if you just look at the framework we've provided. And again, we're not really focused on managing to a decremental margin number here in the near-term. I think is -- as we said, is much more around positioning for the long-term, but decrementals, kind of in the low 40s for the second half, a little bit higher than that in Q3 as a result of the restructuring and then in Q4 like we said on the last call, we expect to be back in kind of a more normal decremental margin in the 35% to 40% area. But really the most important part of your question is when we do expect higher incrementals when things begin to accelerate here in a meaningful way.\nNigel Coe: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nNathan Jones: I just wanted to ask a question on the food equipment side of the issue. You're seeing a lot of restaurants closing down permanently operating at lower capacity. What's your view on the likelihood that, there's going to be a fair amount of used equipment in the market, some customers here are going to be stressed. Maybe not looking to buy the high quality ITW equipment in the short-term here. And whether or not that could even have any impact the used equipment in the market on the institutional side of the business over the next few quarters here?\nScott Santi: Yes, I think if you look at the product lines that we compete with, at the top tier, the used equipment market is not really an issue for us. It's much more an impacted mid tier competitors and not to people like ITW. In terms of where restaurants might end up? I think that's an open question. I mean, I think clearly, we've seen a meaningful decline in the near-term here on the restaurants and the QSR side and we'll continue to stay close to it and we'll be there to support our customers every step of the way, including with the service side of things, which is a really important part of opening these restaurants back up again that really starts -- service call to make sure that all the equipment is operational and done what it's supposed to do for our customers. So that's really how I would think about that. Nathan.\nNathan Jones: That's helpful color. You just commented that you\u2019re not spending a lot of time building the M&A pipeline at the moment. You had suspended the their share repurchase program given, very strong cash flow, good outlook for free cash flow for the rest of the year. What are your thoughts about the timing of reinstating the share repurchase program?\nScott Santi: Yes, I think that's a -- it's a fair question, just given how strong the free cash flow performance is and how strong the liquidity and the financial position of the company is. At this point, it's still early stages in terms of the recovery and our position is we're going to wait until this recovery path is a little bit clearer until we reinstate cash share repurchases. So we've -- for now we remain kind of on hold until we see how things might play out a little more clearly going forward.\nNathan Jones: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRoss Gilardi: Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. I mean, most of mine have been answered. And I don't know that you will answer this one. It's just a follow up on M&A and just your preferences with the current portfolio on what you might want to add to and I'm just wondering, as the relative attractiveness of the various end markets, shifted it all in this new environment and I'm, thinking specifically about food. I think this is an area that most of us from the outside might have assumed that rank higher in the packing order in terms of areas so might like to add to in the future. I don't think I'm going out on a big win there. In reality in this type of downturn, it's turned out to be your most cyclical business, whereas the market like construction, which is supposed to be most cyclical was down in the lease in the third quarter -- in the second quarter, I think because of what's happening at the home centers and consumers investing in the home and so forth. So really just asking, how is the -- has a relative packing order changed at all or the you just still look at this kind of the exact same way they would have before?\nScott Santi: Well, I think your commentary sort of almost answered the question from my perspective, which is everything you said that nobody saw coming. And the next time we go through some contraction, I'm sure it will absolutely not be -- not work exactly this way. So I think in terms of relative attraction, what in every one of our businesses, every one of the seven, given the margin return on capital profile there that that if we had the right opportunities, we would certainly think about adding to all of them. And that's, again, we're taking a long-term view so that is dependant on where they are in terms their near-term relative distress. So, we wouldn't be afraid to add scale anywhere, but it's going to have to be -- we don't need to talk about scale in terms of the size of our position we don't -- we get no benefit from scale in terms of cost, given the way we run 80/20. So, we would only act if we had an opportunity to add to one of our positions -- really differentiated products access to a new market, a new end market, a new geography, etcetera. So there has to be some long-term benefit, but I don't think we chide away from any. I wouldn't necessarily rate any sort of higher priority lower priority across the seven.\nRoss Gilardi: Okay, got it. Just one quick housekeeping one just for I think for Michael. Yes Michael, on your scenario analysis applied the $60 million of restructuring spend in the$ 45 million from 80/20. Is that baked into your various margin scenarios or your margin scenarios excluding those costs?\nMichael Larsen: It is included. So we're -- as you become accustomed to. We don't adjust numbers here. So this is really these are the GAAP numbers that we're showing on the page and everything is included here including the restructuring.\nRoss Gilardi:\nwhat:\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Karen Fletcher for closing remarks.\nKaren Fletcher: Thanks. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and stay well.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Let's turned to Slide 5. As Scott mentioned, priority number 3 for managing through the pandemic is to maintain ITW's considerable financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality. In the second quarter we did just that. And going forward, we will continue to live on that priority. As we leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position ITW for maximum participation in the recovery. On our last earnings call, we shared our expectation for an unprecedented level of demand contraction to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. And indeed, organic revenues declined an unprecedented 27%. As expected, automotive OEM and food equipment were the hardest hit segments. Other segments fared much better, providing another proof point for the benefit of ITW's diversified high quality business portfolio. At the enterprise level, total revenues declined 29% as organic revenues declined 27% in foreign currency, and last year's divestitures further reduced revenues by about a point each. Nevertheless, our businesses still generated $449 million of operating income and delivered resilient operating margin performance of 17.5% with operating expenses down more than $140 million and enterprise initiatives contributing 100 basis point. As expected, free cash flow was strong at $681 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year and 213% of net income. Q2 cash flow performance did benefit from the delayed timing of U.S. income tax payments of $158 million, which were paid in the third quarter. Our divisions stepped up to their credit monitoring and collection efforts early in the quarter. And as a result, our receivable performance has continued to remain in line with historical norms. The balance sheet, and our liquidity remained strong throughout the containment phase as we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash on hand, essentially no short-term debt, no commercial paper, a $2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, Tier 1 credit ratings and total liquidity of more than $4.3 billion. As expected, ITW had more than enough financial strength and resilience to withstand the shock to the system that the global economy experienced in Q2. We were prepared for it, we managed our way through it effectively. And today we're strongly positioned for the recovery. With that, please turn to Slide 6, for a retrospective look at second quarter revenue, starting with organic revenue by geography. As you can see, the demand contraction with global as North America declined 26%, Europe was down 37%, and Asia Pacific was down 7%. On a positive note, China was up 1% after being down 24% in Q1, as the early phase of their recovery began to take hold. On the right side of the slide, we're sharing average revenue per working day by month. As we move through the quarter, and we compared it to last year, you can see that April was the bottom and then we experienced a sequential acceleration in May. And in June, as the global economy began to reopen. This trend has continued in July. Now, let's go to Slide 7 for segment performance. And on the left side, you can see the most and least affected segments in terms of organic revenue and operating margin. For comparative purposes, I should point out that these margin numbers are fully-loaded on operating margins, not segment margins. It is also notable that five of seven segments delivered operating margins above 20%, despite organic revenue declines ranging from 9% to 25%, and the two segments overcame the significant negative volume leverage to actually expand operating margin year\u2013over-year. Turning to the right side of Slide 7. As expected, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe essentially shutdown in mid-March and only began to restart production in May, June. Our automotive OEM business was the hardest hit. Overall organic revenues were down 53% year-over-year, although we did see a significant uptick in June that is continuing in July. North America was down 62%, Europe down 59% and China was the bright spot with organic revenue up 6%. Importantly, as order production continues to ramp up in Q3, our local close to the customer manufacturing positions remain fully resourced and in position to continue to serve our customers every step of the way, and with the same world class quality and delivery that they have come to expect from us. Turning to Slide 8, also as expected the second hardest segment was food equipment, as organic revenue declined 38%. North America organic revenue was down 33% and international declined 44%. Equipment sales were down 38% and service was down 37%. Institutional sales including healthcare facilities and hospitals were slightly more resilient down about 30%. And not surprisingly, restaurants QSR were down about 45%. Relatively speaking, sales to grocery retail customers held up better, down only 14% with some equipment orders being pushed out due to COVID concerns and retail service sales were flat with prior year. Test & Measurement and Electronics, Organic revenue declined 11% with Test & Measurement down 12% and Electronics down 9%. While demand for CapEx Equipment dropped sales were up double-digits in end markets tied to semiconductor healthcare and clean room technology. And despite negative volume leverage, operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.7% with excellent cost management and enterprise initiatives as the main contributors. Turning to Slide 9. In Welding demand slowed significantly, as organic revenue declined by 25% with Equipment sales down 28% and Consumables down 21%. Industrial end markets declined 40% while commercial end markets were fairly resilient, down only 11%. That said despite a 29% of [higher] Revenues Q2 operating margin was 21.6%. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue was down 14%. Polymers was down 20% in line with industrial and MRO trends. Auto aftermarket was down 14% with retail sales improving in a meaningful way as stores open back up as the quarter progressed. Fluids had the best performance with organic revenue down only 5% held by product sales into health and hygiene end markets. Operating margin was up 30 basis points to 23.1% driven by enterprise initiatives and strong tactical cost management. Moving to Slide 10, Construction, organic revenue was down 9% with North America which is almost half of the segment, up 1% with double-digit growth in the residential renovation market served through the home center channel. This strength was partially offset by a 21% decline in the North America commercial business and internationally as Europe was down 28%, reflecting a more restrictive quarantine protocol. Australia and New Zealand sales were down only 3%. Specialty organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 15% and the international side down 19%. Demand for consumables in our consumer packaging businesses such as Zip-Pak were up double-digits offset by orders for packaging equipment being pushed out and some lower sales into the appliance and aviation industry. So let's move to Slide 11 for an update on some full year 2020 performance scenarios. On our last call, we provided three financial scenarios to illustrate the fact that we have the financial strength and margin profile to withstand whatever comes our way over the near-term and therefore, our number 1 priority is positioning to play offense in the recovery. With Q2 in the books, we're updating these scenarios for a key operating metrics, organic revenue, operating margin and operating income. The caveats that will be discussed during our Q1 cost to apply i.e. this is the time of extraordinary and unprecedented uncertainty, and accepting any significant recurrence of major economic shutdowns. As you can see, we are narrowing the range of likely four year outcomes based on our second quarter performance and current demand trends across the company. And what stands out is that in all three scenarios, ITW's operating performance is strong in terms of operating income and operating margin. And while we're not providing formal guidance as we sit here today, we are tracking closest to the mid scenario. The second half organic revenue is down about 12%, which would translate into a full year organic decline of approximately 14.5% and operating margins of 20% to 22%. And in an unprecedented year like this, should this scenario hold, we would still make somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion of operating income and generate more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow. As demand recovers, we want to be in a strong position to fully support our customers as their businesses begin to re-accelerate. As a result, we expect an increase in working capital and therefore lower free cash flow of about $600 million in the second half of the year. Importantly, though, we're going to make sure that we're in a strong position to both respond to our customers needs, and take share from competitors who can throughout the recovery. As we discussed on the last call, we're going to make some fairly modest capacity and cost structure adjustments based on projects submitted by our division leaders who have now had a chance to better assess the pace and slope of recovery in each of their respective businesses. We currently projected that we will spend about $60 million in restructuring projects in the second half of the year, including $45 billion [indiscernible] to back projects that were already planned for 2020 that we placed on a temporary hold as the early stages of the pandemic unfolded. As a reference, we spent about $80 million on restructuring in 2019. And about $30 million of that was in the second half of the year. It is worth noting that the average payback for these projects is projected to be less than 12 months. Finally, just some a brief comments on capital allocation to let you know that our position has not changed from our last call. First with regard to the dividend we've recognize the importance of our dividend to our long-term shareholders. We continue to view it as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model, and we remain strongly committed to the dividend. In terms of strategic optionality we are clearly in a position of strength with ample liquidity and balance sheet capacity and strong credit ratings. We remain open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of a pandemic and we're in a strong position to react to high quality strategic opportunities that are aligned with our enterprise strategy. Lastly, we suspended share repurchases until end market stabilized, and the recovery path becomes clearer. So let's move on to Slide 12. And I'll turn it back over to Scott to share some more thoughts on our recovery phase strategy. Scott, back to you. Same to you Andy. Thanks, Well, I think the short answer is no. I mean, I think, as you know, we're not an auto company, we're really benefiting in Q2 in the second half from this high quality, highly diversified portfolio. So we don't have to get the forecast 100% right in automotive, because we know we're going to have offsets, one positive or negative and other parts of the company where as you know, we're very much a read and react company. We don't have a lot of backlog. We don't have great visibility. Beyond, two to three weeks in auto for example, but we do have the ability to respond very quickly to changes in demand. We, expect a challenging second half in automotive certainly better than Q3. And then just did we transparent with -- what auto might look like in the second quarter based -- in the second half based on feedback from customers current demand trends, we're looking at being down about 15% in the second half of the year for automotive. Of course, a lot of that depends on how quickly production ramps up what auto sales do in the second half of the year, but maybe that gives you a sense for how that might play out. And maybe just to -- you asked around what the second half might look like profitability we fully expect based on what we're seeing now that the business will be profitable in the second half and we will be returning to double-digit margins as we go through the year. This beginning recovery here in automotive. I think in terms of market share rather than talking about specific customers, I think I'd go back to the themes that Scott talked about the fact that we have a high degree of confidence that they are real market share opportunities and their discussions with customers that are taking place every day and every single one of our divisions and we pointed to over $100 million of new business generated here in the second quarter just as a result of that the first element, which is our ability to continue to supply and deliver for existing and for new customers. So I think we -- that's, that's maybe how we think about the market share opportunities. Good morning. So, the first part, July is up sequentially from June to answer your question. I think in terms of the channel, we've talked about this before, John. We really given how short cycle we are and how our businesses are set up, really we're talking about very little backlog, we get the order today, we ship tomorrow we replenish the inventory the day after, we don't have great visibility to what the channel has in terms of inventory. They don't need to carry it out of inventory, because they know that if they place the order with us, we're shipping it tomorrow. So, it's not really a big driver in terms of how our sales might be reacting here. No, we really don't need to and that's construction, every segment every division is run the same way here so, so the answer is no. Thank you. Are you talking specifically on the commercial construction side, which is a fairly small portion of our business in North America or construction overall? Yes, I mean I think we don't expect a significant level of improvement on the commercial construction side here in the second half based on what we're seeing so far the strong demand is really like we said on the residential side through the home center channel, that's where we saw significant growth in Q2 and we do expect that seems to be holding up fairly well here in the near-term, but not on the commercial side. Sum of each, but I'm trying to -- auto was maybe a 20% of it. Yes. And then the other thing I'd add, the other thing I'd add to that, Jeff, maybe more from a modeling perspective is that of the $50 million, we expect that to be more weighted towards Q3, maybe somewhere around two-thirds of it in the third quarter. And then I think the overall payback on these projects, what's really encouraging is it's, it's projected to be less than 12 months, which supports again continued improvement as Scott referenced in -- on the margin front in 2021. And I'll just point you saw the enterprise initiatives again, here, this quarter, 100 basis points and a significant chunk of that where are these 80/20 projects, which is the bulk of what we're talking about that are driving your continued margin improvement. I appreciate the question. I actually -- I sort of -- I think if anything is reinforcing our, the value of this diversified portfolio and let's just sort of focus on what happened at auto this quarter. I -- auto has been our fastest growing -- it's one of our fastest growing segments for the last five to seven years before we did the acquisition, we picked out sort of solid mid-20s margins. And I would honestly say that it's given the dynamics in the industry and the way we support that industry on a long-term basis, it's probably one of the segments that we think has the best long-term growth prospects. And the fact that we can absorb the kind of hit that we took in that business in the quarter and have that be offset by five of seven food equipments the other similar example. I think that's the kind of capability that allows us to stay invest where we want to stay invested the right the -- the sort of short-term ups and downs and not have to manage the portfolio based on some sort of.... So, that's the big announcement of today. Okay. Hey, Joel. Something came my way to [Indiscernible] that that we thought was a real fit, we would certainly be willing to take the real serious look at it. So it's not an issue of our-- ownership demand. It's more an issue probably of supply in the near-term. The kinds of things that we would want -- we would be interested in. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, I think that's a fair comment Nigel, I think that when the recovery when demand really starts to pick up here on a year-over-year basis, you're going to see some higher than usual incremental margins from ITW. I think in terms of the second half question, if you just look at the framework we've provided. And again, we're not really focused on managing to a decremental margin number here in the near-term. I think is -- as we said, is much more around positioning for the long-term, but decrementals, kind of in the low 40s for the second half, a little bit higher than that in Q3 as a result of the restructuring and then in Q4 like we said on the last call, we expect to be back in kind of a more normal decremental margin in the 35% to 40% area. But really the most important part of your question is when we do expect higher incrementals when things begin to accelerate here in a meaningful way. Good morning. It is included. So we're -- as you become accustomed to. We don't adjust numbers here. So this is really these are the GAAP numbers that we're showing on the page and everything is included here including the restructuring."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Well, things are far from normal for any of us or our businesses at present. I'm extremely proud of how the ITW team is managing through the unprecedented and challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic. I want to begin by sincerely thanking my ITW colleagues around the world for the effort, dedication and selflessness that they continue to demonstrate daily and protecting the health and safety of their colleagues while continuing to serve our customers with excellence. As I have said many times, the power of the ITW business model and our decentralized entrepreneurial culture are never more valuable than during times of significant and rapid change. And we are leveraging both to position the company to participate across a wide range of recovery scenarios while continuing to execute our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITw's full potential performance. Over the last seven years, we have made significant progress and executing our strategy to take full advantage of our unique strengths to clearly established ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality and most respected industrial companies. And in doing so building a company that has both the enduring competitive advantages and the resiliency necessary to deliver consistent upper tier performance in any economic environment. Well, needless to say the resilience component of that equation is now being tested in ways that were hard for many of us to even imagine six to seven months ago. And as evidenced by our second quarter results, this company in our team of over 45,000 dedicated professionals are rising to the challenge. In the second quarter, in the face of an unprecedented 29% decline in revenues, ITW delivered $449 million in operating income, $681 million in free cash flow, and operating margins of 17.5%. We leveraged our flexible cost structure to reduce operating expenses by more than $140 million without any centralized cause takeout mandate from corporate, while providing full compensation and benefit support to every ITW team member, sustaining investments and key long-term growth strategies, and positioning for full participation in the recovery. As we outlined during our first quarter earnings call, we have an integrated four prong strategy for managing the company through the pandemic. Protect and support our people continue to serve our customers with excellence, maintain our financial strength and strategic optionality and win the recovery. These four priorities comprised the central near-term planning and execution focus for the whole of ITW, and for every one of our operating divisions. We'll come back to them at the end of our presentation. But first let me turn the call over to Michael who will provide you with additional detail on our Q2 performance. Michael over to you. All right. Thank you, Michael. So moving forward, while significant end market disruption and uncertainties remain, we will continue to leverage our financial strength and the performance power of our business model to prioritize playing offense in the recovery over playing defense in the contraction, and to ensure that every one of our businesses is strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery. Job one is to protect our people while continuing to serve our customers with the world class quality and delivery performance that they expect from us. Thus far, our people have done a superb job on both fronts and across the company. We will remain intensely focused on these two mission critical imperatives. Second, we're going to lean in hard to the upside by remaining invested in staff to support anticipated demand two to three quarters out, so that we have ample cushion to both fully support our customers as their businesses re-accelerate and to capture incremental share gain opportunities that we expect might emerge along the way. In that regard core to the recovery planning process in every one of our 84 divisions is the identification and actioning of specific pandemic related share game programs and opportunities that are aligned with our long-term enterprise strategy. Finally, we will leverage our advantaged financial position to sustain the investments we've made to support the execution of our enterprise strategy. We are taking the long view and from that perspective when the recovery is an execution component of our long-term enterprise strategy. It is not a separate strategy. It is about every one of our divisions identifying specific opportunities to aggressively accelerate progress in executing key aspects of their enterprise strategy agenda, due to the effects of the pandemic. Things such as newer changing customer needs, competitors, distress, ability to stay invested, et cetera. In fact, we're already seeing areas of opportunity emerging in our businesses. And these are some of the early themes. First, ITW's undisrupted ability to supply and deliver during these times of tremendous volatility and disruption is a significant asset. In the last quarter, we landed new programs worth a combined $105 million annually with a handful of key customers based largely on our ability to provide immediate supply. Second, many companies including many of our existing customers are moving away from low cost country sourcing strategies and looking to localize their supply chains in response to risk and challenges exposed first by trade and tariff related disruptions, and now by the effects of the pandemic. Our long standing commitment to local produce where we sell manufacturing has uniquely positioned ITW to support existing and new customers in making this transition. Just recently, one of our businesses was awarded nearly $10 million in new business a result of one of their key customers moving to build more local supply capability. In addition, a number of our automotive OEM customers are implementing strategies to localize their supply chains and we are in a very strong position to support them in this regard. And third, we are already benefiting from remaining committed to our strategic sales excellence and customer back innovation investments. Our ability to stay the course means that the people that we have invested in, in these critical areas remain in place and that they are not distracted by downsizings, reorganizations, top down mandates or shifting priorities. They remain focused on serving customers, seizing new opportunities, and continuing to innovate. It's just one illustration, in the second quarter our new patent filings were up 24% over the last year. So in closing, on behalf of Michael and our entire executive leadership team, we offer our deepest thanks to our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication always, but especially during this period of unprecedented circumstances and challenges. Well, there is obviously a lot that we will have to work our way through in the months ahead. I have no doubt that the strength and resilience of ITW's business model, our diversified high quality business portfolio and our people position us extremely well to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenge that lie ahead. With that, I'll turn it back to you Karen. Good morning. Hi, so let's start with your question on Europe, specifically, which represented 25% of our sales in the quarter and saw as you pointed out there most significant decline year-over-year at 37%. By far, the most significant decline was in the automotive business as you might expect down 59% followed by food equipment down 48% and then construction down 28%. In terms of the kind of the framework that we're providing for the second half year and your question around how the dynamics might play out by region, we're anticipating, again, in a very dynamic environment here, North America and Europe down both in that 10% to 15% range, year-over-year and then Asia Pacific and China as you pointed out better than that flat maybe slightly positive as we look at the second half year. A lot of \u2013 probably the thinking on how the second half plays out ties back to your first, the second question, which was around July and the trends, so. The trends that we saw, sequentially in the second quarter were certainly encouraging April, the bottom acceleration in May, June. And those trends have continued into July. I wouldn't read too much into one month year. I think this remains a really like I said, uncertain environment. And the best way to think about this is really this second half framework that we've provided as you look at how this might play out, but certainly encouraging kind of near-term demand trends that continued into Q2. Due to [indiscernible] I would add on the cost side as we were very intentional and that decimating the business and this was the hardest shutdown across our portfolio. And we clearly knew that was going to take place production stops from mid-March through mid-May. And ultimately we made a choice not to do anything that would impair that we also expected that once that those hard shutdowns were over that things would recover. Maybe not certainly not back to their prior demand levels but a long way from zero, which is where they were for those 60 days or so. So I think there was a lot of intention in -- if your reference point is to the fact we lost money in that business that was, we certainly could have mitigated some of that if we wanted to worry about that. But ultimately, our decision and our biggest concern was making sure that we were there to support our customers on the other side of that. You too. Yes. Good morning, Jamie. Yes, so specific on food, we'll probably be the hardest hit segment here in the second half of the year. We're looking at potentially being down somewhere around 25%. But even with that sort of kind of unprecedented decline, we expect that business to continue to be profitable. And we expect margins to continue to improve from where they were in Q2 and being back into double-digit territory here in Q3 and Q4. Yes. I think and I think the only thing I would add, Jamie, is it just in terms of impact on the balance of the year? We're not really that -- focused on that. We're looking for long-term opportunities that are sustainable ultimately the programs that I referenced will that have some incremental benefit in the back half, sure. But ultimately, we're not looking so I guess the point I'm trying to make is we're not looking for quick hits that are opportunistic. We're looking for opportunities to move faster on opportunities that we would want even in normal times, and expected certainly based on the second quarter, but certainly optimistic that those will continue to pop up as we move forward. Good morning. Yes, I think it's -- I think I may have mentioned this, it's the continued execution on the enterprise initiatives contributing in a meaningful way to the all front-to-back projects really it carryover from last year since we put a halt on restructuring especially in the first half of the year. And then just really good, tactical, management of our operating expenses $140 million at the total company level and every -- in every segment, including in Test & Measurements, so. And then I think the other thing -- I wanted their top line was maybe a little more resilient than some of the other segments. We talked about the strength in semi healthcare clean room technology, and they certainly benefited in Test & Measurement. We are essentially 100% open and all of our divisions are serving customer needs at this point, so. Around the world, yes. All right, thank you. Yes, John, everything other than the structural costs that we have already planned to take out this year, which are the kind of the front-to-back savings, those are structural savings, but everything else is essentially temporary. And so this was our response to current levels of demand as the recovery continues to take hold you in the second half of the year, the majority of these costs will come back in again. Certainly, we'll continue to remain our divisions, disciplined and focused in terms of cost management, but these are essentially temporary costs that with the exception of 80/20 projects will come back in as demand recovers. Well, I think given our margin profile, they're going to go -- they'll start to -- let's call it sort of sprinkle back in based on how the revenue recovers. So, I think as we've said throughout we are leaning into the investment side of the opportunity profile in the recovery, doesn't mean that we're going crazy, but ultimately, as Michael said the tactical cost savings in Q2 was in response to revenue levels that were down 29%. They will come all the way back in the third quarter, but they'll -- I think it -- I would assume a fairly linear sort of redeployment of some of those resources as things go forward based on in linear in line with revenue. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you. Yes, so and these are with all the caveats, again, in terms of being bottom up projections and back to -- we don't have a lot of backlog these are -- our business model is much more kind of a read and react. But, with all that said, I think on the Welding side, we still expect a fairly challenging second half particularly on the industrial side and probably down in the second half somewhere around 15% year-over-year. The Test & Measurement, Specialty businesses should perform a little bit better than that based on kind of current demand trends with some strength in consumer packaging. We talked about semi healthcare clean room those two segments could be down somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10%. And then construction as well as was Polymers & Fluids, maybe down in the mid single-digits, somewhere around that. But, I just want to make the point again around the real advantage that ITW have in terms of this highly diversified high quality set of businesses and the fact that there's room in these numbers because we know that some will perform -- have worse revenues that what I just told you and some will have better and if you put all that together that's what gives us the confidence in the second half scenarios that we laid-out in the in the presentation. But hopefully this is helpful in terms of additional transparency. I think -- without trying to think about how much I want to offer here out of -- from the standpoint of our need to obviously keep things our interactions with our customers confidential. But let me say that Europe represents probably an area from the standpoint of localization of some significant potential shift. Not just U.S. I have not personally. No. Hey, Jeff. I -- that's a shockingly low number. But I guess it's kind of a testament what you've told us before about how these businesses are operating. There's just not a lot of stuff laying around to do. Well I think -- I think the perspective on your comments is just that, A, we've been working on sort of margin and operating efficiency for seven years. So there's -- and we can always get better. That's the $45 million, right. We're -- every year we're trying to be a little bit better. The other half of it, though, in terms of the $50 million -- the limited amount of incremental, that's pandemic related is goes back to what we said in the commentary, which is we're staying structured to support demand two to three quarters out. And we don't have any -- that's an advantage that we have given the margin cushion, given the cash flow profile. We expect the economy to revert to growth at some point, I can't tell you exactly when, but I think nobody's betting against the global economy long-term and we're going to stay, we're certainly not. And so $50 million is a response to the strategy that we've agreed on with all of our divisions, it says we're going to stay invested. And we're going to stay focused on making sure we can serve our customers and lean into growth as these businesses recover. And I'm not predicting necessarily a fast recovery; I'm just saying it's going to recover eventually. Yes, this would be the perfect place to disclose that. So........ In view of the future that we are guessing that. We started and end with, is there a lot of value-add that we can create in an industry, the margins ultimately are the proof point on that. And ultimately, we don't want to be in shrinking industries. But GDP, GDP plus a little bit industries are great businesses for us. And when we've got those characteristics, and we can sink our teeth into those industries for 10 or 15 or 20 years that's a great position. So I don't -- nothing has been exposed in my mind from this in terms of any part of our in one of our seven businesses that has created any problems for us or things that we would make any changes in any way. I think we clearly [Technical difficulty] that we didn't run seven businesses pretty well. They don't work on the same cycles. They don't -- they're all affected by the pandemic in exactly the same way. And all of that together says to me, it's more about word let's go find the eighth one at some point. Not about, we got to get out of one of these. Hey, Joel. I will just comment and say that I think if you're a business that is not in distress during these times, this is not a time a good time to sell your business. So I think that the kinds of opportunities that may emerge are some quarters out and have less to do with sort of near-term financial distress and perhaps, relative to more strategic merits over the long haul. So, we're not spending a lot of time on, trying to try to build a pipeline right now at all because it's -- again, if you're a good quality business, this is probably not -- you're not going to sell with your numbers where they are today. Well, we talked about certainly supply chain localization, we talked about staying invested in our innovation programs, our strategic sales excellence. I don't think there's a whole lot beyond those broad categories that -- and I think there's probably some pretty good potential for some significant substance in those broad categories. This is not an easy period to manage your supply your cash flow during this kind of stress on the down and then on the recovery side. And there's a lot of disruption right now and so our ability to stay the course we have to believe is A, the either right thing to do for our customers long-term makes us even stickier with them, in fact they are taking -- count on us through thick and thin. And certainly there ought to be some opportunities where perhaps people we compete with in various businesses unable to do that it's on our consistent that may spin-off some opportunities for us. That's about as complicated as it is. Thank you. Nigel. Yes, I would say, in the near-term, it's probably too early. Yes, right now volumes are still just starting to recover. We're not seeing that a lot of distress, a lot of the programs that I referenced in my commentary that are new are related to new opportunities. And that -- there's no I can try to think through the list. There's no competitor distress component to any of those. But there were people we competed with for those programs that we aren't able to commit to the same delivery, the delivery timetable we could that ultimately want us the business of that. So that I'm trying to make that distinction in the short run. But look, I would certainly say that there is from the standpoint of product availability, the impact of cash flow, working capital if this cycle starts to go to, if it gets in the growth mode. And there's going to be some cash flow constraints on people, their ability to fund working capital, if the rate we can certainly and keep up as things accelerate. I think that's more where those opportunities start to emerge. Good morning. Yes, I think if you look at the product lines that we compete with, at the top tier, the used equipment market is not really an issue for us. It's much more an impacted mid tier competitors and not to people like ITW. In terms of where restaurants might end up? I think that's an open question. I mean, I think clearly, we've seen a meaningful decline in the near-term here on the restaurants and the QSR side and we'll continue to stay close to it and we'll be there to support our customers every step of the way, including with the service side of things, which is a really important part of opening these restaurants back up again that really starts -- service call to make sure that all the equipment is operational and done what it's supposed to do for our customers. So that's really how I would think about that. Nathan. Yes, I think that's a -- it's a fair question, just given how strong the free cash flow performance is and how strong the liquidity and the financial position of the company is. At this point, it's still early stages in terms of the recovery and our position is we're going to wait until this recovery path is a little bit clearer until we reinstate cash share repurchases. So we've -- for now we remain kind of on hold until we see how things might play out a little more clearly going forward. Well, I think your commentary sort of almost answered the question from my perspective, which is everything you said that nobody saw coming. And the next time we go through some contraction, I'm sure it will absolutely not be -- not work exactly this way. So I think in terms of relative attraction, what in every one of our businesses, every one of the seven, given the margin return on capital profile there that that if we had the right opportunities, we would certainly think about adding to all of them. And that's, again, we're taking a long-term view so that is dependant on where they are in terms their near-term relative distress. So, we wouldn't be afraid to add scale anywhere, but it's going to have to be -- we don't need to talk about scale in terms of the size of our position we don't -- we get no benefit from scale in terms of cost, given the way we run 80/20. So, we would only act if we had an opportunity to add to one of our positions -- really differentiated products access to a new market, a new end market, a new geography, etcetera. So there has to be some long-term benefit, but I don't think we chide away from any. I wouldn't necessarily rate any sort of higher priority lower priority across the seven. Thank you."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For those participating in the Q&A, you'll have an opportunity to ask one question and if needed one follow-up question. Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. \nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Julianne. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW\u2019s First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. I'm joined by our; Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; Vice Chairman, Chris O\u2019Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s first quarter 2020 financial results as well as the impact of the global pandemic on our business and our strategy for managing through it. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2019 Form 10-K, the Form 8-K filed today, and the Form 10-Q to be filed on May 7, for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to slide 3. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Stating the obvious, a lot has changed relative to the environment we operated in for most of the first quarter. As a result, our focus this morning will be on the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and, more specifically, our strategy to leverage ITW\u2019s considerable strengths in executing on the challenges and opportunities ahead. I will provide some brief commentary on our Q1 performance, and then we will transition to our pandemic strategy. We have included much of our normal quarterly performance detail in the appendix and you are of course, welcomed to ask questions regarding our Q1 results during the Q&A session at the conclusion of our presentation. As Karen noted, I've asked our Vice Chairman, Chris O\u2019Herlihy to join Michael and me on the call this morning, as I thought that it would be helpful for you to hear perspectives from all three of us and how we are managing through the near-term challenges of the containment period we're currently in and on the actions we are taking now and will take over the coming weeks and months to ensure that the company is positioned to participate fully in the recovery.  Before we jump in, I want to offer our heartfelt thanks to all of our ITW colleagues around the world. We talk often about the fact that our decentralized entrepreneurial culture is a key element of ITW\u2019s secret sauce. It is core to who we are as a company, and it is never more valuable than during times of significant and in this case, rapid change. The proactive teamwork, ingenuity and selflessness of our people and quickly adapting to rapidly changing conditions and tackling new challenges that seemingly arise daily at the moment is ITW at its finest. We thank all of our colleagues for the incredible level of care and commitment they are bringing to keeping their co-workers safe, while continuing to serve our customers with excellence. The fact that the ITW team has responded exactly as we expected they would doesn't make it any less extraordinary. Now on to first quarter results, total revenue declined 9% year on year with organic revenue down 6.6%, currency at 1.5% headwind, a negative 1% impact from divestitures and 40 basis points of PLS.  The majority of the organic revenue decline occurred in the last two weeks of March where we saw organic revenue down more than 20%. By geography, North America was down 5% and Europe was down 7%, China was down 24% for the quarter, but appears to have bottomed in February and was flat year on year in April. An encouraging sign. In the face of a challenging demand environment, we continue to execute well on the elements within our control. Despite a 9% decline in revenues, operating margin was flat at 23.6%, 5 of our 7 segments expanded margins in the quarter due largely to benefits from enterprise initiatives which contributed 120 basis points to operating margin at the enterprise level. After tax return on invested capital is 27% and free cash flow was $554 million with a conversion rate of 98% of net income. Lastly, as noted in our press release this morning, given the uncertainties regarding the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are suspending our previously announced guidance for full year 2020. We will resume guidance once and market stabilized and the recovery path becomes more clear.  Now let's shift gears and talk about how we will manage ITW through the global pandemic. Please turn to slide 4. Despite the unusual and in some cases unprecedented challenges of the moment, we continue to execute at a high level and with our usual degree of focus and discipline across the company. As a result of all the work we have done over the last 7 years in executing our enterprise strategy and the progress we have made on the path to our full potential performance, ITW is today in a position of significant strength in dealing with the effects of the global pandemic.  Today's ITW is centered on our powerful and proprietary business model and our people are better trained and more skilled at executing it than ever before in the history of our company. ITW is 80/20 front to back methodology and the laser light focus that drives on the relative handful of critical performance, difference makers, and every one of our businesses has served the company extremely well in times of both opportunity and challenge for a long time now. I have no doubt that this unique ITW skill will be a significant asset to us as we work our way through the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are very fortunate to have a decentralized operating structure and an entrepreneurial culture that has been developed, nurtured, and protected over many years. Our people think and act like owners. They are accountable and they deliver. They are deeply trained in our business model, our strategy and our values and I assure you that even in an unprecedented times such as these, none of them are waiting around to be told what to do. In addition, in today's ITW, we have worked hard in shaping our portfolio and driving consistent high quality execution across every business in it, both to position the company to deliver consistent upper tier long term earnings growth, when global conditions are favorable and to build in a margin cushion and level of diversification, that makes us highly resilient during most periods when they are not. And it follows from there that the robust free cash flow we generate through our strong margin profile, and the unique attributes of our business model, combined with our very, disciplined capital allocation strategy, gives us an extremely strong balance sheet and Tier 1 credit ratings. So with these elements is our foundation, our strategy for managing through the pandemic and its aftermath is to focus, on the following four priorities. First, to protect the health and support the well being of our ITW colleagues, second, to continue to serve our customers with excellence, third, to maintain financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality and fourth, to leverage ITW strengths to position the company to fully participate, in the recovery. Chris will give you some additional color on priorities one and two. Michael will cover priority three and I will come back and cover priority four. And then, we'll open it up for your questions, Chris. Good morning, over to you.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. This is a challenging time for all of us, as the world continues to grapple with the effects of a global pandemic. At this point, I'm sure that every one of us has been impacted by this situation, in ways that were unimaginable just a few months ago. And ITW as a company and the community is certainly being affected. Having said that, and Scott reference, or divisional leaders think and act like owners, are able to react quickly and take the necessary actions to protect our people and serve our customers, which is a particular advantage of the company, in times of significant challenge. Let's move to slide 6. The actions were taken to protect the health and support, the well being of our colleagues. We developed and deployed a number of practices to minimize exposure. And prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep our colleagues safe. We have followed CDC, WHO, and local government guidelines in doing so. Out ITW colleagues have redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices, adjusted shift schedules and assignments that have colleagues who have childcare needs, due to school closings and implemented aggressive new water and sanitation practices, to minimize infection risk. We're also providing full compensation to employees, who have been quarantined. In addition, our strategic sourcing team is heavily engaged in helping our businesses, by coordinating the procurement of personal protective equipment, to ensure all our employees receive the protection they need. I'm pleased to say, that as a result of our containment efforts, to this point we've largely been able to restrict infections to single cases, in a minority of our locations, which is a testament to the actions our colleagues have taken to implement sound sanitation practices and social distancing and to protect one another, to the best of their abilities. Turning to slide 7, let's shipped to another important stakeholder group and how we continue to serve our customers with excellence. To support our customers, our teams have worked diligently to keep our factories open and operating safely. In areas around the world where governments have issued shelter in place orders, the vast majority of ITW businesses have been designated as critical or essential businesses. And as such, they're needed to really an open and operational. In some cases, it's because our products directly impact, the COVID-19 response effort. For example, our welding equipment is used to manufacture hospital beds or structural products are utilized to build temporary medical facilities, or test and measurement products test medical and laboratory equipment. Our Polymers & Fluids products sanitize workplaces. And our food service equipment is used to feed people in hospitals. In other cases, our businesses are designated as critical, because they play a vital role in serving and supporting industries. They're essential to the physical and economic health of our communities. Although, some facilities are subject to mandatory shutdowns, roughly 95% of our global manufacturing capacity is currently available to be deployed to serve our customers. The same is true for our service networks, particularly in food equipment and test and measurement, which we continue to keep fully available in order to ensure that we can help keep essential businesses and healthcare facilities in operation. In both cases, across all segments, we continue to maintain best-in-class performance for product and service quality and the availability. Finally, we're rigorously managing our supplier base to both mitigate near-term supply risk for critical raw materials and components and ensure that we are positioned to win in a wide range recovery scenarios going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Larsen: Okay, thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Well, that\u2019s the primary objective of our enterprise strategy, an important byproduct, if you will, a lot of work done over the last seven years is that ITW is in a position of considerable financial strength to deal with highly disruptive events, such as this global pandemic. In many ways, ITW was built for times like this. And through the pandemic, we will manage the company to maintain our financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality so that we can leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position the company for maximum participation in the recovery. Turn to Slide 9, there's no question that in Q2, we will see an unprecedented level of demand contraction due to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. ITW has more than enough financial strength and resilient \u2013 resilience to withstand this kind of shock to the system, that the global economy is under experience over the next several months. We are prepared for it. We'll get through it. And we'll come out the other side strongly positioned for the recovery. As we sit here today, one month into the quarter, we're estimating the Q2 revenues will be down 30% to 40% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around how May and June actually play out but that is our current view. As you would expect, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe have been essentially shut down since mid-March, and are only beginning to restart production in early to mid-May. Our automotive OEM business will be the hardest hit with revenues potentially down 60% to 70% year-over-year. And abrupt decline of this magnitude in the quarter is pretty unprecedented. As difficult as it may look, if it plays out this way, we expect that ITW will still make operating profit in the $200 million to $400 million range, generate free cash flow of more than $500 million and end the Q2 with cash on hand of about $1.5 billion. Onto slide 10. Knowing that we have the financial strength to withstand whatever comes our way over the next few months, our number one priority becomes positioning to play offense in the recovery. And this is an area where our strong margin profile really helps us. Whether the pace of recovery is fast or slow, V shaped or U shaped, over the next few quarters, it doesn't really impact us that much. Under very fast paced recovery, we end up down 15% for the full year, and margins are 19% to 21%. They're much slower recovery, revenues are down 25%. Yet, our margins are still a very strong 17% to 19%. This is against a backdrop, where most of the companies that our divisions compete with came into the pandemic, with margins at half of ours or less. As a result, a number of them may have to retrench in a major way in order to get through the epidemic, potentially creating some significant share gain opportunities for us in the recovery. With our margin cushion, we are concerned with how quickly demand is going to recover in Q3 or Q4. We can be fairly certain that it will be incrementally better than Q2. But beyond that, it really doesn't affect us a whole lot, which allows us to think long-term and positioned for maximum participation in the recovery, making sure that we are in a strong position to fully support our customers, as their businesses begin to re accelerate, and that we are in an equally strong position to take share from competitors, who can't, is the central imperative of our pandemic response planning for every one of our divisions. We will, of course, need to manage our businesses smartly across our portfolio and make some meaningful capacity and cost structure adjustments in businesses, where we expect prolonged recovery periods, or maybe even permanent demand impacts from the pandemic. But as we always do, we will leave those decisions in the hands of our divisional leaders as they are in the best position to assess the pace and slope of the cut of the recovery in each of their respective businesses. Turning to slide 11. The financial benefits of our enterprise strategy, combined with the work done to optimize our capital efficiency, capital structure and capital allocation over the years, has put ITW in a very strong position going into this crisis. At quarter end, we have more than $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. At the end of Q1 and it's still the case. As of today, we have essentially no short-term debt. And we have not issued any commercial paper. Why you might ask? Simply put, because we don't need to cash. We have a $2.5 billion undrawn credit facility available to us, if needed in the future bring our total liquidity to about $4 billion as we sit here today. Our net leverage is only 1.7 times and our next maturity is pretty small, $350 million and not until September 2021. High quality of earnings and strong free cash flow are hallmarks of ITW. As you know, we consistently generate significantly more cash than we need for internal purposes. And our annual conversion rate from net income is consistently above 100%. We expect that to continue to be the case, as we manage our way through the pandemic. As evidenced by Tier 1 credit ratings that are the highest in our peer group, we continue to have excellent access to credit markets in the event that we needed. During this time of market volatility, it's also worth mentioning that our pension plans, have remained in great shape. Over the years, we have consistently funded and de risked our plans. And as we sit here today, our largest U.S. plan is funded at 104%. Turning to slide 12. So how do we think about and adjust our capital allocation approach during the pandemic? First, with regard to the dividend. We recognize the importance of ITW's dividend to our long term shareholders. We have a long history, with more than 56 years of growing the dividend. And we are part of a small group of so-called dividend aristocrats, and one of about 18 companies that has increased its dividend for more than 50 years. And we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Since 2012, we have increased the annualized dividend from $1.52 per share to currently $4.28 per share, a cumulative annual growth rate of 16%. Simply put, we remain strongly committed to our dividend and as we sit here today, we do not see a scenario where we would have to reduce the dividend. In terms of strategic optionality, we are clearly in a position of strength, with ample balance sheet capacity. And we're certainly open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of the pandemic. It could be in the form of more reasonable valuation opportunities for assets that we were already interested in, as well as some unique opportunities with quality companies that may not have the financial strength to weather the pandemic. Given our financial strength and ample capacity, we will be in a strong position to react to any high quality strategic opportunities that may emerge. We will continue to fully fund all internal investment and CapEx projects that meet our criteria, like we always have, but the number will likely come down in terms of aggregate spend in the near term, simply due to the fact that we don't need any capacity expansion projects for the next several quarters. Finally, I think, it comes as no surprise to anyone that we have suspended share repurchases until end markets stabilize and the recovery path becomes clearer. With that, I'll turn it back over to Scott.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Michael. And as a priority four, which is all about leveraging our strengths to make sure that every one of our businesses are strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery. In short, we are going to be there to serve every bit of our customers' needs as their businesses begin to reaccelerate and be well prepared to capture any share gain opportunities that may come our way.  Food equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2% year-over-year despite a tough comp of 5% organic growth last year. The service business was solid up 4% in the quarter. Equipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year-over-year comps for both of those. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor. Test and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6% with 13% growth in our Instron business. The segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers. Electronics was up 2%. Margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record, 28.1% the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Also in the quarter, we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million. In the face of an unprecedented demand contraction in Q2, as Michael commented earlier, we will still generate operating income in the hundreds of million dollars and generate over $500 million in free cash flow. We will manage discretionary expenses prudently, but we don't need to start cutting muscle immediately. And we certainly want to avoid doing so, before we have some level of indication as to the shape and slope of the recovery in each of our businesses. With this principle in mind, to this point, we are providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues around the world. And we're going to do our best to sustain that level of support for all of our people through at least the end of Q2. We are doing it because we are in a position to support our people at a time of great personal and family stress and uncertainty. And we think that it's the right thing to do. But we're also doing it to protect the significant investment we have made in training and developing great ITW people and great ITW leaders over the past seven years. As Michael mentioned, it is likely that we will need to make some staffing adjustments to align with prolonged or permanently lower demand in some of our businesses as a result of the pandemic. So we are committed to being there for all of our people during the worst of this, and we will take the time to make whatever longer-term adjustments need to be made thoughtfully. The second principle is that we're going to lean into the upside by remaining invested in structure to capture incremental demand. Given the profitability of our core businesses in the strength of our financial position, what's the bigger risk for ITW, carrying more cost and it turns out we need for a few months or cutting too much and not being able to fully serve the needs of our customers and take share from our competitors as the recovery accelerates. Obviously, we believe short sheet and the upside potential of the recovery would be the far bigger mistake for ITW. And we're going to plan and execute our recovery strategies accordingly. The third principle is that we're going to leverage the strength of ITW to protect investment in areas of strategic importance to the execution of our long-term strategy. We're early in our planning around all these areas. But as one example, prior to the pandemic, we invested two plus years in our strategic sales excellence initiative that included significant investments in new sales and sales leadership talent. We have the financial capacity to protect these types of long-term strategic investments. And doing so is worth a lot more over the long-term to the company, there are a few extra detrimental margin points in the short-term. That being said, decremental margins should likely be in our normal 35% to 40% range in Q4. Between now and then, we're going to focus on making sure ITW is in a strong position to fully participate in the recovery. Turning to slide 14, this is just a reminder that our long-term strategic priorities remain unchanged that we are committed to achieving and sustaining ITW potential performance, and continuing on our quest to firmly establish ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality, and most respected industrial companies. Now let's move on to slide 15 to wrap things up. Once again on behalf of Chris, Michael and I, and our entire executive leadership team, we thank our ITW colleagues around the world for the exceptional job they are doing under the most challenging circumstances. As of right now, there's no way to know how severe this crisis will be, how long it will last, or how quickly our customers and then markets will recover. What I do know is that the strength and resilience of ITW\u2019s business model and our people put us in about a stronger position as an industrial manufacturing company can be in, to deal with that whatever will unfold over the coming weeks and months. I have every confidence that ITW will rise to the challenges we always have over the course of our 108-year history. Our strong financial position and margin profile give us the ability to make strategic moves now to position the company to fully participate across a range of recovery scenarios, and to come out the other side ready to continue on our path to ITW full potential performance. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Scott. As a reminder, please see the appendix in today's slide deck for the usual segment detail for the first quarter. So Julianne, let\u2019s open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnn Duignan: Hi, good morning, everybody. Appreciate being on the call. Scott, maybe you could talk a little bit about your various businesses and whether you would anticipate that any of the businesses might be permanently impaired rather than just cyclical and I'm thinking welding, oil and gas, I'm thinking through the equipment, you know, et cetera, et cetera. How are you thinking about that as we look forward?\nScott Santi: I'd say and overall, it's just way too early to tell. I think, I don't see anything you know, we have a division that provides support equipment to the airline industry is probably among the ones that I would say would see kind of the longest tail in terms of recovery. But from where we sit today, as early as it is in this whole process, it's I don't \u2013 I don't see anything that that would be sort of obvious or apparent in terms of permanent change or damage, if you will, from this pandemic. There may be but we'll deal with it.\nMichael Larsen: I might just add Ann, if you specific to oil and gas, if you look at the enterprise level, our sales into oil and gas are in the no single-digits and maybe as you were pointing out, primarily in welding, maybe 15% to 20% of welding depending on what year you're in, primarily on the international side. But as Scott said, it's really too early to tell what the recovery path might look like in that part of the company.\nAnn Duignan: Perfect, thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on the strategic M&A and the opportunities to update at maximum participation when the recovery occurs, could you just expand on that a little bit? Like, it is interesting to hear you comment on that?\nScott Santi: Well, I think there is no, this is no, nothing I would characterize as a change in strategy, we had certainly talked for some time about the addition of some incremental growth from acquisitions as a core part of our strategy. I think there's, you know, it's not rocket science to anticipate that there are going to be either from the standpoint of a reset on valuation and/or given the level of financial stress its going to be out there that there might be some opportunities emerge as a result in our own commentary is that we are going to preserve our ability to access those that doesn't change the criteria one but this is not a matter of looking at things that we would have not looked at otherwise, but the sort of relative availability of things that would fit \u2013 I would expect would be perhaps more enhanced as a result of the situation.\nAnn Duignan: So we shouldn't anticipate you stepping up and making a larger than expected acquisition in a new platform or anything like that. Is that what you're saying? That there's no change in the strategy, just the opportunities might be more?\nScott Santi: Yeah, well, I'm not sure I would limit it based on size. I think it's a function of stick with that strategy. Obviously, we've talked about that criteria in the past and we\u2019ve got an opportunity that kind of business that has high value add content in terms of their products and the way their products impact their customers, and where we see a significant ability to impact the performance of a business through the application of our business model. That's what I'm saying is the same as it's always been. Whether that's big or small, will be a function of the quality of the asset less than the size.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. I appreciate. I'll get back into thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Hey, Scott, Michael.\nScott Santi : Good morning\nJohn Inch: Good morning. And Chris, given that there's no centralized cost containment actions that you guys are announcing today, I'm wondering, if the detrimental as you've presented include assumptions that the businesses preserve respective cost containment actions or are they more of a kind of a worst case scenario?\nScott Santi : I'm trying to interpret the question. I think, John, I think if I'm going to paraphrase here, I think you're asking, what is included from a restructuring standpoint for the balance of the year?\nJohn Inch: Sure. Recognizing -- recognizing that you're not doing it centrally? It's coming from the businesses.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah. Absolutely, I mean, I think the honest answer is until we know what the recovery path looks like, and the divisions have had a chance to really interpret, you know, division-by-division, what that path is, and therefore, what capacity and cost, adjustments need to be made. We don't know what the restructuring is going to be. But obviously, we have included in the numbers that we're showing you today, a placeholder for an educated guess I hope for what restructuring might be. But it really is. John, as you might appreciate, too early to tell at this point.\nScott Santi: Yeah. And I think the sort of core planning mandate around this and everything we've just tried to articulate is we're going to spend the next couple of quarters really making sure that we're in the right position to fully support our customers and access any incremental growth opportunities that might emerge from this recovery phase. And we'll \u2013 we'll do what we always do. We'll adjust our cost structure smartly. We're not going to do it through some, either from on high we're going to do it business-by-business. That's no different than we've always done it. The difference now is that, we are have positioned from the standpoint of entry margins and the final cushion that we have is we can take the time to plan our way through it in a way that doesn't necessarily does our best to protect The upside potential next really all we're saying, I said in my comments that, we'll be back to our normal incremental by Q4. But there's really no benefit to us that I see of trying to as I said, when the \u2013 when the containment phase and you know, how fast we can cut costs is not is not something that we have to worry about, we have the luxury of building this position doesn't mean, we're not going to be smart. It doesn't mean, we're not going to have to adjust our cost structure over time, but we're going to do it from a position of much greater clarity business by businesses to how this is likely going to play out. That clarity doesn't exist today. It's very hard to see until we get much further down through Q2 and into Q3.\nJohn Inch: Based on the way you're set, yeah, well \u2013 I was going to say Scott based on the way you're standing up for your people, I bet you you're going to get an awful lot of people knocking, very qualified people knocking on your doors wanting to work for ITW is this whole thing progresses.\nScott Santi: We\u2019re just trying to be the same. Thank you.\nJohn Inch: Well, no but it's other companies are not following this tax. So I think it's worth calling out. My question is, hold on. I don't have COVID, just \u2013 coming out of this, because there's been no broader centralized temporary cost actions, that you have to kind of get layer back because other companies are taught in leading model 2021. Please don't assume very high incremental because we have to layer in all these costs that have to come back that are temporary. Could you possibly infer that, I know you talked about the detrimental is going back to 30%, 35% in the fourth quarter because there's no big centralized temporary actions, could be incremental in 2021 be closer to 40% coming out of this, if not even a little bit higher?\nScott Santi: I see no reason why they wouldn't be our normal 35 plus.\nJohn Inch: Perfect. That answers it. Thank you.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Thanks John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citibank. Your line is open. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning guys. Hope you're well.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Thank you, Andrew. Same to you.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: As you know, one of the main topics that you're going to talk about at your Investor Day that was canceled by the pandemic was to give us more color on ITWs overall portfolio, in terms of its ability to outgrow in the markets. So when you look at the 30% to 40% drop in Q2, we know a lot of it is auto related, but even excluding auto, it appears you're thinking about 20% and 30% decline for the rest of the businesses. So are any of these businesses still expected to underperform their markets or is it really that ITW has simply levered to some end markets right now such as auto or food equipment when the markets are just challenged by the pandemic? \nScott Santi: Well, I, I'd say a couple of things, specifically around Q2. One is, certainly in auto and -- what's going on in restaurants right now, food equipment and the whole sort of CapEx environment, why would most companies are certainly pulling back big time in any sort of CapEx until they have more clarity as to what the future will hold. What I would say also is in Q2 that's certainly a significant multiplier is all the supply chain, the brakes go on, there's a multiplying effect of both. Beyond just the consumption of whatever the products are. It's related to the reduction, radical reduction in inventories to supportive, significant double-digit drop. So I'm not sure there's a lot of comparisons to the market and that valid and Q2 for that reason. Let's get through it. Let the smoke clear a little bit and see how things are starting to normalize in Q3 before we make any assessments in terms of relative growth. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And Scott maybe if I can follow up on that, you usually guide to run rates, so is that kind of what\u2019s -- and then maybe\u2026\nScott Santi: We used to give Q2 run rate we don\u2019t quit.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So maybe you can talk about sort of what you're seeing in April and then, pecking order, you mentioned, we talked about food equipment, we know auto is going to be the worst, so any sort of more color on which markets may outperform or which markets may be weaker with them -- the understanding that auto and food equipment\u2026\nScott Santi: Yeah. Let me ask Michael address for April and sort of the relative Q2 performance across the segment.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah I think, Andy, as we pointed out the hardest hit segment as you might expect is the one that we're calling out specifically with automotive down 60% to 70%. And I think as you called out, that is a 10 point drag on our overall enterprise top line. So if you were to say ex-auto, we -- balance of the businesses is down in that 20% to 30% range. Food equipment certainly one of the more challenged businesses here in the short term, particularly in the restaurant side, without going into too much detail, but we're seeing a lot more resilience in food within on the institutional side, whether it'd be health care or education as well as on the retail side, as you might imagine. So, but overall food equipment will certainly be more challenge than the average, probably down in that 35% to 45% range here in the in the near term, and recovery will depend on all the things that you're aware of in terms of when these restaurants are able to open back up again, when we\u2019re able to co service the equipment and so forth. Welding certainly challenged on the CapEx side. We talked a lot about the oil and gas exposure their. Welding would be down probably in line with the average of the company and then from there, there's some pretty good resilience in places like testing measurements, specialties and will probably be down in that 10% to 20% range. So, I think this is as difficult of Q2 as certainly, we've seen and it happened that as you know, very quickly. And I'll just point back to the overall profitability of the company. I mean, even with these numbers I just went through, we are going to be very profitable. We're going to generate more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We'll have at the enterprise level, double digit operating margins. There'll be higher than some of our peers going into before this whole, pre COVID situation. So it's a real position of strength, even with this macro shock that we're dealing with, we'll get through the near term and, we'll be much stronger when we come out the other end. So, that's kind of my segment a little bit of detail for you. April is tracking. I think we had a forecast going into -- we developed early. April, we thought we'd be down 30% to 40%. And April is tracking. April will \u2013 April and May, will be difficult months. There are some indications that things are starting to improve. I think Scott mentioned by region, China, for example, we had a bottom probably in the month of February down in the mid 30s. And April was flat so, in the automotive business might be flat in Q2 here in China. So, there's certainly some early signs that things have bottomed here in April and May, like I said difficult and then we'll see June. But obviously, all of this with the usual caveats. This is a highly uncertain situation. But, I'd say, as we sit here today, I'm pretty confident that we're seeing the worst of it right now. And we'll get through this. And we'll see what the second half of the year is going to look like in terms of recovery.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color guys.\nScott Santi: Sure, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning and hope everyone is healthy. Glad everyone is healthy and well. I just want to ask the question on the market share opportunity. I thought that's very interesting, sort of coming out of the down turn here. So, when you think about your markets, your strategy will be more focused on certain businesses that you view is more attractive within your portfolio broad based and then historically, how has -- where you see the biggest opportunities in downturns historically? What was the type of market share that it ITW usually gets in just sort of how sticky is that market share? Thank you.\nScott Santi: Well, I think this is certainly -- I'm not sure. Certainly, from my own perspective, how much past history is really relevant and valid. We're a very different company today than we were under -- in any prior contraction. And I would say, the other element is, this is a harder, faster, more challenging decline than any of us -- anybody's ever been through. So from the standpoint of the kinds of potential impacts it may have on a number of companies and what that might do ultimately to -- think about sort of the hard crash in a relatively robust kind of recovery, there's going to be a lot of -- you're going to have to be able to respond quickly all the way through the supply chain, not just your own capacity. So there's going to be a lot of challenges around. All of that, depending on different industries and how they ultimately recover in the pace. So I can't certainly predict or say that we have any view that one part of our company is going to be more ripe for those kinds of opportunities than others at this particular stage. What I am saying is, we're going to be prepared in every one of our businesses to be there, to be able to seize those opportunities if and when they emerge. And I think that's all I can say. We are -- I think we've done a lot of work on the portfolio, to say there's any part of our portfolio that we don't want to grow incrementally at this point, and it is not the way I would characterize it. I would also say that we're not going to -- we're not interested in superficial gains here. We're interested in share gains in areas where we're already focused. That\u2019s it. The way we're trying to serve and grow our positions in these markets for the long haul. So, we're not going to be looking for a quick sale and bailing out a competitor in an area that's not of interest to us long term. And that's a lot of what we're going through in the planning right now, is to not only make sure we have the capacity to support those incremental opportunities, but to make sure that our divisions have real clarity in terms of exactly where they're looking to grab those opportunities and where they're not.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate your insights.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, all and just wanted to echo the earlier comment on kind of that refreshing approach on preserving the employee base and kind of being farsighted on this. It's certainly not very common, as what we've heard so far.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I guess, Scott, just to follow up on Jamie's question there, when you think about what that means in terms of being able to attract more market shares as we exit. And it probably varies business by business, but is it competitors who have gutted the Salesforce, is it product development? What exactly does that -- maybe, it's probably not capacity. But what does that mean to you in terms of the means by which to do that? Yes. I like I said, I can imagine that. It's probably not a raw capacity issue. So where do you think ITW have the biggest advantage based on what you're doing today?\nScott Santi: Well, yes, I think it's harder to sort of characterize in one description a range of scenarios, but I do think the productive capacity is actually a big part of it, that as these markets turn, to the extent you haven't kept cushion in your supply chain, cushion in your capacity. Again, you can have the machines sitting around, but if you don't have the people there, you don't have the suppliers there ready to go, think about a scenario where we're in the second quarter, businesses in an industry is going to be down 30%. If it's down only 15% in Q3, that's a sequential improvement at a clip like nobody ever attest to manage before. And so I think those are -- I wouldn't discount your ability to deliver and supply as a core part of where these opportunities might emerge.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just specifically on Food Equipment. Obviously, a business that three or six months ago, and people would love to have had a contingency plan the way they are today. What percentage of the weakness would you just attribute to kind of customers being closed, i.e. when the lights come on, maybe there is a new normal, but that's not particularly robust, but kind of a step function improvement. I understand it's a fragmented market, so maybe hard to give visibility, but just any additional color you might be able to provide.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yes. So if we think about food equipment and specifically with the restaurant side of the business, 25%, 30% of our business, and the recovery there is going to not just depend on lifting of shelter and place restrictions, but also in terms of core shelter and place, what additional restrictions will be on the business in terms of occupancy and so on. Clearly, a very, very uncertain environment. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. But for us, we are somewhat comfortable by the fact that the other parts of our business, as Michael mentioned, the institutional piece, particularly health care, higher education is doing quite well. Retail is doing quite well, as you would expect. The typical deli counter business is thriving right now. We are being slightly a little bit in terms of being able to put in installations because they are so busy, but the long-term demand trends there are pretty healthy.\nScott Santi: And then service?\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: And in service is the other business where we continue to, to Scott's point, keep our service organization fully employed here. I mean we've taken a huge investment over the years in ensuring that we had a highly developed, highly trained service force. And the last thing we want to do is let those folks go, acknowledging that even though capacity is down right now, that will recover in the medium term.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Thanks Scott. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nScott Santi: Good morning. \nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Two from me. First, before we look any further forward, let's -- just looking back one more time on Q1, right? I mean, the margin improvement across the board on down revenues, it actually is pretty impressive. Just wondering how to put some context around this. We see kind of a big slug from the kind of the margin enhancement initiatives across the portfolio. Perhaps it's some of the PLS really shining through. I know every division is different, but perhaps we can focus on polymers or the electronics business where the margin performance was surprisingly strong.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. Thanks for the kind words, Jeff. I mean I think this was a good example in Q1 of what Scott was talking about that nobody is sitting around in our divisions that are waiting for somebody to tell them what to do. They react quickly -- the team reacts quickly when they see changes in demand. And so I think with revenues down 9%, the fact that margins were flat up in five or seven segments, the big driver continues to be, for us, after seven-plus years, the enterprise initiatives at 120 basis points. And price cost, no longer an issue for us. And then, of course, the volume leverage, we were able to offset some pretty meaningful headwind there to hold margins flat. So we expect the enterprise initiatives to continue as we go through the year. With lower volume, the overall contribution might be a little less than what you've seen in Q1 and last year in the 100-plus range, but it will still be a meaningful lever within our own control as we go through the worst of it here in Q2 and then head into the recovery in Q3 and Q4. I don't know if you want to talk about anything specifically. But by segment, the biggest driver is -- remains enterprise initiatives in that 70 to 160 basis points range by segment. And like I said, we expect that to continue to be a meaningful contribution as we go forward.\nJeff Sprague: Yeah. So maybe just to look at forward then, I mean, fully understand when revenues go down 30% or 40%, it does some pretty disruptive things to the decremental margins, and there's not a corporate-wide initiative. But it looks like you're implying 45% decrementals here in Q2. Wouldn't each one of these organizations, divisions individually, even though they're not cutting heads, right, they may be doing some pretty dramatic things on T&E and other discretionaries levers that they can pull. I know it maybe doesn't roll up cleanly to the parent that you can view with real clarity. But maybe just frame that, just kind of\u2026\nScott Santi: I can frame it. The big difference between Q1 and Q2 is the magnitude of the revenue decline, right? So we handled 9% decline in Q1, 7% organic. And certainly, those business level tactical adjustments, as Michael said, showed up very strong. The difference in Q2 is the magnitude of revenue decline is significantly greater. Those tactical adjustments are still there and ongoing. That's what when we talk about managing the business prudently, all of that is still in place. But we're also saying to our businesses, let's not react to this Q2 -- unprecedented Q2 that's not going to be reality beyond Q2. And we've -- as we've talked about a number of different levels here, we're going to preserve our ability to structure ourselves appropriately going forward and not react or overreact to the short-term conditions in Q2. Could the decrementals be better in Q2 if we wanted to drive something at that? Sure. But do we think that's the right thing to do for our company? Absolutely not.\nJeff Sprague: So the corporate role here in Q2 is actually to give the divisions license not to do anything damaging to their business?\nScott Santi: 100%? 100%. \nJeff Sprague: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nAndy Casey: Hi, good morning, and nice to hear all your voices.\nScott Santi: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Casey: Question on the supply chain. Are you hearing about any suppliers that may run into liquidity issues?\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah. So Andy, so with respect to the supply chain, no major issues to date for us with suppliers or some of the -- obviously, an issue we're managing very closely. We would feel certainly that our produce where we sell approach has served us pretty well here. We would also say that the fact that already centralized helps us to provide -- helps us as it provides 80 different kind of touch points, which enables us to kind of stay well informed and react quickly. So something we're rigorously managing, as we talked about in the presentation and not seeing any issues right now, but something we're very attuned to.\nScott Santi: And I think that, we've always been a source-local company. So from the standpoint of the diversity of our supply base that we are not dependent on one source relationships of finance globally, that we've got some level of risk mitigation and ability to shift and or go down.\nMichael Larsen: Right.\nAndy Casey: And then you made mention of, Scott, I think, it was your rapid inventory reduction. I'm presuming that's broadly speaking in the distribution channel. If we look outside of auto, how deep a reduction in inventory are you actually seeing in the channel? And does that suggest -- who knows, when it happens, but does that suggest you may see a fairly big restock if end market volume starts to sequentially improve?\nScott Santi: I would say that, we have almost no visibility in near-term, in terms of how inventories have been adjusted. I think it's a safe assumption to say that, anybody in the distribution business is certainly managing that aspect of their business very carefully. And ultimately, again, there are -- there's a sort of magnitude of decline and potentially magnitude of correction the other way that there are going to be factors here in terms of how companies are positioned to ultimately handle it. But I don't think we have any ability to say whether inventories are too high or too low still in the channel across most of our businesses at this point.\nAndy Casey: Okay. And then, if I could squeeze one more in. You kind of touched on it earlier. But, end-markets, specifically in Europe and North America, some other companies have talked about stabilization. I know it's granular, but in the last two weeks of April, outside of auto and food equipment, have you seen anything similar to that? Or is it just kind of still really, really weak?\nScott Santi: It's still challenged. And I mean, I think the closest you can get to talking about something stabilized are the data points that we provided on China were like I said, you know, in February, our sales were down I think 36% was the number and in April were flat. So that's probably the best I can give you. I think as we look at the regional numbers here, for Q2, total company is down 30 to 40, North America will probably be at the lower end of that in terms of down in that 25% to 35% range. And Europe will be higher than that and then China, like we said, flat for the quarter, maybe a little bit better, but, not to get into a sort of pick and choose situation. But, I would say, often things are not as bad in some cases, as any of us expected. It's not terrible. It's a unique situation. But we've got parts of our portfolio that are certainly stabilizing. And I'm thinking of some elements of business that are certainly there. They're all under some challenge, but if I want to -- I don't know to look at that we're still serving customers. And yeah, we're still in business. So we'll get through it.\nAndy Casey: Okay, thank you very much. And good luck. \nScott Santi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Your line is open.\nJoel Tiss: Hey, how's it going, guys?\nScott Santi: Good morning. \nJoel Tiss: I just wanted to, you know, most of them -- most of my questions have been answered, but I wonder if you're seeing any, sort of, pressure points or, you know, give us a little more granularity on some of the opportunities that for new rounds of enterprise initiatives or, you know, to further automate your factories and you know, that sort of thing like how does -- how do you evolve from what you're seeing and -- execute turning some of this pandemic into strength?\nScott Santi: I don't know if that changes a whole lot. We are highly automated in certain parts of the company because that's the right thing for the business in terms of not just the cost productivity, but also the level of quality that we need to build in the product. We have, -- as we've talked about forever, we have never been constrained from the standpoint of capital investments. So I don't know that I have any view that says because of the pandemic, we're going to have a shift in strategy under -- within the framework of 80/20, front to back in our business model. I think certainly, that business model helps us a great deal as we work our way through. A lot of the issues and challenges that will come about, but it doesn't \u2013 I\u2019m trying to think about your question, I can't think of anything fine.\nJoel Tiss: I understand. As there were changes, I mean, those will be conceived at the divisional level, depending on local circumstances that that made sense for them given the operating environment that they're in.\nScott Santi: Yeah. And I was going to say the -- all the projects and activities that add up to the enterprise initiative savings, those projects are still there. So, you know, nothing's really changed from that standpoint.\nJoel Tiss: And there's nothing like product line level that that you see some stresses that maybe you didn't see before that maybe there are businesses that don't fit anymore or need a little more restructuring than what we thought before? Or everything its kind of just unusual times and it's not a good -- not a good reason to make a different decision.\nScott Santi: I think we're got to let the smoke clear a little bit here to answer your question. I don't know, I certainly -- will there be some businesses that there's some fundamental change in the overall demand profile based on the impact of the pandemic. I'm sure across 85 divisions; we\u2019ll have some of that. We\u2019ll have some others that will have -- as we've talked about a lot, some incremental growth opportunities that will have to support with some investments. So we'll get to all that stuff. It's really hard sitting here in \u2013\nMichael Larsen: Historically.\nScott Santi: \u2026in the early May, given all this going on there. We need to have any clarity view or that.\nJoel Tiss: Okay, well, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Good morning. \nScott Santi: Good morning. \nDavid Raso: I\u2019m trying to think through the margin recovery potential for 2021. I'm trying to understand the 2020 cadence a little bit better. It sounds that you feel the second quarter will be the worst of it. And the decremental margins implied are 45. But if I look at your scenarios for the year, if I use the middle scenario, it implies the decrementals get worse in the second half. They're actually 49. And if you're saying the fourth quarter, we'll be back to 35, it's really implying a well over 50% decremental on the third. So I guess the question is why would it get worse on the decrementals because the comp isn't that different? And maybe the answer is, and Michael, you alluded to it, what's the placeholder for the restructuring? And is that mostly in 3Q? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: You just answered your own question. So that's exactly right. \nDavid Raso: I was trying to have it quantified.\nMichael Larsen: I know it's a nice try. \nDavid Raso: So is the third quarter restructure, I mean, it's... \nMichael Larsen: It\u2019s a nice try. I mean, like I said earlier, we just don't know yet. I mean -- and this is not -- with this company is a bottoms-up company and the restructuring will be what our VP, GMs and division leadership teams decide that they need to do once they have a clearer view of what the demand picture is. At that point, we have plenty of capacity and funding for all the investments we want to make, and -- including some of the restructuring that maybe required as we go forward. So, -- but that's really the best I can give you right now.\nDavid Raso: All right, so no quantification, but it feels more 3Q heavy based by that math on the cadence of the decremental. Is that at least fair?\nMichael Larsen: That\u2019s fair. I think the math\u2026\nDavid Raso: Thank you so much.\nScott Santi: Yeah, thank you.\nDavid Raso: I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nMichael Larsen: Bye David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRoss Gilardi: Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019m glad to hear from you guys as well. Hope everybody is well. I would just love to hear ITWs view on onshoring more of your production to the U.S., more of your supply chain. What are your -- your western customers are doing a lot of international business, saying on that, particularly in China? And just your overall perspective, is there enough onshoring that could happen in the overall industrial economy in the next year or two that could make a difference in the actual pace of economic recovery in the States as you see it? Just any views on that would be really interesting.\nScott Santi: Yeah, I can only speak for ITW in that regard, largely, which is that we have always been a produce where we sell company and we've talked about that often. And so from the standpoint of how any of this impacts our footprint from the standpoint of where we produce and where we source none of this changes any of that. I certainly think that there is likely to be, directionally, more movement for all the reasons you talked about amongst global manufacturers around localizing their production. I think there's certainly are going to be some lessons learned from the standpoint of the need to balance both lowest cost, the low-cost, lowest cost country sourcing, lowest cost with resilience, and redundancy. And so I absolutely think that will play itself out. From our standpoint, I don't know that, that presents any more or less opportunities. We're serving our customers globally. We'll certainly, perhaps, affect some of our supply points into those customers from a geography standpoint, but none of it that's going to have -- that I would say would result in any significant shift for us one way or the other.\nRoss Gilardi: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Unfortunately, we are out of time for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Karen Fletcher for closing remarks.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Julianne. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We're available to the rest of the day for additional follow-up. Stay well everyone, Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Okay, thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Well, that's the primary objective of our enterprise strategy, an important byproduct, if you will, a lot of work done over the last seven years is that ITW is in a position of considerable financial strength to deal with highly disruptive events, such as this global pandemic. In many ways, ITW was built for times like this. And through the pandemic, we will manage the company to maintain our financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality so that we can leverage our strong financial foundation and resilient profitability profile to position the company for maximum participation in the recovery. Turn to Slide 9, there's no question that in Q2, we will see an unprecedented level of demand contraction due to the complete shutdown of wide swaths of the global economy. ITW has more than enough financial strength and resilient \u2013 resilience to withstand this kind of shock to the system, that the global economy is under experience over the next several months. We are prepared for it. We'll get through it. And we'll come out the other side strongly positioned for the recovery. As we sit here today, one month into the quarter, we're estimating the Q2 revenues will be down 30% to 40% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, there's a fair amount of uncertainty around how May and June actually play out but that is our current view. As you would expect, given that most of our automotive OEM customers in North America and Western Europe have been essentially shut down since mid-March, and are only beginning to restart production in early to mid-May. Our automotive OEM business will be the hardest hit with revenues potentially down 60% to 70% year-over-year. And abrupt decline of this magnitude in the quarter is pretty unprecedented. As difficult as it may look, if it plays out this way, we expect that ITW will still make operating profit in the $200 million to $400 million range, generate free cash flow of more than $500 million and end the Q2 with cash on hand of about $1.5 billion. Onto slide 10. Knowing that we have the financial strength to withstand whatever comes our way over the next few months, our number one priority becomes positioning to play offense in the recovery. And this is an area where our strong margin profile really helps us. Whether the pace of recovery is fast or slow, V shaped or U shaped, over the next few quarters, it doesn't really impact us that much. Under very fast paced recovery, we end up down 15% for the full year, and margins are 19% to 21%. They're much slower recovery, revenues are down 25%. Yet, our margins are still a very strong 17% to 19%. This is against a backdrop, where most of the companies that our divisions compete with came into the pandemic, with margins at half of ours or less. As a result, a number of them may have to retrench in a major way in order to get through the epidemic, potentially creating some significant share gain opportunities for us in the recovery. With our margin cushion, we are concerned with how quickly demand is going to recover in Q3 or Q4. We can be fairly certain that it will be incrementally better than Q2. But beyond that, it really doesn't affect us a whole lot, which allows us to think long-term and positioned for maximum participation in the recovery, making sure that we are in a strong position to fully support our customers, as their businesses begin to re accelerate, and that we are in an equally strong position to take share from competitors, who can't, is the central imperative of our pandemic response planning for every one of our divisions. We will, of course, need to manage our businesses smartly across our portfolio and make some meaningful capacity and cost structure adjustments in businesses, where we expect prolonged recovery periods, or maybe even permanent demand impacts from the pandemic. But as we always do, we will leave those decisions in the hands of our divisional leaders as they are in the best position to assess the pace and slope of the cut of the recovery in each of their respective businesses. Turning to slide 11. The financial benefits of our enterprise strategy, combined with the work done to optimize our capital efficiency, capital structure and capital allocation over the years, has put ITW in a very strong position going into this crisis. At quarter end, we have more than $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand. At the end of Q1 and it's still the case. As of today, we have essentially no short-term debt. And we have not issued any commercial paper. Why you might ask? Simply put, because we don't need to cash. We have a $2.5 billion undrawn credit facility available to us, if needed in the future bring our total liquidity to about $4 billion as we sit here today. Our net leverage is only 1.7 times and our next maturity is pretty small, $350 million and not until September 2021. High quality of earnings and strong free cash flow are hallmarks of ITW. As you know, we consistently generate significantly more cash than we need for internal purposes. And our annual conversion rate from net income is consistently above 100%. We expect that to continue to be the case, as we manage our way through the pandemic. As evidenced by Tier 1 credit ratings that are the highest in our peer group, we continue to have excellent access to credit markets in the event that we needed. During this time of market volatility, it's also worth mentioning that our pension plans, have remained in great shape. Over the years, we have consistently funded and de risked our plans. And as we sit here today, our largest U.S. plan is funded at 104%. Turning to slide 12. So how do we think about and adjust our capital allocation approach during the pandemic? First, with regard to the dividend. We recognize the importance of ITW's dividend to our long term shareholders. We have a long history, with more than 56 years of growing the dividend. And we are part of a small group of so-called dividend aristocrats, and one of about 18 companies that has increased its dividend for more than 50 years. And we view the dividend as a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Since 2012, we have increased the annualized dividend from $1.52 per share to currently $4.28 per share, a cumulative annual growth rate of 16%. Simply put, we remain strongly committed to our dividend and as we sit here today, we do not see a scenario where we would have to reduce the dividend. In terms of strategic optionality, we are clearly in a position of strength, with ample balance sheet capacity. And we're certainly open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of the pandemic. It could be in the form of more reasonable valuation opportunities for assets that we were already interested in, as well as some unique opportunities with quality companies that may not have the financial strength to weather the pandemic. Given our financial strength and ample capacity, we will be in a strong position to react to any high quality strategic opportunities that may emerge. We will continue to fully fund all internal investment and CapEx projects that meet our criteria, like we always have, but the number will likely come down in terms of aggregate spend in the near term, simply due to the fact that we don't need any capacity expansion projects for the next several quarters. Finally, I think, it comes as no surprise to anyone that we have suspended share repurchases until end markets stabilize and the recovery path becomes clearer. With that, I'll turn it back over to Scott. I might just add Ann, if you specific to oil and gas, if you look at the enterprise level, our sales into oil and gas are in the no single-digits and maybe as you were pointing out, primarily in welding, maybe 15% to 20% of welding depending on what year you're in, primarily on the international side. But as Scott said, it's really too early to tell what the recovery path might look like in that part of the company. Yeah I think, Andy, as we pointed out the hardest hit segment as you might expect is the one that we're calling out specifically with automotive down 60% to 70%. And I think as you called out, that is a 10 point drag on our overall enterprise top line. So if you were to say ex-auto, we -- balance of the businesses is down in that 20% to 30% range. Food equipment certainly one of the more challenged businesses here in the short term, particularly in the restaurant side, without going into too much detail, but we're seeing a lot more resilience in food within on the institutional side, whether it'd be health care or education as well as on the retail side, as you might imagine. So, but overall food equipment will certainly be more challenge than the average, probably down in that 35% to 45% range here in the in the near term, and recovery will depend on all the things that you're aware of in terms of when these restaurants are able to open back up again, when we're able to co service the equipment and so forth. Welding certainly challenged on the CapEx side. We talked a lot about the oil and gas exposure their. Welding would be down probably in line with the average of the company and then from there, there's some pretty good resilience in places like testing measurements, specialties and will probably be down in that 10% to 20% range. So, I think this is as difficult of Q2 as certainly, we've seen and it happened that as you know, very quickly. And I'll just point back to the overall profitability of the company. I mean, even with these numbers I just went through, we are going to be very profitable. We're going to generate more than $0.5 billion of free cash flow. We'll have at the enterprise level, double digit operating margins. There'll be higher than some of our peers going into before this whole, pre COVID situation. So it's a real position of strength, even with this macro shock that we're dealing with, we'll get through the near term and, we'll be much stronger when we come out the other end. So, that's kind of my segment a little bit of detail for you. April is tracking. I think we had a forecast going into -- we developed early. April, we thought we'd be down 30% to 40%. And April is tracking. April will \u2013 April and May, will be difficult months. There are some indications that things are starting to improve. I think Scott mentioned by region, China, for example, we had a bottom probably in the month of February down in the mid 30s. And April was flat so, in the automotive business might be flat in Q2 here in China. So, there's certainly some early signs that things have bottomed here in April and May, like I said difficult and then we'll see June. But obviously, all of this with the usual caveats. This is a highly uncertain situation. But, I'd say, as we sit here today, I'm pretty confident that we're seeing the worst of it right now. And we'll get through this. And we'll see what the second half of the year is going to look like in terms of recovery. Yeah. Thanks for the kind words, Jeff. I mean I think this was a good example in Q1 of what Scott was talking about that nobody is sitting around in our divisions that are waiting for somebody to tell them what to do. They react quickly -- the team reacts quickly when they see changes in demand. And so I think with revenues down 9%, the fact that margins were flat up in five or seven segments, the big driver continues to be, for us, after seven-plus years, the enterprise initiatives at 120 basis points. And price cost, no longer an issue for us. And then, of course, the volume leverage, we were able to offset some pretty meaningful headwind there to hold margins flat. So we expect the enterprise initiatives to continue as we go through the year. With lower volume, the overall contribution might be a little less than what you've seen in Q1 and last year in the 100-plus range, but it will still be a meaningful lever within our own control as we go through the worst of it here in Q2 and then head into the recovery in Q3 and Q4. I don't know if you want to talk about anything specifically. But by segment, the biggest driver is -- remains enterprise initiatives in that 70 to 160 basis points range by segment. And like I said, we expect that to continue to be a meaningful contribution as we go forward. Right. Historically. You just answered your own question. So that's exactly right. I know it's a nice try. It's a nice try. I mean, like I said earlier, we just don't know yet. I mean -- and this is not -- with this company is a bottoms-up company and the restructuring will be what our VP, GMs and division leadership teams decide that they need to do once they have a clearer view of what the demand picture is. At that point, we have plenty of capacity and funding for all the investments we want to make, and -- including some of the restructuring that maybe required as we go forward. So, -- but that's really the best I can give you right now. That's fair. I think the math... Bye David."

            "name": "Chris O'Herlihy",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. This is a challenging time for all of us, as the world continues to grapple with the effects of a global pandemic. At this point, I'm sure that every one of us has been impacted by this situation, in ways that were unimaginable just a few months ago. And ITW as a company and the community is certainly being affected. Having said that, and Scott reference, or divisional leaders think and act like owners, are able to react quickly and take the necessary actions to protect our people and serve our customers, which is a particular advantage of the company, in times of significant challenge. Let's move to slide 6. The actions were taken to protect the health and support, the well being of our colleagues. We developed and deployed a number of practices to minimize exposure. And prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep our colleagues safe. We have followed CDC, WHO, and local government guidelines in doing so. Out ITW colleagues have redesigned production processes to ensure proper social distancing practices, adjusted shift schedules and assignments that have colleagues who have childcare needs, due to school closings and implemented aggressive new water and sanitation practices, to minimize infection risk. We're also providing full compensation to employees, who have been quarantined. In addition, our strategic sourcing team is heavily engaged in helping our businesses, by coordinating the procurement of personal protective equipment, to ensure all our employees receive the protection they need. I'm pleased to say, that as a result of our containment efforts, to this point we've largely been able to restrict infections to single cases, in a minority of our locations, which is a testament to the actions our colleagues have taken to implement sound sanitation practices and social distancing and to protect one another, to the best of their abilities. Turning to slide 7, let's shipped to another important stakeholder group and how we continue to serve our customers with excellence. To support our customers, our teams have worked diligently to keep our factories open and operating safely. In areas around the world where governments have issued shelter in place orders, the vast majority of ITW businesses have been designated as critical or essential businesses. And as such, they're needed to really an open and operational. In some cases, it's because our products directly impact, the COVID-19 response effort. For example, our welding equipment is used to manufacture hospital beds or structural products are utilized to build temporary medical facilities, or test and measurement products test medical and laboratory equipment. Our Polymers & Fluids products sanitize workplaces. And our food service equipment is used to feed people in hospitals. In other cases, our businesses are designated as critical, because they play a vital role in serving and supporting industries. They're essential to the physical and economic health of our communities. Although, some facilities are subject to mandatory shutdowns, roughly 95% of our global manufacturing capacity is currently available to be deployed to serve our customers. The same is true for our service networks, particularly in food equipment and test and measurement, which we continue to keep fully available in order to ensure that we can help keep essential businesses and healthcare facilities in operation. In both cases, across all segments, we continue to maintain best-in-class performance for product and service quality and the availability. Finally, we're rigorously managing our supplier base to both mitigate near-term supply risk for critical raw materials and components and ensure that we are positioned to win in a wide range recovery scenarios going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael. Yeah. Absolutely, I mean, I think the honest answer is until we know what the recovery path looks like, and the divisions have had a chance to really interpret, you know, division-by-division, what that path is, and therefore, what capacity and cost, adjustments need to be made. We don't know what the restructuring is going to be. But obviously, we have included in the numbers that we're showing you today, a placeholder for an educated guess I hope for what restructuring might be. But it really is. John, as you might appreciate, too early to tell at this point. Thanks John. Thank you, Andrew. Same to you. Yes. So if we think about food equipment and specifically with the restaurant side of the business, 25%, 30% of our business, and the recovery there is going to not just depend on lifting of shelter and place restrictions, but also in terms of core shelter and place, what additional restrictions will be on the business in terms of occupancy and so on. Clearly, a very, very uncertain environment. It's very difficult to predict what that will look like. But for us, we are somewhat comfortable by the fact that the other parts of our business, as Michael mentioned, the institutional piece, particularly health care, higher education is doing quite well. Retail is doing quite well, as you would expect. The typical deli counter business is thriving right now. We are being slightly a little bit in terms of being able to put in installations because they are so busy, but the long-term demand trends there are pretty healthy. And in service is the other business where we continue to, to Scott's point, keep our service organization fully employed here. I mean we've taken a huge investment over the years in ensuring that we had a highly developed, highly trained service force. And the last thing we want to do is let those folks go, acknowledging that even though capacity is down right now, that will recover in the medium term. Yeah. So Andy, so with respect to the supply chain, no major issues to date for us with suppliers or some of the -- obviously, an issue we're managing very closely. We would feel certainly that our produce where we sell approach has served us pretty well here. We would also say that the fact that already centralized helps us to provide -- helps us as it provides 80 different kind of touch points, which enables us to kind of stay well informed and react quickly. So something we're rigorously managing, as we talked about in the presentation and not seeing any issues right now, but something we're very attuned to."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. Stating the obvious, a lot has changed relative to the environment we operated in for most of the first quarter. As a result, our focus this morning will be on the company's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and, more specifically, our strategy to leverage ITW's considerable strengths in executing on the challenges and opportunities ahead. I will provide some brief commentary on our Q1 performance, and then we will transition to our pandemic strategy. We have included much of our normal quarterly performance detail in the appendix and you are of course, welcomed to ask questions regarding our Q1 results during the Q&A session at the conclusion of our presentation. As Karen noted, I've asked our Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy to join Michael and me on the call this morning, as I thought that it would be helpful for you to hear perspectives from all three of us and how we are managing through the near-term challenges of the containment period we're currently in and on the actions we are taking now and will take over the coming weeks and months to ensure that the company is positioned to participate fully in the recovery.  Before we jump in, I want to offer our heartfelt thanks to all of our ITW colleagues around the world. We talk often about the fact that our decentralized entrepreneurial culture is a key element of ITW's secret sauce. It is core to who we are as a company, and it is never more valuable than during times of significant and in this case, rapid change. The proactive teamwork, ingenuity and selflessness of our people and quickly adapting to rapidly changing conditions and tackling new challenges that seemingly arise daily at the moment is ITW at its finest. We thank all of our colleagues for the incredible level of care and commitment they are bringing to keeping their co-workers safe, while continuing to serve our customers with excellence. The fact that the ITW team has responded exactly as we expected they would doesn't make it any less extraordinary. Now on to first quarter results, total revenue declined 9% year on year with organic revenue down 6.6%, currency at 1.5% headwind, a negative 1% impact from divestitures and 40 basis points of PLS.  The majority of the organic revenue decline occurred in the last two weeks of March where we saw organic revenue down more than 20%. By geography, North America was down 5% and Europe was down 7%, China was down 24% for the quarter, but appears to have bottomed in February and was flat year on year in April. An encouraging sign. In the face of a challenging demand environment, we continue to execute well on the elements within our control. Despite a 9% decline in revenues, operating margin was flat at 23.6%, 5 of our 7 segments expanded margins in the quarter due largely to benefits from enterprise initiatives which contributed 120 basis points to operating margin at the enterprise level. After tax return on invested capital is 27% and free cash flow was $554 million with a conversion rate of 98% of net income. Lastly, as noted in our press release this morning, given the uncertainties regarding the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are suspending our previously announced guidance for full year 2020. We will resume guidance once and market stabilized and the recovery path becomes more clear.  Now let's shift gears and talk about how we will manage ITW through the global pandemic. Please turn to slide 4. Despite the unusual and in some cases unprecedented challenges of the moment, we continue to execute at a high level and with our usual degree of focus and discipline across the company. As a result of all the work we have done over the last 7 years in executing our enterprise strategy and the progress we have made on the path to our full potential performance, ITW is today in a position of significant strength in dealing with the effects of the global pandemic.  Today's ITW is centered on our powerful and proprietary business model and our people are better trained and more skilled at executing it than ever before in the history of our company. ITW is 80/20 front to back methodology and the laser light focus that drives on the relative handful of critical performance, difference makers, and every one of our businesses has served the company extremely well in times of both opportunity and challenge for a long time now. I have no doubt that this unique ITW skill will be a significant asset to us as we work our way through the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are very fortunate to have a decentralized operating structure and an entrepreneurial culture that has been developed, nurtured, and protected over many years. Our people think and act like owners. They are accountable and they deliver. They are deeply trained in our business model, our strategy and our values and I assure you that even in an unprecedented times such as these, none of them are waiting around to be told what to do. In addition, in today's ITW, we have worked hard in shaping our portfolio and driving consistent high quality execution across every business in it, both to position the company to deliver consistent upper tier long term earnings growth, when global conditions are favorable and to build in a margin cushion and level of diversification, that makes us highly resilient during most periods when they are not. And it follows from there that the robust free cash flow we generate through our strong margin profile, and the unique attributes of our business model, combined with our very, disciplined capital allocation strategy, gives us an extremely strong balance sheet and Tier 1 credit ratings. So with these elements is our foundation, our strategy for managing through the pandemic and its aftermath is to focus, on the following four priorities. First, to protect the health and support the well being of our ITW colleagues, second, to continue to serve our customers with excellence, third, to maintain financial strength, liquidity and strategic optionality and fourth, to leverage ITW strengths to position the company to fully participate, in the recovery. Chris will give you some additional color on priorities one and two. Michael will cover priority three and I will come back and cover priority four. And then, we'll open it up for your questions, Chris. Good morning, over to you. Thank you, Michael. And as a priority four, which is all about leveraging our strengths to make sure that every one of our businesses are strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery. In short, we are going to be there to serve every bit of our customers' needs as their businesses begin to reaccelerate and be well prepared to capture any share gain opportunities that may come our way.  Food equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2% year-over-year despite a tough comp of 5% organic growth last year. The service business was solid up 4% in the quarter. Equipment growth of 1% reflects double-digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year-over-year comps for both of those. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5% with enterprise initiatives, the main contributor. Test and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6% with 13% growth in our Instron business. The segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers. Electronics was up 2%. Margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record, 28.1% the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage. Also in the quarter, we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $60 million. In the face of an unprecedented demand contraction in Q2, as Michael commented earlier, we will still generate operating income in the hundreds of million dollars and generate over $500 million in free cash flow. We will manage discretionary expenses prudently, but we don't need to start cutting muscle immediately. And we certainly want to avoid doing so, before we have some level of indication as to the shape and slope of the recovery in each of our businesses. With this principle in mind, to this point, we are providing full compensation and benefits support to all ITW colleagues around the world. And we're going to do our best to sustain that level of support for all of our people through at least the end of Q2. We are doing it because we are in a position to support our people at a time of great personal and family stress and uncertainty. And we think that it's the right thing to do. But we're also doing it to protect the significant investment we have made in training and developing great ITW people and great ITW leaders over the past seven years. As Michael mentioned, it is likely that we will need to make some staffing adjustments to align with prolonged or permanently lower demand in some of our businesses as a result of the pandemic. So we are committed to being there for all of our people during the worst of this, and we will take the time to make whatever longer-term adjustments need to be made thoughtfully. The second principle is that we're going to lean into the upside by remaining invested in structure to capture incremental demand. Given the profitability of our core businesses in the strength of our financial position, what's the bigger risk for ITW, carrying more cost and it turns out we need for a few months or cutting too much and not being able to fully serve the needs of our customers and take share from our competitors as the recovery accelerates. Obviously, we believe short sheet and the upside potential of the recovery would be the far bigger mistake for ITW. And we're going to plan and execute our recovery strategies accordingly. The third principle is that we're going to leverage the strength of ITW to protect investment in areas of strategic importance to the execution of our long-term strategy. We're early in our planning around all these areas. But as one example, prior to the pandemic, we invested two plus years in our strategic sales excellence initiative that included significant investments in new sales and sales leadership talent. We have the financial capacity to protect these types of long-term strategic investments. And doing so is worth a lot more over the long-term to the company, there are a few extra detrimental margin points in the short-term. That being said, decremental margins should likely be in our normal 35% to 40% range in Q4. Between now and then, we're going to focus on making sure ITW is in a strong position to fully participate in the recovery. Turning to slide 14, this is just a reminder that our long-term strategic priorities remain unchanged that we are committed to achieving and sustaining ITW potential performance, and continuing on our quest to firmly establish ITW as one of the world's best performing, highest quality, and most respected industrial companies. Now let's move on to slide 15 to wrap things up. Once again on behalf of Chris, Michael and I, and our entire executive leadership team, we thank our ITW colleagues around the world for the exceptional job they are doing under the most challenging circumstances. As of right now, there's no way to know how severe this crisis will be, how long it will last, or how quickly our customers and then markets will recover. What I do know is that the strength and resilience of ITW's business model and our people put us in about a stronger position as an industrial manufacturing company can be in, to deal with that whatever will unfold over the coming weeks and months. I have every confidence that ITW will rise to the challenges we always have over the course of our 108-year history. Our strong financial position and margin profile give us the ability to make strategic moves now to position the company to fully participate across a range of recovery scenarios, and to come out the other side ready to continue on our path to ITW full potential performance. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. I'd say and overall, it's just way too early to tell. I think, I don't see anything you know, we have a division that provides support equipment to the airline industry is probably among the ones that I would say would see kind of the longest tail in terms of recovery. But from where we sit today, as early as it is in this whole process, it's I don't \u2013 I don't see anything that that would be sort of obvious or apparent in terms of permanent change or damage, if you will, from this pandemic. There may be but we'll deal with it. Well, I think there is no, this is no, nothing I would characterize as a change in strategy, we had certainly talked for some time about the addition of some incremental growth from acquisitions as a core part of our strategy. I think there's, you know, it's not rocket science to anticipate that there are going to be either from the standpoint of a reset on valuation and/or given the level of financial stress its going to be out there that there might be some opportunities emerge as a result in our own commentary is that we are going to preserve our ability to access those that doesn't change the criteria one but this is not a matter of looking at things that we would have not looked at otherwise, but the sort of relative availability of things that would fit \u2013 I would expect would be perhaps more enhanced as a result of the situation. Yeah, well, I'm not sure I would limit it based on size. I think it's a function of stick with that strategy. Obviously, we've talked about that criteria in the past and we've got an opportunity that kind of business that has high value add content in terms of their products and the way their products impact their customers, and where we see a significant ability to impact the performance of a business through the application of our business model. That's what I'm saying is the same as it's always been. Whether that's big or small, will be a function of the quality of the asset less than the size. Good morning I'm trying to interpret the question. I think, John, I think if I'm going to paraphrase here, I think you're asking, what is included from a restructuring standpoint for the balance of the year? Yeah. And I think the sort of core planning mandate around this and everything we've just tried to articulate is we're going to spend the next couple of quarters really making sure that we're in the right position to fully support our customers and access any incremental growth opportunities that might emerge from this recovery phase. And we'll \u2013 we'll do what we always do. We'll adjust our cost structure smartly. We're not going to do it through some, either from on high we're going to do it business-by-business. That's no different than we've always done it. The difference now is that, we are have positioned from the standpoint of entry margins and the final cushion that we have is we can take the time to plan our way through it in a way that doesn't necessarily does our best to protect The upside potential next really all we're saying, I said in my comments that, we'll be back to our normal incremental by Q4. But there's really no benefit to us that I see of trying to as I said, when the \u2013 when the containment phase and you know, how fast we can cut costs is not is not something that we have to worry about, we have the luxury of building this position doesn't mean, we're not going to be smart. It doesn't mean, we're not going to have to adjust our cost structure over time, but we're going to do it from a position of much greater clarity business by businesses to how this is likely going to play out. That clarity doesn't exist today. It's very hard to see until we get much further down through Q2 and into Q3. We're just trying to be the same. Thank you. I see no reason why they wouldn't be our normal 35 plus. Well, I, I'd say a couple of things, specifically around Q2. One is, certainly in auto and -- what's going on in restaurants right now, food equipment and the whole sort of CapEx environment, why would most companies are certainly pulling back big time in any sort of CapEx until they have more clarity as to what the future will hold. What I would say also is in Q2 that's certainly a significant multiplier is all the supply chain, the brakes go on, there's a multiplying effect of both. Beyond just the consumption of whatever the products are. It's related to the reduction, radical reduction in inventories to supportive, significant double-digit drop. So I'm not sure there's a lot of comparisons to the market and that valid and Q2 for that reason. Let's get through it. Let the smoke clear a little bit and see how things are starting to normalize in Q3 before we make any assessments in terms of relative growth. We used to give Q2 run rate we don't quit. Yeah. Let me ask Michael address for April and sort of the relative Q2 performance across the segment. Sure, thanks. Well, I think this is certainly -- I'm not sure. Certainly, from my own perspective, how much past history is really relevant and valid. We're a very different company today than we were under -- in any prior contraction. And I would say, the other element is, this is a harder, faster, more challenging decline than any of us -- anybody's ever been through. So from the standpoint of the kinds of potential impacts it may have on a number of companies and what that might do ultimately to -- think about sort of the hard crash in a relatively robust kind of recovery, there's going to be a lot of -- you're going to have to be able to respond quickly all the way through the supply chain, not just your own capacity. So there's going to be a lot of challenges around. All of that, depending on different industries and how they ultimately recover in the pace. So I can't certainly predict or say that we have any view that one part of our company is going to be more ripe for those kinds of opportunities than others at this particular stage. What I am saying is, we're going to be prepared in every one of our businesses to be there, to be able to seize those opportunities if and when they emerge. And I think that's all I can say. We are -- I think we've done a lot of work on the portfolio, to say there's any part of our portfolio that we don't want to grow incrementally at this point, and it is not the way I would characterize it. I would also say that we're not going to -- we're not interested in superficial gains here. We're interested in share gains in areas where we're already focused. That's it. The way we're trying to serve and grow our positions in these markets for the long haul. So, we're not going to be looking for a quick sale and bailing out a competitor in an area that's not of interest to us long term. And that's a lot of what we're going through in the planning right now, is to not only make sure we have the capacity to support those incremental opportunities, but to make sure that our divisions have real clarity in terms of exactly where they're looking to grab those opportunities and where they're not. Thank you. Well, yes, I think it's harder to sort of characterize in one description a range of scenarios, but I do think the productive capacity is actually a big part of it, that as these markets turn, to the extent you haven't kept cushion in your supply chain, cushion in your capacity. Again, you can have the machines sitting around, but if you don't have the people there, you don't have the suppliers there ready to go, think about a scenario where we're in the second quarter, businesses in an industry is going to be down 30%. If it's down only 15% in Q3, that's a sequential improvement at a clip like nobody ever attest to manage before. And so I think those are -- I wouldn't discount your ability to deliver and supply as a core part of where these opportunities might emerge. And then service? Good morning. I can frame it. The big difference between Q1 and Q2 is the magnitude of the revenue decline, right? So we handled 9% decline in Q1, 7% organic. And certainly, those business level tactical adjustments, as Michael said, showed up very strong. The difference in Q2 is the magnitude of revenue decline is significantly greater. Those tactical adjustments are still there and ongoing. That's what when we talk about managing the business prudently, all of that is still in place. But we're also saying to our businesses, let's not react to this Q2 -- unprecedented Q2 that's not going to be reality beyond Q2. And we've -- as we've talked about a number of different levels here, we're going to preserve our ability to structure ourselves appropriately going forward and not react or overreact to the short-term conditions in Q2. Could the decrementals be better in Q2 if we wanted to drive something at that? Sure. But do we think that's the right thing to do for our company? Absolutely not. 100%? 100%. Good morning, Andy. And I think that, we've always been a source-local company. So from the standpoint of the diversity of our supply base that we are not dependent on one source relationships of finance globally, that we've got some level of risk mitigation and ability to shift and or go down. I would say that, we have almost no visibility in near-term, in terms of how inventories have been adjusted. I think it's a safe assumption to say that, anybody in the distribution business is certainly managing that aspect of their business very carefully. And ultimately, again, there are -- there's a sort of magnitude of decline and potentially magnitude of correction the other way that there are going to be factors here in terms of how companies are positioned to ultimately handle it. But I don't think we have any ability to say whether inventories are too high or too low still in the channel across most of our businesses at this point. It's still challenged. And I mean, I think the closest you can get to talking about something stabilized are the data points that we provided on China were like I said, you know, in February, our sales were down I think 36% was the number and in April were flat. So that's probably the best I can give you. I think as we look at the regional numbers here, for Q2, total company is down 30 to 40, North America will probably be at the lower end of that in terms of down in that 25% to 35% range. And Europe will be higher than that and then China, like we said, flat for the quarter, maybe a little bit better, but, not to get into a sort of pick and choose situation. But, I would say, often things are not as bad in some cases, as any of us expected. It's not terrible. It's a unique situation. But we've got parts of our portfolio that are certainly stabilizing. And I'm thinking of some elements of business that are certainly there. They're all under some challenge, but if I want to -- I don't know to look at that we're still serving customers. And yeah, we're still in business. So we'll get through it. Thank you. Good morning. I don't know if that changes a whole lot. We are highly automated in certain parts of the company because that's the right thing for the business in terms of not just the cost productivity, but also the level of quality that we need to build in the product. We have, -- as we've talked about forever, we have never been constrained from the standpoint of capital investments. So I don't know that I have any view that says because of the pandemic, we're going to have a shift in strategy under -- within the framework of 80/20, front to back in our business model. I think certainly, that business model helps us a great deal as we work our way through. A lot of the issues and challenges that will come about, but it doesn't \u2013 I'm trying to think about your question, I can't think of anything fine. Yeah. And I was going to say the -- all the projects and activities that add up to the enterprise initiative savings, those projects are still there. So, you know, nothing's really changed from that standpoint. I think we're got to let the smoke clear a little bit here to answer your question. I don't know, I certainly -- will there be some businesses that there's some fundamental change in the overall demand profile based on the impact of the pandemic. I'm sure across 85 divisions; we'll have some of that. We'll have some others that will have -- as we've talked about a lot, some incremental growth opportunities that will have to support with some investments. So we'll get to all that stuff. It's really hard sitting here in \u2013 ...in the early May, given all this going on there. We need to have any clarity view or that. Good morning. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I can only speak for ITW in that regard, largely, which is that we have always been a produce where we sell company and we've talked about that often. And so from the standpoint of how any of this impacts our footprint from the standpoint of where we produce and where we source none of this changes any of that. I certainly think that there is likely to be, directionally, more movement for all the reasons you talked about amongst global manufacturers around localizing their production. I think there's certainly are going to be some lessons learned from the standpoint of the need to balance both lowest cost, the low-cost, lowest cost country sourcing, lowest cost with resilience, and redundancy. And so I absolutely think that will play itself out. From our standpoint, I don't know that, that presents any more or less opportunities. We're serving our customers globally. We'll certainly, perhaps, affect some of our supply points into those customers from a geography standpoint, but none of it that's going to have -- that I would say would result in any significant shift for us one way or the other."

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Brent. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. With me today are Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thanks Karen and good morning, everyone. In Q4 ITW team delivered another quarter of excellent operational execution and strong financial performance. Six of our seven segments combined and delivered 12% organic growth while our auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near term limitations on auto productions due to component supply shortages and as a result was down 16% in the quarter. At the enterprise level we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP EPS of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7% and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income. Throughout the entirety of 2021, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering to our customers while responding quickly indecisively to rapidly rising input cost and aggressively executing our win the recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. As a result for the full year, we generated organic growth of 12% with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from 6% to 18% and despite a seemingly constant rise of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1% with another 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. GAAP EPS was an all time record at $8.51, an increase of 28% versus the prior year. And in 2021, we also raised our dividend by 7%, returned $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and closed on a very high quality acquisition in the MTS test and stimulation business. Most importantly we delivered these results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on our path to ITW\u2019s full potential through the execution of our long term enterprise strategy. As you may recall, early in the pandemic we made the decisions to remain fully invested in our people and in our long term strategy. The people that we retained in the marketing innovation and capacity investments that we continue to fund as a result of that decision are fueling the results that ITW is delivering today and have the company very well-positioned to continue to accelerate organic growth, add high quality bolt on acquisitions and sustain our best in class margins and returns in 2022 and beyond. I want to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication. Their performance throughout 2021 provides another proof point that ITW is a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, the agility and the resilience necessary to deliver top tier performance in any environment. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on our Q4 and full year 2021 performance as well as our 2022 guidance. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. The strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year to $3.7 billion with organic growth of 5.3%. The MTS acquisition added 1.3% and foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 0.7%. Sequentially, organic revenue accelerated by 6% from Q3 into Q4 on our sales per day basis, as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%. By geography, North America grew 9% and international was up 1%. Europe declined 2% while Asia-Pacific was up 7% with China up 2%. GAAP EPS of $1.93 included $0.02 of headwind from the MTS acquisition and related transaction costs. Operating margin was 22.7% to 23.1% excluding MTS. As expected in the fourth quarter, we experienced price cost margin headwinds of 200 basis points, the same as in the third quarter. Our businesses continued to respond appropriately and decisively to rising raw material costs and in the fourth quarter and the full year, we were positive on dollar for dollar basis. Overall for Q4 excellent operational execution across the board and strong financial performance in what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment. Okay, let\u2019s go to slide 4 for segment results starting with automotive OEM. As expected organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 12%, Europe down 29% and China down 3%. Despite these near term pressures on the top line, operating margin was resilient and remained solidly in the mid teens. While supply chain challenges continue to persist for the industry in the near term, we are confident that the inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major contributor to organic growth for ITW over an extended period of time as these issues ultimately get resolved. Food equipment led the way this quarter with the highest organic growth rate inside the company at 21%. North America was up 22% with equipment up 26% and service up 15%. Institutional growth of 28% was particularly strong education and restaurants were up around 50%. International growth was strong and on par with North America at 20% mostly driven by Europe up 23% with Asia-Pacific up 9%. Both equipment and service grew 20%. Turning to slide 5 for test and measurement and electronics. Organic growth was 11% with electronics up 4% and test and measurement up 17% driven by continued strong demand for semiconductors and capital equipment as evidenced by organic growth rate of 17% in our Instron business. Scott said in December, we closed on the MTS acquisition which we\u2019re excited about as it\u2019s a great strategic fit for ITW and highly complementary to our Instron business. We acquired the Instron in 2006 and today it is a business growing consistently at 6% to 7% organically with operating margins well above the company average. We\u2019re confident that MTS has the potential to reach similar levels of performance over the next five to seven years through the application of the ITW business model. Moving to slide 6. Welding delivered broad based organic revenue growth of 15% with 30% operating margin in Q4. Equipment revenue grew 14% and consumables were up 16%. Industrial revenue grew 18% and the commercial business grew 8%. North America was up 15% and International growth was 14% driven by 18% growth in oil and gas. Polymers and fluids organic growth was 3% with 8% growth in polymers with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Fluids was down 5% against the tough comp of plus 16% last year when demand for industrial hygiene products surged. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with continued strength in retail. Onto slide 7. Construction organic revenue was up 12% as North America grew 22% with residential renovation up 23% driven by continued strength in the home center channel. Commercial construction which is about 20% of our business was up 21%. Europe grew 2% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%. Specialty organic growth was strong at 7% with North America up 10% and International up 2%. With that let\u2019s go to slide 8 for a summary of 2021. Operationally, the teams around the world continue to execute with discipline in a challenging environment as they sustained world class customer service levels, implemented timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs and executed on our win the recovery initiatives to accelerate organic growth across the portfolio. As a result, revenue grew 15% to $14.5 billion with broad based organic growth of 12%, 14% if you exclude auto OEM where growth was obviously very constrained due to two component shortages at our customers. Operating income increased 21% and operating margin was 24.1%. Incremental margin was 32%, which is below our typical 35% to 40% range due to price costs. Excluding the impact of price cost, incremental margin was 40%. GAAP EPS increased 28% and after tax ROIC improved by more than 300 basis points to 29.5%. Free cash flow was $2.3 billion with a conversion rate of 84% of net income, which is below our 100% plus long term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company\u2019s 15% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. Moving to slide 9 for our full year 2022 guidance. So, we\u2019re heading into 2022 with strong momentum and the company is in a very good position to deliver another year of strong financial performance with organic growth of 6% to 9% and 10% to 15% earnings growth. For our usual process, our organic growth guidance is established by projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. As you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in 2022 with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level. Our total revenue growth projection of 7.5% to 10.5% includes a 3% contribution from MTS partially offset by 1.5% of foreign currency headwind at today\u2019s exchange rates. Specific to MTS, guidance includes full year revenue of $400 million to $450 million. The expectation that margins are dilutive at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and finally, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before EPS neutral. Operating margin excluding MTS is forecast to expand by about 100 basis points to 24.5% to 25.5% as enterprise initiatives contribute approximately 100 basis points. We expect price cost headwind of about 50 basis points. Incremental margin is expected to be about 30%, including MTS and our core incremental margin excluding MTS is in our typical 35% to 40% range. We expect GAAP EPS in the range of $8.90 to $9.30 which is up 10% to 15% excluding onetime tax items from last year. The tax rate for 2022 is expected to be 23% to 24% as compared to 19% in 2021. We are forecasting solid free cash flow with a conversion rate of 90% to 100% of net income with further working capital investments to support the company\u2019s growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers as needed. Our capital allocation plans for 2022 are consistent with our longstanding disciplined capital allocation framework. Priority number one remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our highly profitable core businesses. Second, an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time remains a critical component of ITW\u2019s total shareholder return model. Third, selective high quality acquisitions such as MTS that enhance ITW\u2019s long term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement potential from the application of our proprietary 80:20 front to back methodology and can generate acceptable risk adjusted returns on our shareholders capital. Lastly, we allocate surplus capital to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buyback $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2022. In addition, we have reactivated our previously announced divestiture plans and in 2022, we will reinitiate divestiture processes for five businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $500 million. While these businesses are performing quite well, coming out of the pandemic, they operate in markets where growth expectations are not aligned with ITW\u2019s long term organic growth goals. When these divestitures are completed over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect approximately 50 basis points of lift to ITW\u2019s organic growth rate and operating margins. Given the timing uncertainties associated with these divestiture transactions, 2022 guidance assumes we own them for the full year. Finally, last slide is Slide 10 with the organic growth projections by segment. You can see that based on current run rates we\u2019re expecting some solid organic growth rates in every one of our seven segments with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level. For automotive OEM, our guidance of 6% to 10% is based on a risk adjusted forecast of automotive production in the mid single digits plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%. With that Karen, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Michael. Brent, let\u2019s open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi Group. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So Mike, I know you mentioned that you\u2019re predicting to run rate growth as you usually do. But it looks like polymers and fluids are the only segment where you actually forecast the business to reaccelerate in 22 versus Q4 levels. Maybe you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing there and then it seems like your CapEx businesses continue to be quite strong. Are you seeing customers step up CapEx in 22? And how does that factor into the forecast if at all?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think polymers and fluids is really the growth rate for 2022 is established the same way as the other segments, which is based on current levels of demand inside of the segment today projected into 2022 and adjusted for typical seasonality. So that\u2019s where you get to that 5% to 9% range for polymers and fluids. On the CapEx question I\u2019d say, we definitely continue to see very strong demand in our capital equipment businesses. We talked about an acceleration from Q3 into Q4 with revenue per day of 6%, when normally we\u2019re only up 2% and we expect really that strong demand to continue into 2022. Again, we\u2019re not assuming an acceleration in 2022. It\u2019s based on current run rates but based on the trends we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s possible that we fully expect that demand will continue at these levels. We\u2019ve seen nothing in Q4 to suggest that demand is slowing down in any one of our segments.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate that. And then you delivered mid teens margins in auto in Q4 which I think was in line with expectations. But as you know, steel prices have begun to come down. So can you give us more color and how to think about margin in auto in 22 and when you talk about your ability, I think he talked last quarter about maybe being able to re-price some auto OEM contracts. So have you had any success in doing that?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think on auto margins, they\u2019ve been remarkably resilient, considering that we\u2019ve been down 15% to 20% in Q3 and Q4 and we\u2019re still in that mid to high teen level. Obviously, as auto production comes back, we\u2019re going to get positive volume leverage in the business. Price cost remains a significant headwind and it\u2019s not so much steel is really more on the resin side in the auto business and we expect that those headwinds will continue in 2022 in the auto business. As we\u2019ve talked about before getting priced takes a little bit longer in the in this space, just given the contractual nature of the industry. And we are continuing to partner with our customers as we renew contracts and add new content to vehicles and so I do think that longer term structurally auto margins will go back to levels that we\u2019re at historically which is in the low to mid 20s. When exactly that happens really depends on when volume comes back and when we get ahead of these price cost headwinds that are pretty significant at this point.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, Michael. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe we could just start with thinking about the quarterly cadence of revenue and margins. I totally appreciate that you guys don\u2019t historically do specific quarterly EPS guidance. But if you could talk a little bit about maybe the price cost impact, how things kind of look versus normal seasonality, just because 2022 seems like it could be a bit of a strange year again?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, you\u2019re right, I think it\u2019s likely to be another strange year. If you look at it historically, our first half versus second half in terms of the EPS that we generate for the full year, we are typically 49% in the first half and 51% in the second half. Yes 49% and 51% will be good. That\u2019s one way to do that. So we\u2019re 49 and 51, historically, we think this year based on current run rates, and how we think price cost might play out, we\u2019re more like a 47:53. So it\u2019s close. But the plans are a little more backend loaded than typical. The one thing I\u2019ll just call out is, if you look at Q1 specifically, in Q1 last year, there were no significant chip shortages in the automotive space. So that auto was up 8% last year in Q1. We still expect the auto business to be down here in the first quarter of 2022. Not as much as in Q4, but still a down quarter in automotive. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving this more backend loaded plan that I talked about. I think I just add on price cost we\u2019re going to continuing to work that our teams are doing a good job. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to catch up here even though we are the lag that we historically have seen has become smaller as we\u2019ve learned some things in the past and are doing a better job responding with timely and appropriate price adjustments as we deal with this really unprecedented raw material cost inflation. I might just add, we\u2019ve also not really seen anything to suggest that those inflationary pressures are slowing down.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it, that\u2019s very clear. And just a quick follow up on the price cost situation. Is the expectation that we kind of enter 2022 with a similar headwind to what you experienced in the fourth quarter and then you exit with a price cost tailwind?\nMichael Larsen: So I think the expectation is that price costs will be margin dilutive 50 basis points for the year. And that consistent with our past practice, and all of 2021, the goal was to be EPS neutral or better and I think slightly positive is where we ended up as we said in Q4. But to be honest with you, it\u2019s a really uncertain environment here. I mean, if there are further raw material cost increases we are going to read, we\u2019re going to react to those raw material cost increases with further price and that will put further pressure on the margins. So it\u2019s really difficult to predict what will end up for the year. In our guidance here in our model is 50 basis points of headwind.\nScott Santi: It\u2019s good to say that the net 50 basis points include all existing and known price increases. But I think just put up a bit of emphasis on your point. Subsequent increases that we don\u2019t know about today that occur then certainly affect that level of margin dilution as we go through the year.\nMichael Larsen: So yes, there\u2019s no assumption here that things are getting better or worse. This is based on what we\u2019re seeing in our businesses today, based on incurred known and future costs and corresponding price increases. And it\u2019ll be I think, again in 2022, as you said, a strange year, a pretty dynamic year from that perspective too.\nNicole DeBlase: Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Sprague: I wonder if you could just provide a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on at the customer level on supply chain and the nature of the questions, Scott, in particular gone back to Q2, but also in Q3 I think had some issues of just being able to deliver to customers, despite your own ability to deliver. Was that an impact in Q4 and do you see that sort of situation continuing into the early part of this year?\nScott Santi: The way I would respond to that is, I think those issues in terms of customer impacted demand, customer supply chain impacted demand are better known today. So in Q2 it was sort of emerging situation, it was volatile. I would say that the sort of order the shipment, the timing of all that has been adjusted around a more known set of issues that our customers. So it\u2019s less of us of a surprise, it\u2019s hard to say it had any incremental impact in Q4 because it was just basically embedded in our plan, by that point, in our run rates in our plan so I think overall thing that I would say is we\u2019re not seeing any evidence that things are improving in a dramatic fashion from the standpoint of all of the supply chain constraints. It\u2019s still there are issues all over the place. We are reacting to those internally very well. Our customers are still challenged the automotive is just the most visible representation of that, but that these sorts of issues are applying to all customers of ours across all seven of our segments. But it\u2019s still given the growth rates, the net-net of all of it is still very positive in terms of underlying demand. And if everybody had everything that access to every component, and every bit of raw materials that they might want right now, I couldn\u2019t even guess sort of the incremental delta on that, but it\u2019d be meaningful.\nJeffrey Sprague: Could you provide us some context on what your aggregate realized price was in 2021 and what\u2019s embedded in your guidance for 2022?\nScott Santi: So we provided kind of an estimate. And that\u2019s really what this is, at best is an estimate of the breakdown between price and volume for full year 2021. I think we said price of 3% to 4%, roughly for the full year and organic growth in that 8% range. So that\u2019s what we talked about in the last call that\u2019s where we ended up. And while I fully appreciate the question, I\u2019m not sure I can be really helpful in terms of the guidance here for 2022 because as I said, price versus volume and these are estimates at best. And so in our opinion, the performance metric that really matters most is organic growth, which of course, includes both price and volume. And we try to be very transparent in terms of providing fully organic growth guidance at the enterprise level for the segments. And we report actuals as we go through the year both for the enterprise and for the segments, but that\u2019s really as much granularity as we can give you with a high degree of confidence.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great, and maybe just one last one for me. I mean, the auto guide you gave is pretty clear builds plus your normal content. So there\u2019s no kind of bullwhip effect in the channel like we heard at 3am there was a lot of disconnect between build rates and what was in the channel and some real disconnects between the two. But it sounds like from your vantage point, and relative to your supply chain, everything is sort of evened out. Is that correct or there\u2019s maybe some noise first half versus second half?\nScott Santi: No I think that\u2019s a fair way to characterize it. And maybe just to be clear, if you look at kind of third party leading industry, I hesitate to call them experts, but forecasts at least are suggesting builds for the year 2022 somewhere in that 9% to 10% range. What we have embedded in our guidance here is basically half of that. So we are somewhere in the mid single digits as our base assumption for automotive bills. They are plus 2 to 3 percentage points of penetration gains, which are essentially locked in at this point. And so hopefully that\u2019s a fairly conservative assumption. It is also a little backend loaded. So I think like I said, we expect auto to be down at least in Q1 and then was gradual improvement from there as we go through the year and hopefully these supply chain issues get resolved and automotive like we said will become a really meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the company once those bottlenecks get resolved.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: I think a lot of the good questions have been asked but can you tell us again, when you were talking about divestitures in your commentary, I kind of zoned out for a second. Yes I don\u2019t know what was going on. But can you remind us kind of the periodicity and the size and timing of that? And then, I\u2019m just kind of curious, are there MTS type acquisitions out there that you have in your sights that could offset some of that?\nScott Santi: So just to kind of summarize on the divestitures real quick. So we\u2019ve begun the previously announced divestiture plans. We\u2019ve kind of reinitiate, the process for five business units here, with combined annual revenues of about $500 million and we expect the process could take anywhere between 12 to 18 months to get these completed. And of course, as you know, there\u2019s a fair bit of uncertainty around the timing of these. And so, in our guidance today is embedded that we\u2019re that we own these businesses for all 2022. And we\u2019ve also not included any kind of onetime gains on sale that might flow through. The positive impacts of the company, obviously, the onetime gains on sale is one thing, but really the kind of the structural benefit is approximately 50 basis points improvement in the overall organic growth rate of the company, and 50 basis points of improvement in the overall operating margin of the company. So that\u2019s kind of the addition by subtraction effect with the divestitures. And essentially, if you wanted to, you could say that we\u2019ve added a really high quality asset with MTS and we were replacing these divestitures with a business that we know can deliver the type of performance that we\u2019ve seen in our Instron business through the application of the business model. In terms of the pipeline of deals, I mean, I think we remain disciplined, but also opportunistic and to the extent that other opportunities come along that have the same characteristics that we\u2019ve talked about many times and we\u2019re going to certainly be leaning in on those and when that might, when these things might come to fruition that\u2019s always a little bit of there\u2019s some uncertainty around that, just like there\u2019s some uncertainty around the timing of these divestitures.\nScott Davis: Okay, thank you for that. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Indiscernible] on for Jamie. We were wondering if there\u2019s any way you could quantify the market share gains they\u2019ve been talking about and how sustainable they are? And then in terms of price cost, if you could give us any color on option for 1H versus 2H and if you\u2019re hedged at all? Thank you.\nScott Santi: So let me take a shot at this. I mean, I think on the market share gains, I mean, I think at the core of these when the recovery initiatives that we\u2019ve talked a lot about is the goal of accelerating our organic growth efforts and gaining significant market shares at a time when competitors in many cases were not able to stay invested in their people, in their new products, in their capacity expansion plans, not able to maintain service levels at the same level as ITW. And so we are hearing across the company, from many, many of our divisions, lots of anecdotal evidence that we are gaining market share. It\u2019s difficult to quantify. It\u2019s an estimate at best and it\u2019s not one that we\u2019re confident reporting on externally, but I think there\u2019s a lot of evidence inside the company that we are gaining share. I\u2019ll just point to our 12% organic revenue growth last year with the challenges in auto and then 6% to 9% organic this year and maybe when we get to a point where the market growth rates stabilized, maybe we\u2019ll be able to talk a little bit more about what our above market organic growth rates are. But we\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019re making good progress on our organic growth efforts. On your first half versus second half on price cost, I think we just talked about this. I mean, it remains a pretty uncertain environment. If things stay the way they are price cost will be a headwind in the first half and it\u2019ll be maybe neutral in the second half. And for the full year, we ended up somewhere around 50 basis points of margin dilution impact. And to answer your question, we do not hedge. So the costs that are flowing through our P&L today are essentially today\u2019s costs. And there\u2019s a whole host of reasons why we think that\u2019s a much better way of dealing with these costs real time maybe a little bit different than what you\u2019re seeing at other companies. But that\u2019s the quick answer on your hedging question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hello, everyone. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is your inventories saw a notable increase in the fourth quarter. How much is that is related to the MTS acquisition? And how should we think about its impact on margin and cost absorption as we look into the first quarter and the rest of the year?\nScott Santi: So I think, the inventory increase this year, which, like I said, that was a strategic decision to really secure supply for our customers and mitigate any risk around supply chain about 100, a little over $100 million came from MTS here in the month of December as we closed in the transaction. The specific impact from MTS on margins this year is 50 basis points. And I don\u2019t know if that was exactly your question or you had something else in mind.\nTami Zakaria: I think that that\u2019s helpful. I do have another follow up question on MTS actually. So when do you expect MTS to be margin accretive?\nScott Santi: Well, I would say we\u2019re not in a rush. We\u2019re going to be very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of how we implement the business model like we always do. I might just add, we\u2019re really excited about MTS because the business model never been more powerful than it is today. And so we\u2019re excited about what it can do. I think what we said was it\u2019ll take about five to seven years to get to ITW caliber, margins and organic growth rates that are in line with what we\u2019re seeing in the instrument business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [Indiscernible] on for Julian. So first question around, it seems like the 22 guide implies around 30% incremental. You guys have talked a lot to kind of the MTS impact and test and measurement and some price cost impact in the first half in auto. Is there anything else to call out the other segments regarding margin expansion costs throughout 22, could you help us?\nScott Santi: Well, I\u2019ll just say 30% incrementals that is including the impact from MTS, actually if you adjust for that incrementals for 2022 are in line with our historical kind of 35% to 40% range. And I think as you look across the segment, there\u2019s really nothing unusual going on in terms of margins I think consistent with kind of the bottoms up planning process that we do at ITW. Our segments have all told us that they expect to do a little bit better in 2022 than they did in 2021 despite the fact that they are all operating at best in class levels relative to the markets and the competitors in those markets. So nothing unusual, we expect. Like I said overall 100 basis points of margin improvement, which is what we typically do. The enterprise initiatives are, it\u2019s great to see I think in page 10 another strong contribution from 80:20 and strategic sourcing that\u2019s pretty broad based across all seven segments, so nothing unusual. We really expect based on what they\u2019ve told us continued progress certainly on organic growth, as you can see on page 10, in the slide deck and also on operating margins.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just maybe one more follow up on capital deployment and the portfolio definitely more active and kind of this year in guiding for next year. Should we assume, though, in terms of when we think about priorities, just given the buyback guide for 1.5 billion can you just talk about how you prioritize M&A versus share repurchases kind of over the next 12 months, probably 18 months?\nScott Santi: Well, I think we\u2019re really fortunate that we are in a position to do both. And so these are not mutually exclusive. I went through the four priorities, they are 1.5 billion, I mean, something really unusual would have to happen for us to not complete that program. It\u2019s really the allocation of our surplus capital. And there\u2019s plenty of room for more MTS type acquisitions to the extent that they become available.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nJoe O\u2019Dea: I wanted to start just on supply chain, I think it\u2019s been clear that it\u2019s not getting better, but I\u2019m curious about not getting worse. And so the degree to which over the past three or four months, your confidence level and some stabilization and how that allows you to operate a little bit better and then just in general if you do have any better visibility into when things start to improve a little bit I think some of the semiconductor comments and improve timing of shipments maybe but anything you could touch on visibility to improvement?\nScott Santi: I think from the standpoint of the tactical issues now, I would certainly say that the environment is pretty stable but that just means that we\u2019ve gotten used to this environment, that there is, there are new issues popping up everywhere. I think, from the standpoint of the tactics that we\u2019ve our businesses employed to continue to serve our customers at a high level in this environment. We have certainly learned some things. Michael talked about our willingness to use our balance sheet to support inventory and investments. We have talked about the fact that our localized supply chains have really come up big for us here. Our long term relationships with our key suppliers all of those things it certainly helped us operate in this environment. We\u2019ve got in, I\u2019m not going to say comfortable, but we\u2019ve gotten used to operating in this environment. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sort of the set of issues that we\u2019re confronting on a daily and weekly basis are shrinking dramatically at this point. In terms of forward visibility I think our mode is not the guess and not the look ahead, I think we are I react company. We are well positioned to do that. You can read the same sort of industry level stuff that we read. And it\u2019s interesting, but until it actually shows up, we\u2019re not counting on it. And we\u2019ll continue to read and react to the conditions on the ground as we always do. That being said, it obviously at some point is going to start to improve in a material way. And at that point things certainly get easier. We get the turn even more of our attention to leveraging the strong market positions into consistent above market growth.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: That\u2019s helpful. And then just a second one, when you talk about kind of the focus on when the recovery, I imagine that none of those folks who have lost share are all that happy about it. And at some point your focus becomes kind of sustained the victory. But what are the tools that you have in place? What\u2019s your confidence level that the share gains through these disruptions are sticky game?\nScott Santi: Well, our focus in these games is really with our biggest and best customers that were our biggest and best customers before the pandemic. And I think in all of these cases what this pandemic provides us and this is true across the portfolio is an opportunity to demonstrate how ITW is different that we were there for our customers in a time of significant stress and challenges. And I think there is we are not looking for opportunistic sort of transient opportunities in this. We are looking for opportunities where we can truly leverage what is an advantage position and an advantage operating model in ways that ultimately proved to our biggest and best customers as I said, what the ITW difference is. And I expect that our ability to perform the way that we have and there\u2019s as Michael said, there\u2019s plenty of sort of anecdotal evidence of this. We are winning business today because of our ability to supply and not just supply, but supply these little items of high quality products. So I think as we said at the outset, this is a real opportunity for ITW to demonstrate some pretty fundamental core differences in our capabilities in the markets that we serve and in our people, in our business model, in my view, have absolutely stepped up to the challenge.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: And just to confirm my understanding correctly, the bigger portion of kind of the share wins would be better penetration at existing customers not so much about new customers?\nScott Santi: Yes. That\u2019s the first priority in this environment, absolutely, taking care of our existing key customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. \nMig Dobre: Thank you for taking the question. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to the discussion on pricing. And I certainly appreciate that there has been quite a bit of pricing that you had to put through in 21 and it looks like 22 is not going to be much different. I\u2019m curious your view as to what happens when raw material inflationary pressures abate? How are your contracts structured or your conversations with your customers? Do you think these pricing increases actually stick and are there any differences various segments, one versus the other?\nScott Santi: Well, I think given the differentiated nature of our product and service offerings across the company, I think, first of all, we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019ve been able to make the appropriate price adjustments to offset these really unprecedented raw material cost increases. And I think if and when those costs start to stabilize or come back down I mean, there\u2019s certainly going to be individual discussions with customers, but we don\u2019t expect that we\u2019ll have to adjust pricing in a meaningful way, certainly not in a way that you\u2019ll see in the financials that we report. \nMig Dobre: And then, my follow up is more of an operating question. You haven\u2019t really talked much about the Omicron spike and what that might have done to your own internal operations. I\u2019m presuming there was some absenteeism in various manufacturing sites related to this. And I guess my question is this, now that we\u2019re maybe two years into this pandemic how have you changed the way you do business internally and the way you operate from a just pure output and resilience standpoint? With the question really being if we are seeing yet another wave, say, for instance, in three, four months how are you prepared to handle that relative to, frankly, what you\u2019ve had to go through over the past couple years? Thank you.\nScott Santi: Well, all I could do is point to our, the way we\u2019ve executed through the various waves to this point. I think there is have we had to adjust to the challenges of the pandemic from a people a safety standpoint, let alone a production standpoint, absolutely. That\u2019s been going on now for coming up on two years. So I don\u2019t, I think the way the company has responded we talked a lot about resilience, and that\u2019s certainly part of it. But we are a manufacturer. We\u2019ve got to have in our people are key to our ability to execute. And so we have done everything we need, everything within our power to keep our people safe, to keep our production lines running to be able to serve our customers. Have we learned things in the process? Of course, like a lot of companies have. This is not a normal environment as you all know, but ultimately I\u2019m very comfortable that we are negotiating our way through these challenges in a really strong manner and will continue to do so. We\u2019ll deal with whatever comes our way.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: I wasn\u2019t on the call, I apologize if I\u2019m going over stuff that you\u2019ve already covered. But I\u2019m just curious, really in terms of, this is a very little of a question, but corporate expense number came in a little bit heavier than what we had modeled. And I know that you\u2019ve been pushing more centralized costs over the last couple years. Just wondering what drove that and what we should be assume for 2022?\nScott Santi: So, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about the unallocated number that\u2019s a little bit higher in Q4 at $56 million, I think Q3 was $43 million and the difference is the MTS transaction costs. So kind of a onetime and I think for modeling purposes for next year, I would assume somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million range.\nNigel Coe: Okay, so the one time production costs coming through there okay, that that\u2019s very clear. And then again, sorry, if you\u2019ve got this for the free cash conversion like 100%, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s working capital investments as you recover, but anything else that would be helpful? \nScott Santi: No, it\u2019s just the investment in inventory. I mean, I think, obviously higher receivables with higher 15% revenue growth, and then the inventory to support our customers in a challenging supply chain environment. So we think that\u2019s a pretty smart use of our balance sheet. So that\u2019s what.\nOperator: There are no further questions. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. The strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 5.9% year-over-year to $3.7 billion with organic growth of 5.3%. The MTS acquisition added 1.3% and foreign currency translation impact reduced revenue by 0.7%. Sequentially, organic revenue accelerated by 6% from Q3 into Q4 on our sales per day basis, as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%. By geography, North America grew 9% and international was up 1%. Europe declined 2% while Asia-Pacific was up 7% with China up 2%. GAAP EPS of $1.93 included $0.02 of headwind from the MTS acquisition and related transaction costs. Operating margin was 22.7% to 23.1% excluding MTS. As expected in the fourth quarter, we experienced price cost margin headwinds of 200 basis points, the same as in the third quarter. Our businesses continued to respond appropriately and decisively to rising raw material costs and in the fourth quarter and the full year, we were positive on dollar for dollar basis. Overall for Q4 excellent operational execution across the board and strong financial performance in what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment. Okay, let's go to slide 4 for segment results starting with automotive OEM. As expected organic revenue was down 16% with North America down 12%, Europe down 29% and China down 3%. Despite these near term pressures on the top line, operating margin was resilient and remained solidly in the mid teens. While supply chain challenges continue to persist for the industry in the near term, we are confident that the inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major contributor to organic growth for ITW over an extended period of time as these issues ultimately get resolved. Food equipment led the way this quarter with the highest organic growth rate inside the company at 21%. North America was up 22% with equipment up 26% and service up 15%. Institutional growth of 28% was particularly strong education and restaurants were up around 50%. International growth was strong and on par with North America at 20% mostly driven by Europe up 23% with Asia-Pacific up 9%. Both equipment and service grew 20%. Turning to slide 5 for test and measurement and electronics. Organic growth was 11% with electronics up 4% and test and measurement up 17% driven by continued strong demand for semiconductors and capital equipment as evidenced by organic growth rate of 17% in our Instron business. Scott said in December, we closed on the MTS acquisition which we're excited about as it's a great strategic fit for ITW and highly complementary to our Instron business. We acquired the Instron in 2006 and today it is a business growing consistently at 6% to 7% organically with operating margins well above the company average. We're confident that MTS has the potential to reach similar levels of performance over the next five to seven years through the application of the ITW business model. Moving to slide 6. Welding delivered broad based organic revenue growth of 15% with 30% operating margin in Q4. Equipment revenue grew 14% and consumables were up 16%. Industrial revenue grew 18% and the commercial business grew 8%. North America was up 15% and International growth was 14% driven by 18% growth in oil and gas. Polymers and fluids organic growth was 3% with 8% growth in polymers with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Fluids was down 5% against the tough comp of plus 16% last year when demand for industrial hygiene products surged. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with continued strength in retail. Onto slide 7. Construction organic revenue was up 12% as North America grew 22% with residential renovation up 23% driven by continued strength in the home center channel. Commercial construction which is about 20% of our business was up 21%. Europe grew 2% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%. Specialty organic growth was strong at 7% with North America up 10% and International up 2%. With that let's go to slide 8 for a summary of 2021. Operationally, the teams around the world continue to execute with discipline in a challenging environment as they sustained world class customer service levels, implemented timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs and executed on our win the recovery initiatives to accelerate organic growth across the portfolio. As a result, revenue grew 15% to $14.5 billion with broad based organic growth of 12%, 14% if you exclude auto OEM where growth was obviously very constrained due to two component shortages at our customers. Operating income increased 21% and operating margin was 24.1%. Incremental margin was 32%, which is below our typical 35% to 40% range due to price costs. Excluding the impact of price cost, incremental margin was 40%. GAAP EPS increased 28% and after tax ROIC improved by more than 300 basis points to 29.5%. Free cash flow was $2.3 billion with a conversion rate of 84% of net income, which is below our 100% plus long term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company's 15% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. Moving to slide 9 for our full year 2022 guidance. So, we're heading into 2022 with strong momentum and the company is in a very good position to deliver another year of strong financial performance with organic growth of 6% to 9% and 10% to 15% earnings growth. For our usual process, our organic growth guidance is established by projecting current levels of demand into the future and adjusting them for typical seasonality. As you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in 2022 with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level. Our total revenue growth projection of 7.5% to 10.5% includes a 3% contribution from MTS partially offset by 1.5% of foreign currency headwind at today's exchange rates. Specific to MTS, guidance includes full year revenue of $400 million to $450 million. The expectation that margins are dilutive at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and finally, consistent with what we've said before EPS neutral. Operating margin excluding MTS is forecast to expand by about 100 basis points to 24.5% to 25.5% as enterprise initiatives contribute approximately 100 basis points. We expect price cost headwind of about 50 basis points. Incremental margin is expected to be about 30%, including MTS and our core incremental margin excluding MTS is in our typical 35% to 40% range. We expect GAAP EPS in the range of $8.90 to $9.30 which is up 10% to 15% excluding onetime tax items from last year. The tax rate for 2022 is expected to be 23% to 24% as compared to 19% in 2021. We are forecasting solid free cash flow with a conversion rate of 90% to 100% of net income with further working capital investments to support the company's growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers as needed. Our capital allocation plans for 2022 are consistent with our longstanding disciplined capital allocation framework. Priority number one remains internal investments to support our organic growth efforts and sustain our highly profitable core businesses. Second, an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high quality acquisitions such as MTS that enhance ITW's long term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement potential from the application of our proprietary 80:20 front to back methodology and can generate acceptable risk adjusted returns on our shareholders capital. Lastly, we allocate surplus capital to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buyback $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2022. In addition, we have reactivated our previously announced divestiture plans and in 2022, we will reinitiate divestiture processes for five businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $500 million. While these businesses are performing quite well, coming out of the pandemic, they operate in markets where growth expectations are not aligned with ITW's long term organic growth goals. When these divestitures are completed over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect approximately 50 basis points of lift to ITW's organic growth rate and operating margins. Given the timing uncertainties associated with these divestiture transactions, 2022 guidance assumes we own them for the full year. Finally, last slide is Slide 10 with the organic growth projections by segment. You can see that based on current run rates we're expecting some solid organic growth rates in every one of our seven segments with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level. For automotive OEM, our guidance of 6% to 10% is based on a risk adjusted forecast of automotive production in the mid single digits plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%. With that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Yes, I think polymers and fluids is really the growth rate for 2022 is established the same way as the other segments, which is based on current levels of demand inside of the segment today projected into 2022 and adjusted for typical seasonality. So that's where you get to that 5% to 9% range for polymers and fluids. On the CapEx question I'd say, we definitely continue to see very strong demand in our capital equipment businesses. We talked about an acceleration from Q3 into Q4 with revenue per day of 6%, when normally we're only up 2% and we expect really that strong demand to continue into 2022. Again, we're not assuming an acceleration in 2022. It's based on current run rates but based on the trends we're seeing, it's possible that we fully expect that demand will continue at these levels. We've seen nothing in Q4 to suggest that demand is slowing down in any one of our segments. Well, I think on auto margins, they've been remarkably resilient, considering that we've been down 15% to 20% in Q3 and Q4 and we're still in that mid to high teen level. Obviously, as auto production comes back, we're going to get positive volume leverage in the business. Price cost remains a significant headwind and it's not so much steel is really more on the resin side in the auto business and we expect that those headwinds will continue in 2022 in the auto business. As we've talked about before getting priced takes a little bit longer in the in this space, just given the contractual nature of the industry. And we are continuing to partner with our customers as we renew contracts and add new content to vehicles and so I do think that longer term structurally auto margins will go back to levels that we're at historically which is in the low to mid 20s. When exactly that happens really depends on when volume comes back and when we get ahead of these price cost headwinds that are pretty significant at this point. Yes, you're right, I think it's likely to be another strange year. If you look at it historically, our first half versus second half in terms of the EPS that we generate for the full year, we are typically 49% in the first half and 51% in the second half. Yes 49% and 51% will be good. That's one way to do that. So we're 49 and 51, historically, we think this year based on current run rates, and how we think price cost might play out, we're more like a 47:53. So it's close. But the plans are a little more backend loaded than typical. The one thing I'll just call out is, if you look at Q1 specifically, in Q1 last year, there were no significant chip shortages in the automotive space. So that auto was up 8% last year in Q1. We still expect the auto business to be down here in the first quarter of 2022. Not as much as in Q4, but still a down quarter in automotive. And so that's really what's driving this more backend loaded plan that I talked about. I think I just add on price cost we're going to continuing to work that our teams are doing a good job. It's going to take a little bit of time to catch up here even though we are the lag that we historically have seen has become smaller as we've learned some things in the past and are doing a better job responding with timely and appropriate price adjustments as we deal with this really unprecedented raw material cost inflation. I might just add, we've also not really seen anything to suggest that those inflationary pressures are slowing down. So I think the expectation is that price costs will be margin dilutive 50 basis points for the year. And that consistent with our past practice, and all of 2021, the goal was to be EPS neutral or better and I think slightly positive is where we ended up as we said in Q4. But to be honest with you, it's a really uncertain environment here. I mean, if there are further raw material cost increases we are going to read, we're going to react to those raw material cost increases with further price and that will put further pressure on the margins. So it's really difficult to predict what will end up for the year. In our guidance here in our model is 50 basis points of headwind. So yes, there's no assumption here that things are getting better or worse. This is based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, based on incurred known and future costs and corresponding price increases. And it'll be I think, again in 2022, as you said, a strange year, a pretty dynamic year from that perspective too."

            "content": "Thanks Karen and good morning, everyone. In Q4 ITW team delivered another quarter of excellent operational execution and strong financial performance. Six of our seven segments combined and delivered 12% organic growth while our auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near term limitations on auto productions due to component supply shortages and as a result was down 16% in the quarter. At the enterprise level we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP EPS of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7% and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income. Throughout the entirety of 2021, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering to our customers while responding quickly indecisively to rapidly rising input cost and aggressively executing our win the recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. As a result for the full year, we generated organic growth of 12% with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from 6% to 18% and despite a seemingly constant rise of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1% with another 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. GAAP EPS was an all time record at $8.51, an increase of 28% versus the prior year. And in 2021, we also raised our dividend by 7%, returned $2.5 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and closed on a very high quality acquisition in the MTS test and stimulation business. Most importantly we delivered these results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on our path to ITW's full potential through the execution of our long term enterprise strategy. As you may recall, early in the pandemic we made the decisions to remain fully invested in our people and in our long term strategy. The people that we retained in the marketing innovation and capacity investments that we continue to fund as a result of that decision are fueling the results that ITW is delivering today and have the company very well-positioned to continue to accelerate organic growth, add high quality bolt on acquisitions and sustain our best in class margins and returns in 2022 and beyond. I want to close by thanking all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication. Their performance throughout 2021 provides another proof point that ITW is a company that has the enduring competitive advantages, the agility and the resilience necessary to deliver top tier performance in any environment. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on our Q4 and full year 2021 performance as well as our 2022 guidance. Michael? It's good to say that the net 50 basis points include all existing and known price increases. But I think just put up a bit of emphasis on your point. Subsequent increases that we don't know about today that occur then certainly affect that level of margin dilution as we go through the year. The way I would respond to that is, I think those issues in terms of customer impacted demand, customer supply chain impacted demand are better known today. So in Q2 it was sort of emerging situation, it was volatile. I would say that the sort of order the shipment, the timing of all that has been adjusted around a more known set of issues that our customers. So it's less of us of a surprise, it's hard to say it had any incremental impact in Q4 because it was just basically embedded in our plan, by that point, in our run rates in our plan so I think overall thing that I would say is we're not seeing any evidence that things are improving in a dramatic fashion from the standpoint of all of the supply chain constraints. It's still there are issues all over the place. We are reacting to those internally very well. Our customers are still challenged the automotive is just the most visible representation of that, but that these sorts of issues are applying to all customers of ours across all seven of our segments. But it's still given the growth rates, the net-net of all of it is still very positive in terms of underlying demand. And if everybody had everything that access to every component, and every bit of raw materials that they might want right now, I couldn't even guess sort of the incremental delta on that, but it'd be meaningful. So we provided kind of an estimate. And that's really what this is, at best is an estimate of the breakdown between price and volume for full year 2021. I think we said price of 3% to 4%, roughly for the full year and organic growth in that 8% range. So that's what we talked about in the last call that's where we ended up. And while I fully appreciate the question, I'm not sure I can be really helpful in terms of the guidance here for 2022 because as I said, price versus volume and these are estimates at best. And so in our opinion, the performance metric that really matters most is organic growth, which of course, includes both price and volume. And we try to be very transparent in terms of providing fully organic growth guidance at the enterprise level for the segments. And we report actuals as we go through the year both for the enterprise and for the segments, but that's really as much granularity as we can give you with a high degree of confidence. No I think that's a fair way to characterize it. And maybe just to be clear, if you look at kind of third party leading industry, I hesitate to call them experts, but forecasts at least are suggesting builds for the year 2022 somewhere in that 9% to 10% range. What we have embedded in our guidance here is basically half of that. So we are somewhere in the mid single digits as our base assumption for automotive bills. They are plus 2 to 3 percentage points of penetration gains, which are essentially locked in at this point. And so hopefully that's a fairly conservative assumption. It is also a little backend loaded. So I think like I said, we expect auto to be down at least in Q1 and then was gradual improvement from there as we go through the year and hopefully these supply chain issues get resolved and automotive like we said will become a really meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the company once those bottlenecks get resolved. So just to kind of summarize on the divestitures real quick. So we've begun the previously announced divestiture plans. We've kind of reinitiate, the process for five business units here, with combined annual revenues of about $500 million and we expect the process could take anywhere between 12 to 18 months to get these completed. And of course, as you know, there's a fair bit of uncertainty around the timing of these. And so, in our guidance today is embedded that we're that we own these businesses for all 2022. And we've also not included any kind of onetime gains on sale that might flow through. The positive impacts of the company, obviously, the onetime gains on sale is one thing, but really the kind of the structural benefit is approximately 50 basis points improvement in the overall organic growth rate of the company, and 50 basis points of improvement in the overall operating margin of the company. So that's kind of the addition by subtraction effect with the divestitures. And essentially, if you wanted to, you could say that we've added a really high quality asset with MTS and we were replacing these divestitures with a business that we know can deliver the type of performance that we've seen in our Instron business through the application of the business model. In terms of the pipeline of deals, I mean, I think we remain disciplined, but also opportunistic and to the extent that other opportunities come along that have the same characteristics that we've talked about many times and we're going to certainly be leaning in on those and when that might, when these things might come to fruition that's always a little bit of there's some uncertainty around that, just like there's some uncertainty around the timing of these divestitures. So let me take a shot at this. I mean, I think on the market share gains, I mean, I think at the core of these when the recovery initiatives that we've talked a lot about is the goal of accelerating our organic growth efforts and gaining significant market shares at a time when competitors in many cases were not able to stay invested in their people, in their new products, in their capacity expansion plans, not able to maintain service levels at the same level as ITW. And so we are hearing across the company, from many, many of our divisions, lots of anecdotal evidence that we are gaining market share. It's difficult to quantify. It's an estimate at best and it's not one that we're confident reporting on externally, but I think there's a lot of evidence inside the company that we are gaining share. I'll just point to our 12% organic revenue growth last year with the challenges in auto and then 6% to 9% organic this year and maybe when we get to a point where the market growth rates stabilized, maybe we'll be able to talk a little bit more about what our above market organic growth rates are. But we're highly confident that we're making good progress on our organic growth efforts. On your first half versus second half on price cost, I think we just talked about this. I mean, it remains a pretty uncertain environment. If things stay the way they are price cost will be a headwind in the first half and it'll be maybe neutral in the second half. And for the full year, we ended up somewhere around 50 basis points of margin dilution impact. And to answer your question, we do not hedge. So the costs that are flowing through our P&L today are essentially today's costs. And there's a whole host of reasons why we think that's a much better way of dealing with these costs real time maybe a little bit different than what you're seeing at other companies. But that's the quick answer on your hedging question. So I think, the inventory increase this year, which, like I said, that was a strategic decision to really secure supply for our customers and mitigate any risk around supply chain about 100, a little over $100 million came from MTS here in the month of December as we closed in the transaction. The specific impact from MTS on margins this year is 50 basis points. And I don't know if that was exactly your question or you had something else in mind. Well, I would say we're not in a rush. We're going to be very deliberate and thoughtful in terms of how we implement the business model like we always do. I might just add, we're really excited about MTS because the business model never been more powerful than it is today. And so we're excited about what it can do. I think what we said was it'll take about five to seven years to get to ITW caliber, margins and organic growth rates that are in line with what we're seeing in the instrument business. Well, I'll just say 30% incrementals that is including the impact from MTS, actually if you adjust for that incrementals for 2022 are in line with our historical kind of 35% to 40% range. And I think as you look across the segment, there's really nothing unusual going on in terms of margins I think consistent with kind of the bottoms up planning process that we do at ITW. Our segments have all told us that they expect to do a little bit better in 2022 than they did in 2021 despite the fact that they are all operating at best in class levels relative to the markets and the competitors in those markets. So nothing unusual, we expect. Like I said overall 100 basis points of margin improvement, which is what we typically do. The enterprise initiatives are, it's great to see I think in page 10 another strong contribution from 80:20 and strategic sourcing that's pretty broad based across all seven segments, so nothing unusual. We really expect based on what they've told us continued progress certainly on organic growth, as you can see on page 10, in the slide deck and also on operating margins. Well, I think we're really fortunate that we are in a position to do both. And so these are not mutually exclusive. I went through the four priorities, they are 1.5 billion, I mean, something really unusual would have to happen for us to not complete that program. It's really the allocation of our surplus capital. And there's plenty of room for more MTS type acquisitions to the extent that they become available. I think from the standpoint of the tactical issues now, I would certainly say that the environment is pretty stable but that just means that we've gotten used to this environment, that there is, there are new issues popping up everywhere. I think, from the standpoint of the tactics that we've our businesses employed to continue to serve our customers at a high level in this environment. We have certainly learned some things. Michael talked about our willingness to use our balance sheet to support inventory and investments. We have talked about the fact that our localized supply chains have really come up big for us here. Our long term relationships with our key suppliers all of those things it certainly helped us operate in this environment. We've got in, I'm not going to say comfortable, but we've gotten used to operating in this environment. But I don't think there's any sort of the set of issues that we're confronting on a daily and weekly basis are shrinking dramatically at this point. In terms of forward visibility I think our mode is not the guess and not the look ahead, I think we are I react company. We are well positioned to do that. You can read the same sort of industry level stuff that we read. And it's interesting, but until it actually shows up, we're not counting on it. And we'll continue to read and react to the conditions on the ground as we always do. That being said, it obviously at some point is going to start to improve in a material way. And at that point things certainly get easier. We get the turn even more of our attention to leveraging the strong market positions into consistent above market growth. Well, our focus in these games is really with our biggest and best customers that were our biggest and best customers before the pandemic. And I think in all of these cases what this pandemic provides us and this is true across the portfolio is an opportunity to demonstrate how ITW is different that we were there for our customers in a time of significant stress and challenges. And I think there is we are not looking for opportunistic sort of transient opportunities in this. We are looking for opportunities where we can truly leverage what is an advantage position and an advantage operating model in ways that ultimately proved to our biggest and best customers as I said, what the ITW difference is. And I expect that our ability to perform the way that we have and there's as Michael said, there's plenty of sort of anecdotal evidence of this. We are winning business today because of our ability to supply and not just supply, but supply these little items of high quality products. So I think as we said at the outset, this is a real opportunity for ITW to demonstrate some pretty fundamental core differences in our capabilities in the markets that we serve and in our people, in our business model, in my view, have absolutely stepped up to the challenge. Yes. That's the first priority in this environment, absolutely, taking care of our existing key customers. Well, I think given the differentiated nature of our product and service offerings across the company, I think, first of all, we're very pleased that we've been able to make the appropriate price adjustments to offset these really unprecedented raw material cost increases. And I think if and when those costs start to stabilize or come back down I mean, there's certainly going to be individual discussions with customers, but we don't expect that we'll have to adjust pricing in a meaningful way, certainly not in a way that you'll see in the financials that we report. Well, all I could do is point to our, the way we've executed through the various waves to this point. I think there is have we had to adjust to the challenges of the pandemic from a people a safety standpoint, let alone a production standpoint, absolutely. That's been going on now for coming up on two years. So I don't, I think the way the company has responded we talked a lot about resilience, and that's certainly part of it. But we are a manufacturer. We've got to have in our people are key to our ability to execute. And so we have done everything we need, everything within our power to keep our people safe, to keep our production lines running to be able to serve our customers. Have we learned things in the process? Of course, like a lot of companies have. This is not a normal environment as you all know, but ultimately I'm very comfortable that we are negotiating our way through these challenges in a really strong manner and will continue to do so. We'll deal with whatever comes our way. So, I'm assuming you're talking about the unallocated number that's a little bit higher in Q4 at $56 million, I think Q3 was $43 million and the difference is the MTS transaction costs. So kind of a onetime and I think for modeling purposes for next year, I would assume somewhere in that $30 million to $40 million range. No, it's just the investment in inventory. I mean, I think, obviously higher receivables with higher 15% revenue growth, and then the inventory to support our customers in a challenging supply chain environment. So we think that's a pretty smart use of our balance sheet. So that's what."

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Tammy. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2021. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we saw continued strong growth momentum in 6 of our 7 segments and delivered excellent operational execution and financial results. Revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 6% and earnings per share of $2.02 was up 10%. At the segment level, organic growth was led by welding at plus 22%; food equipment at plus 19%; Test & Measurement and Electronics at plus 12% and specialty products at plus 8%. Our automotive OE segment continued to be impacted in the near term by auto production cutbacks associated with the well-publicized supply chain challenges affecting our auto customers. In Q3, auto production cutbacks ended up being significantly larger than what was projected heading into the quarter. And as a result, our auto OEM segment revenues were down 11% in Q3 versus the minus 2% we were expecting as of the end of June. In a very challenging environment, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of executing for our customers and for the company. In Q3, our people leveraged the combination of ITW's robust and highly flexible 80/20 front-to-back operating system. The company is close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain capabilities and systems and our decision to stay fully staffed and invested through the pandemic to sustain world-class service levels for our customers. They also executed appropriate and timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs. And as a result, we were able to fully offset input cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in Q3, resulting in 0 EPS impact from price cost in the quarter. And, by the way, our teams also managed to continue to drive progress on our long-term strategy, execute on our Win the Recovery positioning initiative and deliver another 100 basis points of margin improvement benefit from enterprise initiatives. Moving forward, we remain very focused on sustaining our growth momentum and on fully leveraging the competitive strength of the ITW business model and the investments we have made and continue to make in support of the execution of our enterprise strategy. Before turning it over to Michael, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for all their efforts and for their dedication to keeping themselves and their ITW colleagues safe to serving our customers with excellence and to driving continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. Michael, over to you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As Scott said, demand remained strong in Q3 with total revenue of $3.6 billion an increase of 8% with organic growth of 6%. Growth was positive in 6 or 7 segments, ranging from 3% to 22% and in all geographic regions, led by North America, up 9%; Europe, up 1% and; Asia, up 5%. China was up 2% versus prior year and up 6% sequentially. GAAP EPS of $2.02 was up 10% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.06. Operating income increased 7% and operating margin was flat at 23.8% despite significant price cost headwinds. Enterprise Initiatives were real positive again this quarter at 100 basis points, as was volume leverage, which contributed more than 100 basis points. Thanks to a great effort by our businesses, price cost was EPS-neutral in Q3 but still dilutive to operating margin percentage by 200 basis points as raw material cost increases further escalated in the third quarter. Throughout 2021, our businesses have quickly and decisively responded to raw material and logistics cost inflation with pricing actions in alignment with our policy to fully offset these cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we've talked about this before, but given the current environment, I'll remind you that we don't hedge. So current cost inflation is always moving through our businesses in real time. After-tax return on invested capital was 28.5% and free cash flow was $548 million. Free cash flow conversion was 86% as our businesses have been very intentional about adding inventory to both support our growth and to mitigate supply chain risk and sustained world-class service levels for our customers. Overall, for the quarter, then strong growth in 6 of 7 segments and excellent operational and financial execution across the board. Let's go to Slide 4 for segment results. And before we get to the segment detail, the data on the left side of the slide illustrates our strong Q3 results with and without automotive OEM. I wanted to highlight 2 key points. The first is the benefit we derive from our high-quality diversified business portfolio in terms of the strength, resilience and consistency of ITW's financial performance. which is enabling us, in this case, to power through significant near-term headwinds in our largest segment and still deliver top-tier overall performance. The second is the accelerating growth momentum with strong core earnings leverage we're generating across the company. Excluding our auto OEM segment, given the issues affecting that market right now, the rest of the company collectively delivered organic growth of 11%. Operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 25% plus in Q3. As you can see on this slide, if you eliminate the price/cost impact, our core incrementals were a very strong 52% in the third quarter, which points to the quality of growth and profitability leverage that define the core focus of our business model and strategy. Now let's take a closer look at our segment performance in Q3, beginning with automotive OEM on the right side of this page. Organic revenue was down 11%, with North America down 12%, Europe, down 18%; and China, up 2%. And as Scott mentioned, supply chain-related production cutbacks were much larger in Q3 than what we and most, if not all, external auto industry forecasters were expecting heading into the quarter. While conditions in the auto market are obviously very challenging in the near term, but really good news from our standpoint is that the eventual and inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major source of growth for ITW over an extended period of time once the current supply chain issues begin to improve and ultimately get resolved. Between now and whenever that is, we will remain fully invested and strongly positioned to support our customers and seize incremental share gain opportunities as production accelerates coming out the other side of this situation. Turning to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, and organic revenue growth was very strong at 19% and the Food Equipment recovery that began in Q2 continues to gain strength. North America was up 18% with equipment up 20% and service up 14%. Institutional revenue, which is about 1/3 of our revenue, increased more than 20%, with strength in education, up over 40% and health care and lodging growth of around 20%. Restaurants were up almost 50% with strength across the board. Strong demand is evident internationally as well with Europe up 20% and Asia Pacific, up 23%. Equipment sales led the way up 26% with service growth of 8%. In our view, this segment is in the early stages of recovery as evidenced by revenues that are still below pre-COVID levels. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was strong with growth of 12%. Test & Measurement was up 15%, driven by continued strength in customer CapEx spend and in our businesses that serve the semiconductor space. Electronics grew 8% and operating margin was 26.8%. So moving to Slide 6. Welding demand continued to be very strong with organic revenue growth of 22%. Equipment revenue was up 25% and consumables grew 18%. Our industrial businesses increased 32% in the commercial business, which sells to small businesses and individual users grew 18%. North America was up 24% and international growth was 12% with continued recovery in oil and gas, which was up 9%. Welding had an operating margin of 30% in the quarter. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 3%, with demand holding steady at the elevated levels that began in Q3 of last year. And as such, had a tough comp of plus 6% a year ago. In Q3, growth was led by the Polymers business, up 8% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with sustained strength in the retail channel. And Fluids was down 5% due mostly to a decline in pandemic-related hygiene products versus prior year. Margins were 24.2% with more than 250 basis points of negative margin impact from price cost driven by significantly higher costs for resins and silicone. Moving to Slide 7. And a similar situation with construction, where organic growth was also up 3% and also on top of a strong year-ago growth rate of plus 8%. All 3 regions delivered growth with North America up 2%, with residential renovation up 1%, on top of a plus 14% comp a year ago and commercial was up 10%. Europe was up 8% and Australia and New Zealand was up 2%. Specialty organic revenue was up 8%, driven by continued recovery in North America, which was up 15%, and international was down 4%. Equipment sales were up 10% with consumables up almost 8%. Let's move on to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. As you saw in the press release, we're updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $8.30 to $8.50 which incorporates the impact of actual and anticipated lower automotive customer production levels in Q3 and Q4 versus our previous guidance on July 30. We now expect the Automotive OEM segment revenue to be down about 15% in the second half, including being down 20% in Q4 versus the forecast of roughly flat second half auto OEM revenues that was embedded in our previous guidance. All other segments remain on track or better versus our previous guidance. Our $8.40 midpoint equates to earnings growth of 27% for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion, which is up 13% at the midpoint, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Of that organic growth rate of 11% to 12% volume growth, including share gains are 8% with price of 3% to 4%. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 24%, which is up 100 basis points versus last year. And the fact that we're expanding margins at all in this environment is pretty strong performance, considering that we now expect raw material costs to be up 9% or more than $400 million year-over-year, which is more than 4x our expectation coming into this year. Our businesses are on track to offset raw material cost increases with pricing actions on a dollar-per-dollar basis, which, as you know, is EPS neutral but margin dilutive. As raw material costs and consequently, price have gone up more than what we predicted in our previous guidance, we now estimate margin dilution percentage impact from price cost for the full year at about 150 basis points versus our previous expectation of 100 basis points. These margin headwinds though, will be offset by strong volume leverage of about 250 basis points and another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives of more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of net income as we continue to prioritize sustaining our world-class service levels for our customers in this challenging environment, and as such, we will continue to invest in additional working capital to support our growth and mitigate supply chain risks. Our updated guidance is based on an expected tax rate for Q4 of 23% to 24% for a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. And as per usual process, our guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test and Simulation business. We are awaiting one final regulatory approval and expect to receive that and close the transaction in Q4. So in summary, this will be a record year for ITW with double-digit organic growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow and EPS growth of 25% plus. We expect this strong demand momentum to continue in Q4 and well into next year with an additional boost from automotive OEM likely at some point in 2022 as the supply chain issues there begin to improve. ITW remains very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Michael. Operator, can you please open up the lines for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: And maybe just on - so to start. Could you speak to what, if any, kind of maybe whipsaw effect that's going on as it relates to inventories. Just really trying to think about kind of how and when your sales might fully recouple with production? Or do you feel like they are fully coupled at this point? So any kind of nuances there to be aware of as we try to get out of this point.\nScott Santi: Yes. I don't know a whole lot of nuances. I know that our customers expect us to be able to - as we've talked many times before, we work today, we ship tomorrow. In the auto space, we are certainly giving quarterly guides from our customers in terms of their production forecast. And obviously, those have been more volatile than normal of late. But I would say that we're not - there may be a little bit of inventory cushioning going on if you look at sort of build rates relative to our sales I think our sales were actually higher than production declines in Q3 by sort of an incremental margin about 3 percentage points. I don't know the exact number. But - so there may be a little bit of cushion building there just given the overall environment. But I would say once this thing starts to turn around, that we should see a pretty immediate effect.\nJeffrey Sprague: And Scott, would you speak also just to the activity of your M&A pipeline. It looks like we're close to getting MTS done. Are you working an active pipeline at this point?\nScott Santi: We've talked about this many times before. We are a very interesting opportunity to require. We get things run by us all the time. We have a very clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy and our financial criteria. And so there are things that are continuously being evaluated. But it's just a matter of the right opportunity presenting itself as we go forward, and that was certainly the case with MTS, and I expect that there will be others at some point. But I would not speculate as to one.\nJeffrey Sprague: And just one quick house cleaning one for Michael. The unallocated cost has kind of been running higher all year and bumped up a little bit more? Like what's going on there? And what should we expect?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think during the last four quarters, we're averaging about $30 million or so. And there are certain costs that we don't allocate out to the segments, example is health and wealth are costs are going up year-over-year. And there's really a laundry list of things there. I would assume that we'll stay somewhere in that 30% to 40% range on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: I love your slide deck. 6 real slides, 15 minutes of prepared comments, that's best-in-class from what I can tell. I appreciate the brevity and the information. Anyways, just switching gears a little bit. I mean it's a little bit of a hard to perhaps measure, but your comment maintaining world-class service levels. When you think about your on-time deliveries kind of today versus where they were few quarters ago versus perhaps pre-pandemic? Are they back up to kind of comparable levels? Did they ever slip that much? I'm sure your competitors - some of your competitors probably had major problems.\nScott Santi: Yes. It is a bit of a summation of a number of different cases, but I would say, certainly, there are a number of our businesses that have sustained their traditional order and they ship tomorrow kinds of service levels throughout this environment, although I have had to certainly work a lot harder with a lot more brute force given the environment to make that happen. In some other cases, I'm thinking about, we've gone from ship tomorrow in order today to ship in a week. But I'm also thinking of cases where we've got people we compete with in certain markets that are now quoting deliveries into next year. So I think from a standpoint of relative advantage, I think we are - again, without 84 different cases, I can't necessarily excite every exact one of them, but my bet is that we are - that the relative advantage that we have is actually increased in that regard in terms of our ability to deliver in our service level to our customers in this pandemic period.\nScott Davis: And does that make it, Scott, easier to get price than given the value promise that you have in delivery and predictability and such that your customer doesn't have to hold a lot of extra inventory because they can have some faith that you guys are going to be there for them.\nScott Santi: I would imagine that's certainly part of it. I think the overall dimension of the value add in terms of the IP relationship as we try to outserve to give our customers the best overall value prop in terms of both the performance of the products we supply them, the service we delivered put around those, and it's not just the delivery service, it's service those businesses where we have service positions like food equipment. And so I think in all of that, I think all of our customers are well aware of their raw material environment. So I think from the standpoint of overall value delivery, our value to them, to the environment that we're in and the fact that we're just trying to recover on a dollar for dollar, we're not trying to get the margin back. I think, as we said before, because we're interested in and expanding our relationships with those customers, I think all of that speaks to the fact that we've been able to recover dollar for dollar.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Good job given the challenging environment. I guess just my first question, just on the margins on the construction business. You were up, the margins were down a little. So just trying to get some color there and when we can see sort of margin recovery. And then my second question, can you just give us an update on sort of what the opportunities are sort of the M&A pipeline and could help - could that further supplement the growth opportunity going forward?\nMichael Larsen: Jamie, I think you may have missed it. We just talked about the M&A pipeline a few minutes ago with Jeff. So I'm going to skip that.\nJamie Cook: I'm sorry [indiscernible]...\nMichael Larsen: It's okay, don't worry about it. I mean I think in terms of construction as we look at kind of the margins on a year-over-year basis, good enterprise initiative contributions, good volume leverage. And then the headwind is really on the price/cost side. So we talked in this segment, in particular, steel costs are a significant headwind. Obviously, offset with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, like are in line with our policy here but still margin dilutive pretty significantly at over 300 basis points here in the third quarter. I think once the timing in terms of when is that going to be - when is that impact going to start to diminish is difficult to say. What we can say with a high degree of confidence is and also at this point to our track record, our ability to read and react to whatever cost increases come our way and respond appropriately and decisively with price. I think kind of that track record speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do that. And we're certainly hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we're not counting on that as we look forward. And so you'll probably see a little bit of margin pressure in construction again here in Q4 relative to Q3. Q4 has some - we've got a couple of less shipping days, seasonality, typically, we go down in Q4 relative to Q3. But I'd say in terms of the long term, structurally, construction margins are going to be back in the high 20s at some point here once these near-term issues get resolved.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: So I know it's early to talk about '22, but maybe just big picture. Given the growth momentum in your businesses. Ex auto, up 11%, and auto potentially reflecting in '22, as you said. At this point, what's your conviction level that ITW can deliver, let's say, continuing above trend levels when we think about our longer-term goal of 3% to 5% organic growth. And maybe dovetailing with that, are any of your businesses actually snapping back faster than expected. Food equipment comes to mind that may continue to lead growth going into '22?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think, Andy, like we said, I mean, we certainly have some really good momentum in our businesses in Q3 and Q4, if you kind of set the auto situation aside, those businesses are up 10% organically. And like you said, there's some really positive momentum, particularly in the more CapEx-oriented businesses. So welding, test and measurement, food equipment, and then I think like we said, once the automotive production challenges get resolved, I think we're set up really well for a strong recovery down the road. We think potentially in 2022, we'll see some positive momentum as well in automotive OEM. So we've not rolled up the plans yet fully embedded the plans fully for 2022 yet. But - and until we've done that, I don't really want to go comment too much. We'll give you a full update in February, like we always do when we provide guidance. But certainly, in terms of demand the volume leverage that goes with that, the momentum on still on enterprise initiatives 9 years in. Our ability to deal with whatever cost and supply chain issues come our way. I think we're really well set up for 2022 and beyond.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Michael, that's helpful. And then you mentioned Q4, I mean there is some normal seasonality. You mentioned less shipping days. Obviously, you're forecasting EPS in the middle of the range to be down a little in Q3. Is there anything else going on? Is it maybe a lag in how costs still hit the P&L in auto and maybe polymers and fluids? And then would you say that Q4 maybe is the peak negative margin impact from materials and resins and that kind of stuff.\nMichael Larsen: Well, I hope so. We're not counting on it. I think if they don't go up anymore. Yes, look, what I can say just on the materials, I think the rate of increase - from Q2 to Q3, we saw a big step-up in our raw material cost inflation. I think it's unlikely we'll see the same thing here in Q4. I mean, we're already through October. But beyond that, who knows, I think, like I said, it's a typical seasonality for us. We go down from Q3 to Q4, revenues are down. Margins are down. We've got 2 less shipping days. Automotive OEM, we said down 20% year-over-year. The other 6 segments will all have positive organic growth. Margin performance in those segments will be similar to Q3, if not a little bit better. And then you just need to adjust for the tax rate, the discrete item, we gave you the detail on that in Q3 versus Q4. And then there is a little bit of currency headwind, which is really more of a rounding, but we have a little bit more currency headwind in Q4 than Q3. So - you put all of that together, you get to what hopefully is a risk-adjusted pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter, and we'll see where we go from here. So...\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.\nAnn Duignan: I'm laughing because it's like 20 years later. Perhaps just digging a little bit more. I know you've talked a lot about the momentum going into 2022, but you said in your nice brief opening comments, that other than automotive, some of your other businesses were actually doing better than you had expected. If you could just expand on that a little bit. And then on the food service equipment side, particularly on institutional, is there any risk that there's some pull forward of demand, a lot of institutions curtailed by the federal government with COVID aid. I mean, are you hearing anything about that driving demand on the institutional side. So broadly, first and then maybe a little bit more on the drivers of demand in Food Equipment.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think your first question kind of, I think, was what improved here relative to expectations. I mean food equipment and welding, certainly test and measurement. We did talk about on the last call, we had some onetime equipment orders in Q2. If you take those out, the momentum is really strong as well in the test and measurement business on the back of strong demand on the semiconductor side. So I'd point to those 3 as the strongest. In terms of the institutional side, we really don't think that there's a significant impact there. I mean from pull forward, overall, in the institutional side was up, like we said 20%, education was up 40%, but health so was health care. Health care was up 20%. So we don't really think that there's a significant impact. And we certainly haven't seen anything slowing down on the institutional side or really any of the other kind of end markets within Food Equipment.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. And then just following up on the Food Equipment side, are you seeing any changes in the types of equipment being demanded coming out of COVID, thinking about the changes to quick serve or to any restaurant side. Any notable like secular or structural changes in the types of equipment that are being ordered?\nMichael Larsen: Not really, Ann. No, I think this is very similar to kind of our normal product mix, if you like. So there's no real impact from that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: Can we spend a minute just talking about auto OEM margins and pricing - So my understanding is that historically, you guys price when you win your platforms, and it's difficult sometimes to get back and try to get price from auto OEMs? And so what I'm trying to understand, I guess, is like at what point do we start to see kind of the equation turn positive for you from a price cost perspective and thinking about the potential recovery for those margins longer term?\nScott Santi: Yes, our - structurally derived under normal circumstances that generally, the pricing is much more sort of contractually negotiated in the auto space relative to the rest of our businesses. What I would say in regards to this current situation is the delta of inflation, raw material cost is certainly one where we're having discussions about with our customers about needing to adjust that. And we're not clearly the only ones in that respect with our auto customers. So we're working through that. I would say it's certainly - it remains the segment with the biggest lag in terms of our ability to recover, but ultimately, those - we're going to - our approach there is the same as it is in the rest of the company is that we're going to expect to get full recovery on the dollar amount of inflation that we're seeing. And I'd say the margin issue there is sort of the price cost is somewhat of an issue in the short run, but it's much more value. There's a lot of volume leverage there. And as we start - shipments start improving, volumes start to recover given some of the supply chain snacks get resolved, then we'll have - there's nothing that I see that won't get us back to sort of prior peak in terms of auto margins and have them go up from there as we grow that business.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. And if it helps, Joe. I'll just add, if you're a little worried about margins here in the near term in auto. I mean, I think we just did 17%, which I think is in this industry is probably top-tier performance, if not best-in-class. And I think in Q4, we expect maybe the typical step down from Q3 to Q4, but margins will still be solidly in the mid-teens. Overall, for the company, I think what we're - what's implied in our guidance is operating margins for Q4 and that 22%, 23% range. And so hopefully, that helps you quantify anything that you may be worried about in terms of the margin performance here.\nJoseph Ritchie: Yes. No, that's really helpful. I appreciate that color from both of you. And I guess just my one follow-up is just on MTS. It's funny, like I almost had forgotten that you guys had acquired the company or to or in the process of acquiring the company. I guess - can you elaborate a little bit on what's taking so long? I think I think you've got announced in the first quarter. And then...\nScott Santi: Yes, I don't want to do that, Joe. We're at the I don't know, 2-yard lines. So let's just leave things where they are, and we'll get it over the goal line here soon.\nJoseph Ritchie: Okay. Is there anything you can tell us about the accretion from the business? Because we have it kind of sized like roughly $500 million business with like high 20s type gross margin. So any thoughts on potential accretion into 2022 if it closes this year?\nMichael Larsen: I think in year one, kind of we've said EPS neutral, we think that's still the case. I mean there's going to be a little bit of purchase accounting upfront here. And we didn't buy this business for what it's going to contribute to EPS or not in 2022. This is really much more of a long-term play. In terms of size, you can go back and look pre-COVID. I mean, your numbers are about right, a little over think it was $560 million in '19. The purchase price of $750 million is what we disposed entry margins, 6% EBIT in a space that we know quite well, and I think you're familiar with the Instron business. So we're really excited about getting this over the goal line and welcoming the MTS team to the ITW family and get to work. The one benefit is we've had a lot of time to get ourselves organized around integration planning and everything we've seen has confirmed what we saw in due diligence in terms of the raw material and how well we think this business is going to perform over the next 3,5 years plus.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Just wanted to follow up on the near-term organic growth outlook. So it looks like, I think, implied volume growth year-on-year is maybe down in Q4 for ITW overall year-on-year. If you've got sort of pricing up mid-single digits. I just wanted to check that that's roughly the right way to think about it on volumes? And is that auto OE-related anything else where the volumes are soft? And how confident you feel in that overall sort of market share recapture effort?\nMichael Larsen: But to answer your question, it's all automotive OEM here in Q4 with revenues down 20%. The other 6 or 7 businesses are performing like we said at a really high level combined. If you just look at the other 6 segments, organic growth is almost 10% in Q4, or projected to be 10% margins, 25% plus, similar to what they - these businesses did in Q3. And so it's really this near-term issue in auto OE that's making the numbers look a little different than what we normally do.\nJulian Mitchell: Understood. And then just circling back on the divestment aspect. I think you discussed acquisitions a couple of times. In the recent past, you've talked about divestments maybe being on the table next year. And certainly, we've started to see some other industrial companies divesting assets now because valuations are very, very elevated. Just wanted sort of your latest thoughts on that divestment aspects, clearly multiples are high, just wanted sort of if you are planning to wait a bit more just to let the operating profit keep growing.\nMichael Larsen: Well I think this is a reminder to - so you said we pulled back on these planned divestitures right when COVID hit. That was not a good time to sell these businesses and we had a few other things going on and we really - And I think we said this, we thought these businesses would be worth more coming out the other side, and that's absolutely going to be the case, not just in terms of the underlying performance of these businesses. It's significantly better than before. And then you're right, we expect multiples have certainly gone up. And so we think that early next year will be a good time to kind of relaunch some of these processes. If you go back to when we announced this program. this plan in 2018, we've got a little less than half of the divestitures completed at this point. So we've got another $300 million to $500 million worth of businesses here, revenues that we're taking a close look at.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: And Michael, good to have you back on the call. I want to just maybe ask Joe's question on a slightly different way. I know you have a multi-year contracts with the OEMs. But just given the extreme pressure on inflation, do you have any mechanism to pass along that by surcharges, et cetera? So just curious. And the spirit of my question is that if we do see volume recovering to maybe not 2022 but 2023 are we still going to be little bit under water on sort of the inflation recovery assuming you can't try to all the contracts in the .\nMichael Larsen: Scott talked about the contractual nature of the industry and so it's taking a little bit longer to get those prices adjusted and it's hard for us to say as we sit here how that going to play out next year. I think what happens ultimately - and we can go back and look what happened in '18 which was the last kind of inflationary cycle and then how we got way ahead of those cost in '19 and that's eventually how this will play out. Exactly when that happens is difficult to say. I'll just bring up the point in terms of the benefit we have from not being an auto company but being a multi-industry with a high quality diversified set up businesses that are differentiated and demonstrated again this year that every business can get price when faced with some pretty unprecedented levels of inflation, and that will be no different on a go-forward basis. We'll be - I think we're really well positioned to read and react in all of our segments, and then auto will take a little bit longer. So I think maybe that's the way to think about it.\nScott Santi: Yes. Maybe just the one thing I'd add is that these are - while we talk about sort of the contractual elements of these relationships. They're also partnering with it. These are cooperative relationships. We've been partners with our customers for a long time. So I think given the environment, whether - and I don't think it's the contractual provisions that are the ultimate obstacle, it's about what's fair for both parties and each of us working together in the current environment. So I wouldn't overly - I don't know if this is word contractualize these relationships. These are long-term relationships with partners who need us and we want to do our best to serve them. And so there's - it will all be worked out.\nMichael Larsen: And maybe I'll just add, the price/cost equation is one element of the margin expansion here at ITW. I mean, if you look at the volume leverage that we're getting with just a little bit of organic growth, and look at the incremental margins here, once price cost starts to settle down a little bit. And then we still have the enterprise initiatives. So. I wouldn't get too negative on the price cost side as you look into next year. And again, in February when we get together and give you guidance, we'll give you a lot more detail on this.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Fletcher.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Tammy. I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning for our short and efficient call, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. As Scott said, demand remained strong in Q3 with total revenue of $3.6 billion an increase of 8% with organic growth of 6%. Growth was positive in 6 or 7 segments, ranging from 3% to 22% and in all geographic regions, led by North America, up 9%; Europe, up 1% and; Asia, up 5%. China was up 2% versus prior year and up 6% sequentially. GAAP EPS of $2.02 was up 10% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.06. Operating income increased 7% and operating margin was flat at 23.8% despite significant price cost headwinds. Enterprise Initiatives were real positive again this quarter at 100 basis points, as was volume leverage, which contributed more than 100 basis points. Thanks to a great effort by our businesses, price cost was EPS-neutral in Q3 but still dilutive to operating margin percentage by 200 basis points as raw material cost increases further escalated in the third quarter. Throughout 2021, our businesses have quickly and decisively responded to raw material and logistics cost inflation with pricing actions in alignment with our policy to fully offset these cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And we've talked about this before, but given the current environment, I'll remind you that we don't hedge. So current cost inflation is always moving through our businesses in real time. After-tax return on invested capital was 28.5% and free cash flow was $548 million. Free cash flow conversion was 86% as our businesses have been very intentional about adding inventory to both support our growth and to mitigate supply chain risk and sustained world-class service levels for our customers. Overall, for the quarter, then strong growth in 6 of 7 segments and excellent operational and financial execution across the board. Let's go to Slide 4 for segment results. And before we get to the segment detail, the data on the left side of the slide illustrates our strong Q3 results with and without automotive OEM. I wanted to highlight 2 key points. The first is the benefit we derive from our high-quality diversified business portfolio in terms of the strength, resilience and consistency of ITW's financial performance. which is enabling us, in this case, to power through significant near-term headwinds in our largest segment and still deliver top-tier overall performance. The second is the accelerating growth momentum with strong core earnings leverage we're generating across the company. Excluding our auto OEM segment, given the issues affecting that market right now, the rest of the company collectively delivered organic growth of 11%. Operating income growth of 14% and an operating margin of 25% plus in Q3. As you can see on this slide, if you eliminate the price/cost impact, our core incrementals were a very strong 52% in the third quarter, which points to the quality of growth and profitability leverage that define the core focus of our business model and strategy. Now let's take a closer look at our segment performance in Q3, beginning with automotive OEM on the right side of this page. Organic revenue was down 11%, with North America down 12%, Europe, down 18%; and China, up 2%. And as Scott mentioned, supply chain-related production cutbacks were much larger in Q3 than what we and most, if not all, external auto industry forecasters were expecting heading into the quarter. While conditions in the auto market are obviously very challenging in the near term, but really good news from our standpoint is that the eventual and inevitable recovery of the auto market will be a major source of growth for ITW over an extended period of time once the current supply chain issues begin to improve and ultimately get resolved. Between now and whenever that is, we will remain fully invested and strongly positioned to support our customers and seize incremental share gain opportunities as production accelerates coming out the other side of this situation. Turning to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, and organic revenue growth was very strong at 19% and the Food Equipment recovery that began in Q2 continues to gain strength. North America was up 18% with equipment up 20% and service up 14%. Institutional revenue, which is about 1/3 of our revenue, increased more than 20%, with strength in education, up over 40% and health care and lodging growth of around 20%. Restaurants were up almost 50% with strength across the board. Strong demand is evident internationally as well with Europe up 20% and Asia Pacific, up 23%. Equipment sales led the way up 26% with service growth of 8%. In our view, this segment is in the early stages of recovery as evidenced by revenues that are still below pre-COVID levels. Test & Measurement and Electronics organic revenue was strong with growth of 12%. Test & Measurement was up 15%, driven by continued strength in customer CapEx spend and in our businesses that serve the semiconductor space. Electronics grew 8% and operating margin was 26.8%. So moving to Slide 6. Welding demand continued to be very strong with organic revenue growth of 22%. Equipment revenue was up 25% and consumables grew 18%. Our industrial businesses increased 32% in the commercial business, which sells to small businesses and individual users grew 18%. North America was up 24% and international growth was 12% with continued recovery in oil and gas, which was up 9%. Welding had an operating margin of 30% in the quarter. Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 3%, with demand holding steady at the elevated levels that began in Q3 of last year. And as such, had a tough comp of plus 6% a year ago. In Q3, growth was led by the Polymers business, up 8% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket grew 4% with sustained strength in the retail channel. And Fluids was down 5% due mostly to a decline in pandemic-related hygiene products versus prior year. Margins were 24.2% with more than 250 basis points of negative margin impact from price cost driven by significantly higher costs for resins and silicone. Moving to Slide 7. And a similar situation with construction, where organic growth was also up 3% and also on top of a strong year-ago growth rate of plus 8%. All 3 regions delivered growth with North America up 2%, with residential renovation up 1%, on top of a plus 14% comp a year ago and commercial was up 10%. Europe was up 8% and Australia and New Zealand was up 2%. Specialty organic revenue was up 8%, driven by continued recovery in North America, which was up 15%, and international was down 4%. Equipment sales were up 10% with consumables up almost 8%. Let's move on to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. As you saw in the press release, we're updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $8.30 to $8.50 which incorporates the impact of actual and anticipated lower automotive customer production levels in Q3 and Q4 versus our previous guidance on July 30. We now expect the Automotive OEM segment revenue to be down about 15% in the second half, including being down 20% in Q4 versus the forecast of roughly flat second half auto OEM revenues that was embedded in our previous guidance. All other segments remain on track or better versus our previous guidance. Our $8.40 midpoint equates to earnings growth of 27% for the full year. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.2 billion to $14.3 billion, which is up 13% at the midpoint, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Of that organic growth rate of 11% to 12% volume growth, including share gains are 8% with price of 3% to 4%. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 24%, which is up 100 basis points versus last year. And the fact that we're expanding margins at all in this environment is pretty strong performance, considering that we now expect raw material costs to be up 9% or more than $400 million year-over-year, which is more than 4x our expectation coming into this year. Our businesses are on track to offset raw material cost increases with pricing actions on a dollar-per-dollar basis, which, as you know, is EPS neutral but margin dilutive. As raw material costs and consequently, price have gone up more than what we predicted in our previous guidance, we now estimate margin dilution percentage impact from price cost for the full year at about 150 basis points versus our previous expectation of 100 basis points. These margin headwinds though, will be offset by strong volume leverage of about 250 basis points and another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives of more than 100 basis points. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of net income as we continue to prioritize sustaining our world-class service levels for our customers in this challenging environment, and as such, we will continue to invest in additional working capital to support our growth and mitigate supply chain risks. Our updated guidance is based on an expected tax rate for Q4 of 23% to 24% for a full year tax rate of approximately 19% to 20%. And as per usual process, our guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test and Simulation business. We are awaiting one final regulatory approval and expect to receive that and close the transaction in Q4. So in summary, this will be a record year for ITW with double-digit organic growth, margin expansion, strong cash flow and EPS growth of 25% plus. We expect this strong demand momentum to continue in Q4 and well into next year with an additional boost from automotive OEM likely at some point in 2022 as the supply chain issues there begin to improve. ITW remains very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Yes, I think during the last four quarters, we're averaging about $30 million or so. And there are certain costs that we don't allocate out to the segments, example is health and wealth are costs are going up year-over-year. And there's really a laundry list of things there. I would assume that we'll stay somewhere in that 30% to 40% range on a go-forward basis. Jamie, I think you may have missed it. We just talked about the M&A pipeline a few minutes ago with Jeff. So I'm going to skip that. It's okay, don't worry about it. I mean I think in terms of construction as we look at kind of the margins on a year-over-year basis, good enterprise initiative contributions, good volume leverage. And then the headwind is really on the price/cost side. So we talked in this segment, in particular, steel costs are a significant headwind. Obviously, offset with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis, like are in line with our policy here but still margin dilutive pretty significantly at over 300 basis points here in the third quarter. I think once the timing in terms of when is that going to be - when is that impact going to start to diminish is difficult to say. What we can say with a high degree of confidence is and also at this point to our track record, our ability to read and react to whatever cost increases come our way and respond appropriately and decisively with price. I think kind of that track record speaks for itself, and we'll continue to do that. And we're certainly hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we're not counting on that as we look forward. And so you'll probably see a little bit of margin pressure in construction again here in Q4 relative to Q3. Q4 has some - we've got a couple of less shipping days, seasonality, typically, we go down in Q4 relative to Q3. But I'd say in terms of the long term, structurally, construction margins are going to be back in the high 20s at some point here once these near-term issues get resolved. Well, I think, Andy, like we said, I mean, we certainly have some really good momentum in our businesses in Q3 and Q4, if you kind of set the auto situation aside, those businesses are up 10% organically. And like you said, there's some really positive momentum, particularly in the more CapEx-oriented businesses. So welding, test and measurement, food equipment, and then I think like we said, once the automotive production challenges get resolved, I think we're set up really well for a strong recovery down the road. We think potentially in 2022, we'll see some positive momentum as well in automotive OEM. So we've not rolled up the plans yet fully embedded the plans fully for 2022 yet. But - and until we've done that, I don't really want to go comment too much. We'll give you a full update in February, like we always do when we provide guidance. But certainly, in terms of demand the volume leverage that goes with that, the momentum on still on enterprise initiatives 9 years in. Our ability to deal with whatever cost and supply chain issues come our way. I think we're really well set up for 2022 and beyond. Well, I hope so. We're not counting on it. I think if they don't go up anymore. Yes, look, what I can say just on the materials, I think the rate of increase - from Q2 to Q3, we saw a big step-up in our raw material cost inflation. I think it's unlikely we'll see the same thing here in Q4. I mean, we're already through October. But beyond that, who knows, I think, like I said, it's a typical seasonality for us. We go down from Q3 to Q4, revenues are down. Margins are down. We've got 2 less shipping days. Automotive OEM, we said down 20% year-over-year. The other 6 segments will all have positive organic growth. Margin performance in those segments will be similar to Q3, if not a little bit better. And then you just need to adjust for the tax rate, the discrete item, we gave you the detail on that in Q3 versus Q4. And then there is a little bit of currency headwind, which is really more of a rounding, but we have a little bit more currency headwind in Q4 than Q3. So - you put all of that together, you get to what hopefully is a risk-adjusted pretty good outlook for the fourth quarter, and we'll see where we go from here. So... Yes. I think your first question kind of, I think, was what improved here relative to expectations. I mean food equipment and welding, certainly test and measurement. We did talk about on the last call, we had some onetime equipment orders in Q2. If you take those out, the momentum is really strong as well in the test and measurement business on the back of strong demand on the semiconductor side. So I'd point to those 3 as the strongest. In terms of the institutional side, we really don't think that there's a significant impact there. I mean from pull forward, overall, in the institutional side was up, like we said 20%, education was up 40%, but health so was health care. Health care was up 20%. So we don't really think that there's a significant impact. And we certainly haven't seen anything slowing down on the institutional side or really any of the other kind of end markets within Food Equipment. Not really, Ann. No, I think this is very similar to kind of our normal product mix, if you like. So there's no real impact from that. Yes. And if it helps, Joe. I'll just add, if you're a little worried about margins here in the near term in auto. I mean, I think we just did 17%, which I think is in this industry is probably top-tier performance, if not best-in-class. And I think in Q4, we expect maybe the typical step down from Q3 to Q4, but margins will still be solidly in the mid-teens. Overall, for the company, I think what we're - what's implied in our guidance is operating margins for Q4 and that 22%, 23% range. And so hopefully, that helps you quantify anything that you may be worried about in terms of the margin performance here. I think in year one, kind of we've said EPS neutral, we think that's still the case. I mean there's going to be a little bit of purchase accounting upfront here. And we didn't buy this business for what it's going to contribute to EPS or not in 2022. This is really much more of a long-term play. In terms of size, you can go back and look pre-COVID. I mean, your numbers are about right, a little over think it was $560 million in '19. The purchase price of $750 million is what we disposed entry margins, 6% EBIT in a space that we know quite well, and I think you're familiar with the Instron business. So we're really excited about getting this over the goal line and welcoming the MTS team to the ITW family and get to work. The one benefit is we've had a lot of time to get ourselves organized around integration planning and everything we've seen has confirmed what we saw in due diligence in terms of the raw material and how well we think this business is going to perform over the next 3,5 years plus. But to answer your question, it's all automotive OEM here in Q4 with revenues down 20%. The other 6 or 7 businesses are performing like we said at a really high level combined. If you just look at the other 6 segments, organic growth is almost 10% in Q4, or projected to be 10% margins, 25% plus, similar to what they - these businesses did in Q3. And so it's really this near-term issue in auto OE that's making the numbers look a little different than what we normally do. Well I think this is a reminder to - so you said we pulled back on these planned divestitures right when COVID hit. That was not a good time to sell these businesses and we had a few other things going on and we really - And I think we said this, we thought these businesses would be worth more coming out the other side, and that's absolutely going to be the case, not just in terms of the underlying performance of these businesses. It's significantly better than before. And then you're right, we expect multiples have certainly gone up. And so we think that early next year will be a good time to kind of relaunch some of these processes. If you go back to when we announced this program. this plan in 2018, we've got a little less than half of the divestitures completed at this point. So we've got another $300 million to $500 million worth of businesses here, revenues that we're taking a close look at. Scott talked about the contractual nature of the industry and so it's taking a little bit longer to get those prices adjusted and it's hard for us to say as we sit here how that going to play out next year. I think what happens ultimately - and we can go back and look what happened in '18 which was the last kind of inflationary cycle and then how we got way ahead of those cost in '19 and that's eventually how this will play out. Exactly when that happens is difficult to say. I'll just bring up the point in terms of the benefit we have from not being an auto company but being a multi-industry with a high quality diversified set up businesses that are differentiated and demonstrated again this year that every business can get price when faced with some pretty unprecedented levels of inflation, and that will be no different on a go-forward basis. We'll be - I think we're really well positioned to read and react in all of our segments, and then auto will take a little bit longer. So I think maybe that's the way to think about it. And maybe I'll just add, the price/cost equation is one element of the margin expansion here at ITW. I mean, if you look at the volume leverage that we're getting with just a little bit of organic growth, and look at the incremental margins here, once price cost starts to settle down a little bit. And then we still have the enterprise initiatives. So. I wouldn't get too negative on the price cost side as you look into next year. And again, in February when we get together and give you guidance, we'll give you a lot more detail on this."

            "content": "Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we saw continued strong growth momentum in 6 of our 7 segments and delivered excellent operational execution and financial results. Revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 6% and earnings per share of $2.02 was up 10%. At the segment level, organic growth was led by welding at plus 22%; food equipment at plus 19%; Test & Measurement and Electronics at plus 12% and specialty products at plus 8%. Our automotive OE segment continued to be impacted in the near term by auto production cutbacks associated with the well-publicized supply chain challenges affecting our auto customers. In Q3, auto production cutbacks ended up being significantly larger than what was projected heading into the quarter. And as a result, our auto OEM segment revenues were down 11% in Q3 versus the minus 2% we were expecting as of the end of June. In a very challenging environment, our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of executing for our customers and for the company. In Q3, our people leveraged the combination of ITW's robust and highly flexible 80/20 front-to-back operating system. The company is close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain capabilities and systems and our decision to stay fully staffed and invested through the pandemic to sustain world-class service levels for our customers. They also executed appropriate and timely price adjustments in response to rapidly rising raw material costs. And as a result, we were able to fully offset input cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in Q3, resulting in 0 EPS impact from price cost in the quarter. And, by the way, our teams also managed to continue to drive progress on our long-term strategy, execute on our Win the Recovery positioning initiative and deliver another 100 basis points of margin improvement benefit from enterprise initiatives. Moving forward, we remain very focused on sustaining our growth momentum and on fully leveraging the competitive strength of the ITW business model and the investments we have made and continue to make in support of the execution of our enterprise strategy. Before turning it over to Michael, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for all their efforts and for their dedication to keeping themselves and their ITW colleagues safe to serving our customers with excellence and to driving continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. Michael, over to you. Yes. I don't know a whole lot of nuances. I know that our customers expect us to be able to - as we've talked many times before, we work today, we ship tomorrow. In the auto space, we are certainly giving quarterly guides from our customers in terms of their production forecast. And obviously, those have been more volatile than normal of late. But I would say that we're not - there may be a little bit of inventory cushioning going on if you look at sort of build rates relative to our sales I think our sales were actually higher than production declines in Q3 by sort of an incremental margin about 3 percentage points. I don't know the exact number. But - so there may be a little bit of cushion building there just given the overall environment. But I would say once this thing starts to turn around, that we should see a pretty immediate effect. We've talked about this many times before. We are a very interesting opportunity to require. We get things run by us all the time. We have a very clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy and our financial criteria. And so there are things that are continuously being evaluated. But it's just a matter of the right opportunity presenting itself as we go forward, and that was certainly the case with MTS, and I expect that there will be others at some point. But I would not speculate as to one. Yes. It is a bit of a summation of a number of different cases, but I would say, certainly, there are a number of our businesses that have sustained their traditional order and they ship tomorrow kinds of service levels throughout this environment, although I have had to certainly work a lot harder with a lot more brute force given the environment to make that happen. In some other cases, I'm thinking about, we've gone from ship tomorrow in order today to ship in a week. But I'm also thinking of cases where we've got people we compete with in certain markets that are now quoting deliveries into next year. So I think from a standpoint of relative advantage, I think we are - again, without 84 different cases, I can't necessarily excite every exact one of them, but my bet is that we are - that the relative advantage that we have is actually increased in that regard in terms of our ability to deliver in our service level to our customers in this pandemic period. I would imagine that's certainly part of it. I think the overall dimension of the value add in terms of the IP relationship as we try to outserve to give our customers the best overall value prop in terms of both the performance of the products we supply them, the service we delivered put around those, and it's not just the delivery service, it's service those businesses where we have service positions like food equipment. And so I think in all of that, I think all of our customers are well aware of their raw material environment. So I think from the standpoint of overall value delivery, our value to them, to the environment that we're in and the fact that we're just trying to recover on a dollar for dollar, we're not trying to get the margin back. I think, as we said before, because we're interested in and expanding our relationships with those customers, I think all of that speaks to the fact that we've been able to recover dollar for dollar. Yes, our - structurally derived under normal circumstances that generally, the pricing is much more sort of contractually negotiated in the auto space relative to the rest of our businesses. What I would say in regards to this current situation is the delta of inflation, raw material cost is certainly one where we're having discussions about with our customers about needing to adjust that. And we're not clearly the only ones in that respect with our auto customers. So we're working through that. I would say it's certainly - it remains the segment with the biggest lag in terms of our ability to recover, but ultimately, those - we're going to - our approach there is the same as it is in the rest of the company is that we're going to expect to get full recovery on the dollar amount of inflation that we're seeing. And I'd say the margin issue there is sort of the price cost is somewhat of an issue in the short run, but it's much more value. There's a lot of volume leverage there. And as we start - shipments start improving, volumes start to recover given some of the supply chain snacks get resolved, then we'll have - there's nothing that I see that won't get us back to sort of prior peak in terms of auto margins and have them go up from there as we grow that business. Yes, I don't want to do that, Joe. We're at the I don't know, 2-yard lines. So let's just leave things where they are, and we'll get it over the goal line here soon. Yes. Maybe just the one thing I'd add is that these are - while we talk about sort of the contractual elements of these relationships. They're also partnering with it. These are cooperative relationships. We've been partners with our customers for a long time. So I think given the environment, whether - and I don't think it's the contractual provisions that are the ultimate obstacle, it's about what's fair for both parties and each of us working together in the current environment. So I wouldn't overly - I don't know if this is word contractualize these relationships. These are long-term relationships with partners who need us and we want to do our best to serve them. And so there's - it will all be worked out."

My name is Adam, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Adam. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and our Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy. Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen is recovering from a sports related injury and is not able to participate in today\u2019s call. We certainly wish Michael all the best and look forward to seeing him next week.  During today\u2019s call we will discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter financial results and update our guidance for the full year 2021. Slide two is a reminder that this presentation contains Forward-Looking Statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So please turn to slide three, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results.  Revenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%. We saw double digit growth in every segment and geography. Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the one-time tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.  In this strong demand environment and in the face of a very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits are staying fully staffed and invested through our win and recovery positioning, to continue providing world class service levels to our customers, while also continuing to execute on our long term strategy to achieve and sustain ITWs full potential performance.  We're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remain pretty much strong across the board, and during the second quarter we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses.  While there is no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years and ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers.  We worked hard over the last nine years the position ITW to deliver differentiated performance in any environment, and I have no doubt that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level as we move to the balance of the year and beyond.  Now for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across our seven segments. The two segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%. By geography, North America was up 36% and International was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.  GAAP EPS of $2.45 was up 143% and included a one-time tax benefit of $0.35 related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there. Excluding this item, EPS of $2.10 grew 108%. It was a Q2 record and was 10% higher than in Q2 of 2019.  Operating income increased 99% and incremental margin was 40% at the Enterprise level. Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives. Year-to-date our teams have delivered robust margin expansion with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price cost impact.  Speaking of price cost, price cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points. While the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year. Consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar for dollar basis.  In Q2 we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result net price cost impact reduced EPS by $0.001 in the quarter. We continue to expect price cost impact to be EPS neutral or better for the year, and I\u2019ll come back and provide more color on the price cost environment a little later in my remarks.  In the quarter after tax, return on invested capital was a record at 30.8%. Free cash flow was $477 million with a conversion of 72% of net income on adjusted for the one-time tax benefit I mentioned earlier. And that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth.  We continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year. We repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter as planned, and finally our tax rate in the quarter was 10.1% due to a one-time tax benefit. Excluding this item, our Q2 tax was 23%.  Now moving to slide four for an updated on price cost. We continue to experience raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost 5 percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began. And just for some perspective, this is roughly 2x of what we experienced in the 2018 inflation TerraCycle.  We learned a lot from that experience and as a result of the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions, are well ahead of where we were in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect price cost impact to be EPS neutral or better for the full year, with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar for dollar basis.  Price costs will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage, however in the near term as we saw in Q2 the net impact will likely be modestly higher in Q3 versus Q2 before it starts to go the other way. For the full year we expect price cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.  That being said, margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative affect of price cost and margin percentage, and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year. And beyond the near term price cost impact, we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris for some comments on our segment performance in Q2. Chris. \nChris O'Herlihy : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide five, the table on the left provided some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses when we look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2.  I would expect the pace of recovery in our Auto OEM segment has been dampened by the well-publicized shortage of semi-conductor chips, despite very strong underlying demand, and for that reason we added a role to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex-auto. Our Q2 revenue ex-auto increased 8% versus Q1. This year Q2 had one more shipping date in Q1, so on an equal day basis our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth and ex-auto is 6%, which is 2x of our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonality of plus 3%. In addition, we added more than $200 million of backlog in Q2. Both of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in Q2 across our portfolio.  Now let\u2019s go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with automotive OEM. Demand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84% organic growth. This of course was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May. North America was up 102%, Europe was up 106% and China up 20%.  We estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 26.6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Price cost was a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the long recycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment.  Given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in automotive to be approximate 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year. To be clear, this is not lost revenue, but simply delayed into next year. Furthermore, the slower than expected growth in auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise.  Please turn to slide six for Food Equipment. In Food Equipment organic revenue rebounded 46% with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. North America was up 39% with equipment up 42% and service up 33%. Institutional revenue was up more than 30% with health care and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s. Restaurants were up about 60% with the largest year-over-year increases in Food Service and QSR.  Retail grew in the mid-teens and continued solid demand and new product rollouts. International recovery was also robust at 58% with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%. Equipment sales were strong 66%, with service growth of 39%, which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in Europe. Operating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%.  Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%. Test & Measurement was up 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer CapEx spend and continued strength in semicon. Electronics grew 38%, continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications, and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in Electronic Assembly. Operating margin of 28.1% was 240 basis points \u2013 was up 240 basis points and a Q2 record.  Moving to slide seven, welding growth was also strong in Q2 at 33%. Equipment Revenue was up 38%, and consumables growth of 25% was the time in positive territory since 2019. Our industrial business grew 52% on increased CapEx spending by our customers and the commercial business remained solid, up 26% following 17% growth in the first quarter. North America was up 38% and International growth was 13%, primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas.  Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 28%, led by our automotive aftermarket business up 33% on robust retail sales. Polymers were up 34% with continued momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries. Fluids is up 8% with North America growth in the mid-teens and European sales up low single digits. Operating margin was an all-time record of 27.3% with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partially offset by price cost.  Moving to slide eight. Construction organic grew up to 28% reflected double digit growth and recovery in all three regions. North America was up 20% with 16% growth in residential renovation and with 26% growth in commercial construction.  Europe grew 61% with strong recovery versus easy comps in the UK and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand organic growth was 13% with continued strength in residential and commercial. Operating margin in the segment of 27.6% was up 390 basis points and was a Q2 record.  Specialty organic revenue was up 17% with North America up 15%, Europe up 24% and Asia Pacific up 14%. Our Flexible Packaging business was up mid-single digit against tougher comps than the rest of the segment. The majority of our businesses were up double digits, led by appliance up more than 50%. Consumable sales were up 19% and equipment sales up 12%.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott. \nScott Santi : Thanks Chris. Let's move on to slide nine for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus-3%.  This is an increase in organic growth of one percentage point at the mid-point versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of Q1, driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases.  While demand momentum accelerated in Q2 versus Q1 as we noted earlier in our presentation, we are admittedly being conservative in not projecting that forward in our guidance at this point in time, given the significant supply chain disruptions that continue to challenge many of our customers in auto and otherwise.  We are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the one-time tax benefit realized in the second quarter. The mid-point of 875 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019. Factoring out the one-time Q2 tax side in the mid-point of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019.  With regard to margin percentage as discussed earlier, the incremental cost increases that we saw in Q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we project [Audio Gap] to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year-over-year and an all-time record for the company. And again, we expect zero EPS impact from price cost for the full year.  We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income factoring out the impact of the one-time, non-cash, tax benefit we recorded in Q2. Through the first half we have repurchase 500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional 500 million in the second half. Finally we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for our full year tax rate of around 20%.  Lastly, today\u2019s guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to close later this year. Once that acquisition closes we\u2019ll provide you with an update.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to you Karen. \nKaren Fletcher : Okay, thank you, Scott. Adam, lets open up the lines for questions please. \nOperator: Yes ma'am. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : Best wishes to Michael! \nScott Santi: Thank you. He\u2019s on short term IR, but he\u2019ll be back next week. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : Excellent! So Scott or Chris, you mentioned the raw material cost inflation. We know when you said inflation will be as usual better for the year. Do you see the inflationary pressure stabilize enough where you can have a handle on these increases that you sort of put into the guide. So when you look at Q3 and Q4, you have confidence in your forecast. And then in \u201822 you talked about last quarter, what\u2019s the probability that these price increases are pretty sticky so you could exceed that 35% to 40% longer term incremental you have. \nScott Santi: Well, on the first question I think we're very confident that we will cover whatever, you know all the increases that have already been incurred and anything subsequent to that, I would not be comfortable describing the environment as stabilizing at this point, but ultimately I think we have demonstrated. We\u2019ve looked back over the last \u2013 you know going back to 2017 and even in \u201818 and certainly this year, you know sort of on a quarterly basis worst impacts on price costs and inflationary environments have been a $0.001, you know may be $0.02 one quarter.  So I think we're fully comfortable that we\u2019ll be able to read and react to whatever might happen from here that the EPS impact of the company will be negligible for the full year, but I think as I said, I don't \u2013 it's not based on an assumption that things are going to stabilize from here for sure. I don't think we're seeing \u2013 we\u2019ve seen enough evidence of that and normally I\u2019d predict things are going to continue to reach forward either. I think its wait and see. \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: We saw a significant pickup in the case of inflation in Q2, yeah. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : Guys maybe I could just ask the question specific to auto in the sense that you know you give us the numbers, you know now 10% for the year. I think this quarter you said 200 basis points to price risk cost. As you know there is always a lag before you can catch up there. So should we assume incremental margin is still getting a little worse before it gets better in that business, and how long would you surmise it takes to get on top of price risk costs in that business? \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Well, price versus cost in auto is always going to be challenging given the, you know the nature of the industry. I would say in terms of incremental in the second quarter in auto we had a 47% incremental, an impact of 47% incremental you know for the first half of the year. So incrementals are strong in auto no double, but there is no doubt that the structure of the industry, the structure of the pricing agreements, it does take a lot longer. Hard to say how long it will take for us to catch up there with that. \nAndrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with J.P. Morgan. \nAnn Duignan: Hi! Good morning. \nA - Scott Santi: Good morning.\nAnn Duignan: Maybe you could talk a little bit more about both, construction products and Test & Measurement where you said you delivered or you did deliver a record Q2 operating profit footprint. Can you talk about how sustainable those margins are going forward? Was there anything in Q2 mix or anything that we should be aware of that would result in those margins diminishing from here or are those sustainable at these levels? \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yes, so we\u2019ll say the construction margins are very sustainable. We\u2019ve been improving via the construction for a long time now and certainly for the last few quarters here we've been in the mid to high 20s in terms of margin and construction. So despite the price cost environment, we\u2019re seeing nice organic growth in construction. We are getting nice price realization and so we\u2019re then starting to expect the margins there to be sustainable.  Surely in Test and Measurement margins again you know currently in the high 20s here and have been like that for a long time. The segment that we like in terms of level of differentiation, I believe it\u2019s our customer problems. So we don\u2019t see any issue with sustaining margins in either Test & Measurement or Construction. \nAnn Duignan: Okay. [Cross Talk] Go ahead, sorry.\nScott Santi: I was going to add some color commentary that I think I was adding up the time when Chris was reading the comments, but I think we said all time record margins for Q2 and Q3 of our seven segments despite the price cost environment. And I\u2019ll just circle back to a comment I made, which is you know there is still room to run in terms of structural margin improvement across the company. We got 150 basis points of enterprise initiative benefit in this quarter. So there is, you know these are certainly sustainable improvements and performance and we expect to continue to do better as we go forward. \nAnn Duignan: Okay, I\u2019ll leave it there in the interest of time. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. \nStephen Volkmann : Hey! Good morning guy. Maybe just following up on the comment about Enterprise Initiatives, you know you're talking about I think 100 basis points for the year, but you did 150 this quarter, I think 120 if I have my number's right. Last quarter you\u2019ve been over overachieving. Did those slow down for some reason or is there a chance that you did better than 100 this year? \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, I mean, I think we are saying 100 plus, so we will do better than 100 this year. And there's still a lot of interest on our price initiatives bought on sourcing and in \u201920. You know these are all initiatives and activities that are very granular within out segments. Within each division there is a host of activity that we are working on. And actually have been working on not just this year, but even starting last year, so we entered the year with a fair bit of tailwind in terms of enterprise initiatives. So we would expect to do a 100 plus for sure. \nStephen Volkmann : And then maybe just following up on this price cost kind of question, just curious about how you think about the policy here. I mean it doesn't feel like there's a lot of pushback on pricing in any of the kind of verticals that we touch. You know why not price $4 plus margin, you know why kind of create that headwind? \nScott Santi: Well, I don't know. You know the headwind from my perspective is a percentage headwind, it's not an earnings headwind. You know the overall position that we wanted, we\u2019ve created an incredibly profitable economic engine and the most important job we have is to grow it organically, and so from the standpoint of \u2013 to the extent we don't have to go up as high as other people do, we are leveraging that strong position and we can translate that into incremental share, that\u2019s the preferred option.  I don\u2019t want our people fighting over the next incremental. We ought to get the cost for sure, but then let\u2019s get on to talk with our customers about how we can help them improve their business you know operationally, technically from a sales standpoint and so that\u2019s basically it. We can certainly do more to get all distraction and try to price optimize in the short term, but I don\u2019t think that services our long term interest very well. We make plenty money, you know this is not a...\nStephen Volkmann : Fair point, thank you. Take care. \nOperator: And your next questions from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeff Sprague: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone.\nA - Scott Santi: Good morning, Jeff. \nJeff Sprague: Good morning. Could we just drill a little bit into the kind of the whole availability issue? We talked about you know price cost and obviously it's tied to the availability of supplies, but outside of auto which is very visible and obvious, are there clear places in your portfolio where either you're struggling to meet demand because of availability in your supply chain or your feeling on the customer side, perhaps you can deliver, but they don't want it, because they've got problems elsewhere down the line. Just wonder if you could give us some perspective on that, and any color on to what degree if any it may, just wondering the top line here in the quarter or into the balance of the year. \nScott Santi: I\u2019ll give you some overall color and then certainly let Chris giving some segment level, sort of business levels specifics if some things come to mind for him.  I would say, in terms of overall color, as we talked to our businesses around the world, there's no question that it is a daily battle that maintained supplier division as we service our customers. I would absolutely contend that we are doing better than most for a couple of reasons: One is the fact that we have long head, localized supply relationships with local manufacturing facilities, serving our customers locally. And then the other fact is what I \u2013 we talked about in our remarks, the fact that we kept all our people though the pandemic. We have not to scramble to bring people back.  So normally our supply chain manufacturing operations function in a very simple automated way. It\u2019s definitely taking a lot more, let\u2019s call it boot force for now, but I think we are not hearing any big issues from a standpoint of our own ability to supply our customers. It doesn't mean that there's not an occasional you know $2 bracket that shows up late and there is a couple of other machines that can\u2019t go on just making that out, but that\u2019s \u2013 I'm sure that\u2019s the case, but ultimately given the service level that we are now entering, you know as a standard part of our operating practices I would say that \u2013 I\u2019m very comfortable saying that we are working a lot harder than we normally have to, but ultimately performing pretty well.  I would say that the supply chain area beyond auto is much more of an issue for us on the demand side than the supply side and I\u2019d point to a couple of things, but we are seeing a lot of sort of timing changes in terms of orders and requirements, not because we can't deliver something, but because another supplier can deliver something to a customer. And I\u2019d also points to the $200 million of backlog, and we've talked about this before.  You know we should \u2013 basically today is what our customers ordered yesterday and so we operate with very little backlog and the fact that we built a couple of hundred million of backlog, I can\u2019t analyze every dollar of it, but my contention would be that that's a lot more to do the \u2013 for the customer delays than it is our own ability to supply.  And with that we\u2019ll see the $60 million in auto plus the $200 million in backlog, that\u2019s another 10 percentage points of organic growth in the second quarter. You know again, I\u2019m not necessarily contending that all of it could have gone, but my bet would be most of it and that\u2019s the only thing\u2026 [Cross Talk]\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, it\u2019s the only thing I would say is just our, this cost comps, I think all over its going to be 18-24, because here it really creates a lot of the packages for us in terms of more sort of simplified and streamlined cost offerings. Obviously it results in simplification of raw materials and components and that simplification and focus also extends to our suppliers.  The key part of our strategy and its worked for us for many years is to have these you know very strong and long lasting supplier partnerships and we are a key customer for most of our raw material suppliers. This becomes really, really important when supply chains become constrained and releasing that work to our benefit here in the last 12 months.\nJeff Sprague: Great! And just a second question. Just on the M&A pipeline, obviously you don't have the deal until you've got something to do it now. But you know can you give us a sense of how active your pipeline is? Have you been able to cultivate things, you know maybe handicap the odds of some of the things kind of coming in your strike zone? \nScott Santi: Well, I would tell you that we are excited about MPS. We are working hard to get that one finished off and you know that is what's kind of $50 million of annualized revenue, so that\u2019s you know certainly enough work to do for a little while anyway. I don\u2019t want to unnecessarily comment on the pipeline as much as to say we remain and will remain very interested in adding high quality businesses to the company, but so the timing of all that is always a subject of the quality of what opportunities present themselves.  So there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on, but it\u2019s not a matter of how big or small the pipeline is; it's more we're looking for a much narrower set of criteria than I think, so it's more a function of the quality of what\u2019s there than the quantity. \nJeff Sprague: Okay, understood, thanks. I\u2019ll pass this on. \nOperator: And your next question comes from a line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everyone.\nA - Scott Santi: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So I know that, I know you guys guide to organic growth trends, you know really not improving or declining and that\u2019s your power house, that\u2019s just in your policy going forward. I guess when I think about each of the different segments and how you're thinking about the sequentials from here, I don't really think about a lot of seasonality in your business, but maybe perhaps the construction business right, being a little bit seasonally weak during the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about sequential revenue for the segments throughout the rest of the year? We see obviously you've given us the auto guide, but really the other segments? \nA - Scott Santi: Yeah, you know I covered that I think overall in my comments, but you know we have sort of camped down the run rate that you know in terms of the guidance relative to run rate. You know Chris talked to you about the fact that in the second quarter we saw organic growth rates accelerate by a net 3 percentage points of beyond seasonality, and we basically did project that signal manning forward through the balance of the year because of the supply risk involved, the supply chain risk to our customers, so we\u2019re playing that pretty conservative. And I think that ultimately is going to have more to do with the pace of the organic from here than you know trends of demand. There\u2019s plenty of demand out there. It\u2019s a matter of can our customers get enough raw material to support it. \nJoe Ritchie: Got it. And maybe Scott just following on that, like is there \u2013 you know you had mentioned about involving the Food Equipment business. Is it like where you're building backlog right now, is that \u2013 are you seeing that as more kind of like a 2022 opportunity, just given what you're seeing from a supply chain standpoint or does he expect some of that to convert in the second half. \nScott Santi: I'd say some of it is to convert. I think the only one you know that's probably you know definitely into 2022 is the loan that Chris mentioned and not where this, you know this dip sort of doesn\u2019t look like it's going to get resolved any time soon. But I'd say most of the \u2013 the rest of that backlog, that $200 million, I would expect that to \u2013 given our customers can take it, because they can get the other components of things they need, that should certainly convert in the back half.  I think our \u2013 you know it just doesn't make sense to up the revenue guide when you know everyone is so supply constrained right now. That I can't say it any more simply than that and that's how we see how things play out. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to take things too far from where they are now in terms of run rate until we see how that all \u2013 how the supply issues play out in affecting our customers willingness to, you know the ability to take what they\u2019ve ordered from us and with more. But I would say it is definitely you know from simpler border rates and the overall demand is definitely enough there to do you know well better than what's in our guide is this pricing situation. It's you know significantly better from here forward. \nJoe Ritchie: Okay, yeah \u2013 no, that's helpful. I guess maybe one follow-up on price cost. I know we talked about it a little bit. You did mention that 3Q is expected to get a little bit worse from 2Q because they\u2019ll be put through some pricing actions in 2Q. So on this I guess I\u2019m just wondering, does this take a little bit of time for some of the pricing actions to take hold or why would the headwind get worse than 3Q?\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah Joe, I mean the only reason it\u2019s getting worse in Q3 is because of the pace of inflation in Q2. We saw significant pick-up in pace in Q2 and obviously there\u2019s a little bit of a lag, so we see a little bit of a worsening in Q3 based on what we know today, based on the cost increases we see and the known price increases, we see a little worsening in Q3 from Q2, only on the base of the pace of inflation in Q2. \nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you both. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Hey! I guess just two questions, one following up on the revenue outlook. Understanding why you\u2019d guide sort of conservatively, but is there any way you can help us understand just what you're seeing in terms of percentage increases on the order intake rate, like by segment just to help us sort of understand what's out there, and to what degree are you concerned? Is there any sort of double ordering that's happening as customers are worried they can't get stuff? And then I guess my follow-up question, obviously the organic growth is performed very stronger. There's particular segments or customers where you are more sort of confident that some of these, you know this organic growth is associated with you know market share wins that are actually you know sort of sustainable from here on. Thank you.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: So in terms of you know acceleration of organic growth, you know we're seeing it. Obviously we talked about all our work, it's going in a different way, but certainly in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, electronics and welding you know are certainly growing faster than we expected earlier in the year, so we\u2019re seeing a nice acceleration there.  And you know we have no reason to believe that it's not sustainable based on our conversation with our customers, the order patterns and so on and you know obviously as we want to talk about the factor \u2013 it\u2019s already busy here in terms of this winged recovery initiative you know over the last 12 months and you know it is still kind of early to quantify this.  We\u2019re feeling pretty good about how we\u2019re positioned and we \u2013 as you know we're very intentionally remain fully staffed to serve our customers, protect the investments and people and in addition to the customer backed innovation and suite of excellent and certainly there\u2019s a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that would say that that is turning into share gains and if I ever just maybe highlight some, get the sort of examples and like sort of equipment where you know high level product availability, maintaining service level excellence as Scott talked about and being able to respond in supply where a competitor could not is enabling several share gain and incremental wins from competition in large chains, both in food service and food retail.  Another example might be in farmers [ph] influence, automotive aftermarket. Staying invested here we will sustain our sales and innovation focus, coupled with high service levels means we grew as I mentioned in the commentary, automotive aftermarket grew by 33% in the quarter and this is well above customer point sales growth indicating that we are getting share in a meaningful way. And in our measurements and construction in our roofing businesses, in association of 45% in the quarter, again we\u2019d see very clearly we're gaining share there on competition who have certainly been supply chain and operationally constrained, extending delivery times and so on and we continue to maintain differentiated service levels. So again, somewhat anecdotal, somewhat early in the window recovery strategy, but certainly ample evidence that we seem to be regaining share, and these are just a small selection of illustrative examples of tech products that we\u2019re making across our seven segments. \nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you. Anything on the order intake if you can share with us just what you're seeing, that you saw that by segment. \nA - Scott Santi: You know we saw in acceleration the three segments that I mentioned in\u2026 [Cross Talk]. \nJamie Cook: I was just trying to get numbers. You know I mean if you can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine.\nA - Scott Santi: Yeah, orders pretty much equalize shipments for last because of what I said, you know what we \u2013 what \u2013 our customers\u2019 orders we shipped the next day, I would say that also your closer to about \u2013 I think you used the term double dip ordering in terms of customers trying to hedge you know orders more because they can\u2019t get supply. I actually can\u2019t say that we\u2019re not seeing any of that, but I would say that it would be much lower for us because of the fact that our service levels are so good and our customers understand you know in terms of orders shipped.  So you know some maybe certainly ordering more than they would normally, because they are concerned about things, but I will think that even in terms of our service levels we wouldn\u2019t \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be anything \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be a significant part of the overall demand picture for us.\nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning and best wishes to Michael, hoping he gets a speedy recovery.\nScott Santi: Thanks Nigel.\nNigel Coe: That\u2019s okay. I want to go back to the supply constraint. Where are you kind of most \u2013 and I thought of automotive which was predictable, but where are you most concerned? I\u2019m thinking about maybe electronics perhaps tools you know with the barriers, but what are you monitoring most closely in terms of not just for Illinois Tool Works but for your, you know your supply chain, which business or geography are you most concerned?0\nA - Chris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, I would say electronics in general you know have been fairly constrained, so that impacts segments like well in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement and electronics will be one that I would call out. The [inaudible] obviously has been across the board in terms of steel, resins, chemicals and electronics, but in terms of supply chain constrains, electronics and certainly you know steel related business.\nScott Santi: But beyond that I don't think there's anything that really concentrates up. You know I think again the color from our businesses, you know it's something different every day, but you know it\u2019s not a \u2013 you now it takes a lot more work and it's not even the big dollar stuff. It's again the $2 bracket, but it is a real offer right now, significantly more than\u2026 [Cross Talk]\nNigel Coe: And then [inaudible] the two best offices because of the high volume service plan. I wouldn\u2019t think it could have created a big issue for you, but maybe address those two points and because that you know it could change very quickly, so I\u2019m just wondering you know what impact from the spot purchases and the 3x betting. \nScott Santi: Spot purchases, if you can explain that a little more Chris.\nA - Chris O\u2019Herlihy: I think given another company would purchase them with some hedges\u2026\nA - Scott Santi: Yeah, we don\u2019t have it and we don\u2019t forward by. So you know everything \u2013 the current costs are flushing through right now, yeah.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: And the second part of your question is I think related to freight and logistics, is that correct? And so with freight and logistics, I mean obviously there's no impact for us, but I don\u2019t see a less of an impact than some of our peers maybe on the basis that the produce what we sell \u2013 the produce and so what we sell, the philosophy that we\u2019ve long had that certainly mitigated the impact of freight and logistics on our cost structure and availability. \nNigel Coe: Thanks guys.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning guys. \nA - Scott Santi: Good morning Scott.\nScott Davis: Hope Mike feels better. There must be a good story, backstory to the sports injury. \nScott Santi: It\u2019s his to tell. \nScott Davis: Hopefully he didn\u2019t join some sort of football team or something, you know the over 50 football team. Anyways, I only have one question. It\u2019s just on MTS. When you bring in MTS, how do you \u2013 how do you cadence 80/20? You know I mean how do you bring in a deal of this size, kind of bring 80/20 in without really disrupting it. Is there kind of a playbook there you guys can walk through and help us understand?\nA - Scott Santi: Yeah, absolutely Scott. So obviously you know we\u2019ve completely reinvigorated 80/20 of the last two years with this front to back process and the fact that we \u2013 the process that we will employ on MTS is exactly the same process that we have employed on our 84 divisions across the company.  So we can\u2019t really decide on what to do, we can\u2019t really decide on how to do it and we can\u2019t really decide on what the outcome should be when we get it done properly. Coupled with the fact that we\u2019ve built a tremendous amount of capability in the company, our folks can go in and help you know guide MTS on the 80/20 journey.  So we feel very confident in the playbook, we feel very confident in our capability. We think the raw material in MTS are fantastic with respect to 80/20 opportunity, that\u2019s one of the key attractions for us and when we bought it. The other thing I\u2019d say is that we got a very similar business in our portfolio, in Test & Measurements and this time where we\u2019ve done this successfully before. So we are very confident that we can do this and do this successfully. \nScott Santi: [Cross Talk] It\u2019s probably a three to five years process, and part of that is not disrupting the business. \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: It\u2019s really the pace that makes sense, we are in no rush here. \nScott Davis: Okay, super helpful. Good luck! Thank you. \nScott Santi: Thank you. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. \nMig Dobre: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Going back to your comments on pricing, obviously a lot changed over the past three months and can you maybe clarify for us what impact pricing had to your adjustment, to the overall organic growth guidance?\nScott Santi: For the year?\nMig Dobre: Yes, please, thanks. \nScott Santi: Yeah, it's 1%. \nMig Dobre: Okay, I'm presuming then that.\nChris O\u2019Herlihy: That was the 1% we added to organic, yeah. \nMig Dobre: Okay, that's kind of what I figured, but I just wanted to confirm. So you know if this is impacting the back half of the year primarily, then at lease presumably you\u2019ll have a couple of points of growth just from pricing in the back half.  If I look at the implied guidance, credits, the high-end we are talking about growing something like 7% organically, a couple of points of that is just your incremental price, and I mean look Scott, you were talking earlier, saying hey, I'm trying to take a conservative approach here, but at least to me when I'm adjusting out for this pricing element and I think about the comparisons that are still you know fairly easy relative to the prior year, it just strikes me that you really are being conservative here in terms of how you're thinking about your business progression on a fixed price, on a core basis.  So just to kind of clarify this, is it that there\u2019s some lack of clarity as to where maybe demand is going to be because of what's happening with the supply chain, or is it that you're having some second thoughts with regards to how you're going to be able to convert revenue given your, some of the destruction that you're having to deal with. \nScott Santi: It\u2019s the former not the latter, if I understand you correctly. Taking a risk for us by far is customer supply chain, and what that does to their demand patterns from here on out.  It is \u2013 as I said before, it's about as volatile of a situation as I've seen in my career at ITW, and so I don't \u2013 I'm not trying to be mysterious about it. I think until we see that start to stabilize, it\u2019s just really hard to be comfortable sort of raising \u2013 I know we are serving the demand we have today really well and sort of run rate from the standpoint that our customers are able to sustain, and I think we are comfortable continuing to \u2013 our ability to do that will continue on for the back half.  There is a lot more orders and a lot more demand and that\u2019s again why we built backlog, that\u2019s \u2013 there is not a demand question. If we had, we \u2013 our customers had sort of unimpaired supply chains right now, we would have probably had 10 more points in the second quarter on this. It\u2019s not a fact, that\u2019s just my opinion.  But you know just looking at the backlog, and so I think demand is certainly much stronger right now given the pace of the recovery, it\u2019s just the matter off from the standpoint of all the supply chain issues and the risks for our customers. Their pace of being able to \u2013 you know what they ultimately need from us. As I said it\u2019s just hard to justify going up with a lot of confidence from here, but it\u2019s more their supply side than their demand side, if that makes sense. \nMig Dobre: Yeah, I think it does. The follow up to all of this is that we're starting to think about 2022 and you know if we're using your framework for the back half of \u201821 as a starting point and thinking about 2022. It begs the question as to how well growth is likely to look like next year, right, because there\u2019s nothing we can do when pricing normalizes next year, so you won't have the kind of tailwinds you have this year on that. \nScott Santi: We are not thinking about \u201822 much yet, but I would just you know say as a general rule, a lot of the supply chain disruption I think just pushes, adds to the duration of the recovery. I think there is plenty of business now, and because all of it can't be satisfied, a point of demand now and Chris will gave an example of auto.  This $60 million we couldn't ship in audio in the second quarter, that's not going away, that\u2019s just getting pushed out. We got dealer inventories at all-time lows, you know I forget what it was, less than a month, maybe less than a month I think I saw you know and so to the extent, I don't think it's necessarily the worst thing in the world that all this demand that\u2019s there right now can\u2019t be fully serviced, because it\u2019s going to allow us to \u2013 again this recovery duration gets extended by another two to four quarters maybe. We\u2019ll think harder about that as we get to that part of the year. \nMig Dobre: Okay, that's helpful. Lastly from me, on the top of M&A you talked about portions of your business that you consider for divestiture before, that you\u2019ve taken a step back on that this year. I'm sort of curious as activity has picked up multiples are pretty good. Will you reconsider this at a point of time down the like, maybe 2022? \nScott Santi: Yes. \nMig Dobre: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: And your next question comes from a line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi! Good morning. Maybe just a first question \u2013 good morning. Maybe just a first question around the free cash flow. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been touched on yet. You know your inventories and receivables are up each sort of 100 million plus sequentially. Just wondered how you see working capital playing out in the second half and what we should think about that as a sort of cash flow item for the year as a whole.  And also sort of more broadly on the CapEx side of things, you know how much is your CapEx coming up this year and have you revised at all your sort of median term CapEx planning assumptions because of these constraints? \nScott Santi: I think the best way to model our working capital requirements is our months on-hand and days sales outstanding. Sort of we managed the metrics on those. Generally speaking months on hand runs roughly 2.5 months, DSO I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head, but whatever the average is, 60-ish maybe, so that\u2019s where [inaudible] going to go.  Sales go up, month on hand is not going to go up, but the dollars invested, so today we stated that month on hand id going to go up. The same with receivables in terms of DSO. So it\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s something that happens automatically. We don\u2019t have to sort of force that to happen, but as sales go up, inventory is going to go up and the month on hand is a function of that\u2019s how 80/20 works. There is some element of it, that give us you know we want X amount of inventory to be able to product the ability to react and respond to our customers, you know order today shipped tomorrow kind of system.  So I think that\u2019s the best guidance I can give you on working capital. It\u2019s just not let through and whether that\u2019s cash flow, it\u2019s not going to be \u2013 you know when you are jumping up as much as we did in Q2, where Q1 is going to obviously require some incremental working capital.  And then the other question, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m trying to do my best Michael impersonation here as I can, so I\u2019m trying to think hard. \nJulian Mitchell: No, no it was just around the capital spending and sort of the rate of [Cross Talk] \nScott Santi: So CapEx, I think the plan for the year was up like $300 million or so. \nKaren Fletcher: $300 million is our target. \nScott Santi: Yeah, for the year. So there is no incremental CapEx. We did differ some incremental capacity investments last year because of the pandemic, we didn\u2019t need them. Those are certainly all coming back on, but those are \u2013 you know we operate with another element of 80/20 as we want to be front end loaded on capacity, that\u2019s how we serve our customers. So as business continues to go forward, we will continue to invest and stay in that sort of increment, you know meaningful increment ahead of current demand, but that wouldn\u2019t be again something out of the normal of what we always do and it wouldn\u2019t be some big sort of lump coming through. \nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s clear, thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on the auto OEM margins. Is the point that, you know after that step down sequentially in Q2, there is sort of 19%-ish level is a good base line or flow in the current sort of demand and cost environment. And so from here they move up sort of slowly given what\u2019s going, but 19 is where they should have bottomed out for now. \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yeah, that\u2019s a fair assumption. But we are seeing a bottom out here and I think it will be a slow recovery, based on what we are seeing today, a slow recovery from here on out. \nScott Santi: You must remember prior peak margins in auto, because it was probably 23 maybe. And so, there is still lot of item recovery to go in auto from where we were then and so I\u2019d say low to mid-20s is certainly achievable over time. \nJulian Mitchell: Thank you very much. \nScott Santi: Sure.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO.\nJoel Tiss: Hey there! Scott, you shouldn\u2019t be so hard on yourself. I think you guys sound a little less annoyed by how dumb all our questions are than usually. \nScott Santi: Now you know where the [inaudible] of the group is. \nJoel Tiss: So, I have like one topic and just two different angles on it. One, can you give us any sense if you think the food industry is kind of distracted with all the consolidation that's going on? And then can we have a little more color on kind of what customers are back? You know our large pieces of your end markets still not really there; I'm thinking like airports and cafeterias and things like that. Can you just give us a little more, a little more detail around sort of the share gains and where the customers are? Thank you. \nChris O\u2019Herlihy: Yes, so I don\u2019t know about this distraction from consolidation. I can tell you we are not distracted and we are basically focused on trying to win the recovery here, serve the needs of our customers with innovate new products and so on. So generally I think we're seeing some real nice recovery in food faster than actually than we thought at the beginning of the year. We are certainly seeing the benefit of staying invested in food.  Even obviously on price cost, in fact there\u2019s some uncertainly, but obviously that\u2019s \u2013 some of that relates to the fact that the price cost environment, some of these are pricing actions here in the second half.  We\u2019re concerned about the end markets. I mean basically with food, we are back to about \u2013 by the end of this year we expected back over 90% of the 2019 number, so faster than we though. And in terms of end markets, we are seeing a nice pickup in instructional, restaurants coming back, we mentioned restaurants being up 60%.  In terms of stuff that\u2019s coming back a little slower, I would say service if we point to serve in Europe as an example. Obviously with significantly lockdowns we are still dealing with over there, we\u2019ll probably come back a little slower there, but at least for the half. We think we\u2019ll see that pick up here in the second half, but generally most end markets are coming back. Lodging is a little slower I would say and transportation, right and airlines. \nScott Santi: Transportation, for sure.\nJoel Tiss: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back over to Karen. \nKaren Fletcher: Okay, thanks Adam. We appreciate you joining us this morning and if you have any follow-up questions, please let me know. Have a great day! \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Chris O'Herlihy",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide five, the table on the left provided some perspectives on the growth momentum in our businesses when we look at sequential revenue from Q1 to Q2.  I would expect the pace of recovery in our Auto OEM segment has been dampened by the well-publicized shortage of semi-conductor chips, despite very strong underlying demand, and for that reason we added a role to the table to show portfolio demand trends ex-auto. Our Q2 revenue ex-auto increased 8% versus Q1. This year Q2 had one more shipping date in Q1, so on an equal day basis our Q2 versus Q1 revenue growth and ex-auto is 6%, which is 2x of our normal Q2 versus Q1 seasonality of plus 3%. In addition, we added more than $200 million of backlog in Q2. Both of these factors show that demand accelerated meaningfully in Q2 across our portfolio.  Now let's go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with automotive OEM. Demand recovery versus prior year was most evident in this segment with 84% organic growth. This of course was against easy comps versus a year ago when most of our customers in North America and Western Europe were shut down from mid-March to mid-May. North America was up 102%, Europe was up 106% and China up 20%.  We estimate that the shortage of semiconductor chips negatively impacted our sales by about $60 million in the quarter. Operating margin of 18.8% was up 26.6 percentage points on volume leverage and enterprise initiatives. Price cost was a significant headwind of more than 200 basis points due to the long recycle time required to implement price recovery actions in this segment.  Given the ongoing semiconductor chip supply uncertainty, we now expect full year organic growth in automotive to be approximate 10% versus our original range of 14% to 18% at the beginning of the year. To be clear, this is not lost revenue, but simply delayed into next year. Furthermore, the slower than expected growth in auto is offset by strength elsewhere in the enterprise.  Please turn to slide six for Food Equipment. In Food Equipment organic revenue rebounded 46% with recovery taking hold across the board and the backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. North America was up 39% with equipment up 42% and service up 33%. Institutional revenue was up more than 30% with health care and education growth in the low to mid-30s and lodging up in the mid-20s. Restaurants were up about 60% with the largest year-over-year increases in Food Service and QSR.  Retail grew in the mid-teens and continued solid demand and new product rollouts. International recovery was also robust at 58% with Europe up 66% and Asia Pacific up 29%. Equipment sales were strong 66%, with service growth of 39%, which continued to be impacted by extended lockdowns in Europe. Operating margin was 22% with an incremental of 46%.  Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue of $606 million was a Q2 record with organic growth of 29%. Test & Measurement was up 20%, driven by solid recovery in customer CapEx spend and continued strength in semicon. Electronics grew 38%, continued strength in consumer electronics and automotive applications, and the added benefit in timing of some large equipment orders in Electronic Assembly. Operating margin of 28.1% was 240 basis points \u2013 was up 240 basis points and a Q2 record.  Moving to slide seven, welding growth was also strong in Q2 at 33%. Equipment Revenue was up 38%, and consumables growth of 25% was the time in positive territory since 2019. Our industrial business grew 52% on increased CapEx spending by our customers and the commercial business remained solid, up 26% following 17% growth in the first quarter. North America was up 38% and International growth was 13%, primarily driven by recovery in oil and gas.  Polymers & Fluids organic growth was 28%, led by our automotive aftermarket business up 33% on robust retail sales. Polymers were up 34% with continued momentum in MRO applications and heavy industries. Fluids is up 8% with North America growth in the mid-teens and European sales up low single digits. Operating margin was an all-time record of 27.3% with strong volume leverage and enterprise initiatives partially offset by price cost.  Moving to slide eight. Construction organic grew up to 28% reflected double digit growth and recovery in all three regions. North America was up 20% with 16% growth in residential renovation and with 26% growth in commercial construction.  Europe grew 61% with strong recovery versus easy comps in the UK and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand organic growth was 13% with continued strength in residential and commercial. Operating margin in the segment of 27.6% was up 390 basis points and was a Q2 record.  Specialty organic revenue was up 17% with North America up 15%, Europe up 24% and Asia Pacific up 14%. Our Flexible Packaging business was up mid-single digit against tougher comps than the rest of the segment. The majority of our businesses were up double digits, led by appliance up more than 50%. Consumable sales were up 19% and equipment sales up 12%.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott. We saw a significant pickup in the case of inflation in Q2, yeah. Well, price versus cost in auto is always going to be challenging given the, you know the nature of the industry. I would say in terms of incremental in the second quarter in auto we had a 47% incremental, an impact of 47% incremental you know for the first half of the year. So incrementals are strong in auto no double, but there is no doubt that the structure of the industry, the structure of the pricing agreements, it does take a lot longer. Hard to say how long it will take for us to catch up there with that. Yes, so we'll say the construction margins are very sustainable. We've been improving via the construction for a long time now and certainly for the last few quarters here we've been in the mid to high 20s in terms of margin and construction. So despite the price cost environment, we're seeing nice organic growth in construction. We are getting nice price realization and so we're then starting to expect the margins there to be sustainable.  Surely in Test and Measurement margins again you know currently in the high 20s here and have been like that for a long time. The segment that we like in terms of level of differentiation, I believe it's our customer problems. So we don't see any issue with sustaining margins in either Test & Measurement or Construction. Yeah, I mean, I think we are saying 100 plus, so we will do better than 100 this year. And there's still a lot of interest on our price initiatives bought on sourcing and in '20. You know these are all initiatives and activities that are very granular within out segments. Within each division there is a host of activity that we are working on. And actually have been working on not just this year, but even starting last year, so we entered the year with a fair bit of tailwind in terms of enterprise initiatives. So we would expect to do a 100 plus for sure. Yeah, it's the only thing I would say is just our, this cost comps, I think all over its going to be 18-24, because here it really creates a lot of the packages for us in terms of more sort of simplified and streamlined cost offerings. Obviously it results in simplification of raw materials and components and that simplification and focus also extends to our suppliers.  The key part of our strategy and its worked for us for many years is to have these you know very strong and long lasting supplier partnerships and we are a key customer for most of our raw material suppliers. This becomes really, really important when supply chains become constrained and releasing that work to our benefit here in the last 12 months. Yeah Joe, I mean the only reason it's getting worse in Q3 is because of the pace of inflation in Q2. We saw significant pick-up in pace in Q2 and obviously there's a little bit of a lag, so we see a little bit of a worsening in Q3 based on what we know today, based on the cost increases we see and the known price increases, we see a little worsening in Q3 from Q2, only on the base of the pace of inflation in Q2. So in terms of you know acceleration of organic growth, you know we're seeing it. Obviously we talked about all our work, it's going in a different way, but certainly in Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, electronics and welding you know are certainly growing faster than we expected earlier in the year, so we're seeing a nice acceleration there.  And you know we have no reason to believe that it's not sustainable based on our conversation with our customers, the order patterns and so on and you know obviously as we want to talk about the factor \u2013 it's already busy here in terms of this winged recovery initiative you know over the last 12 months and you know it is still kind of early to quantify this.  We're feeling pretty good about how we're positioned and we \u2013 as you know we're very intentionally remain fully staffed to serve our customers, protect the investments and people and in addition to the customer backed innovation and suite of excellent and certainly there's a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that would say that that is turning into share gains and if I ever just maybe highlight some, get the sort of examples and like sort of equipment where you know high level product availability, maintaining service level excellence as Scott talked about and being able to respond in supply where a competitor could not is enabling several share gain and incremental wins from competition in large chains, both in food service and food retail.  Another example might be in farmers [ph] influence, automotive aftermarket. Staying invested here we will sustain our sales and innovation focus, coupled with high service levels means we grew as I mentioned in the commentary, automotive aftermarket grew by 33% in the quarter and this is well above customer point sales growth indicating that we are getting share in a meaningful way. And in our measurements and construction in our roofing businesses, in association of 45% in the quarter, again we'd see very clearly we're gaining share there on competition who have certainly been supply chain and operationally constrained, extending delivery times and so on and we continue to maintain differentiated service levels. So again, somewhat anecdotal, somewhat early in the window recovery strategy, but certainly ample evidence that we seem to be regaining share, and these are just a small selection of illustrative examples of tech products that we're making across our seven segments. And the second part of your question is I think related to freight and logistics, is that correct? And so with freight and logistics, I mean obviously there's no impact for us, but I don't see a less of an impact than some of our peers maybe on the basis that the produce what we sell \u2013 the produce and so what we sell, the philosophy that we've long had that certainly mitigated the impact of freight and logistics on our cost structure and availability. It's really the pace that makes sense, we are in no rush here. That was the 1% we added to organic, yeah. Yeah, that's a fair assumption. But we are seeing a bottom out here and I think it will be a slow recovery, based on what we are seeing today, a slow recovery from here on out. Yes, so I don't know about this distraction from consolidation. I can tell you we are not distracted and we are basically focused on trying to win the recovery here, serve the needs of our customers with innovate new products and so on. So generally I think we're seeing some real nice recovery in food faster than actually than we thought at the beginning of the year. We are certainly seeing the benefit of staying invested in food.  Even obviously on price cost, in fact there's some uncertainly, but obviously that's \u2013 some of that relates to the fact that the price cost environment, some of these are pricing actions here in the second half.  We're concerned about the end markets. I mean basically with food, we are back to about \u2013 by the end of this year we expected back over 90% of the 2019 number, so faster than we though. And in terms of end markets, we are seeing a nice pickup in instructional, restaurants coming back, we mentioned restaurants being up 60%.  In terms of stuff that's coming back a little slower, I would say service if we point to serve in Europe as an example. Obviously with significantly lockdowns we are still dealing with over there, we'll probably come back a little slower there, but at least for the half. We think we'll see that pick up here in the second half, but generally most end markets are coming back. Lodging is a little slower I would say and transportation, right and airlines."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thank you, Karen, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results.  Revenue was up 43% with organic growth up 37%. We saw double digit growth in every segment and geography. Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the one-time tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.  In this strong demand environment and in the face of a very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits are staying fully staffed and invested through our win and recovery positioning, to continue providing world class service levels to our customers, while also continuing to execute on our long term strategy to achieve and sustain ITWs full potential performance.  We're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remain pretty much strong across the board, and during the second quarter we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses.  While there is no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years and ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers.  We worked hard over the last nine years the position ITW to deliver differentiated performance in any environment, and I have no doubt that the ITW team will continue to execute at a high level as we move to the balance of the year and beyond.  Now for some more detail on our performance in the second quarter. As I mentioned, organic growth was 37% with strong performance across our seven segments. The two segments that were hardest hit by the pandemic a year ago led the way this quarter with Automotive OEM up 84% and Food Equipment up 46%. By geography, North America was up 36% and International was up 38%, with Europe up 50% and Asia Pacific up 20%.  GAAP EPS of $2.45 was up 143% and included a one-time tax benefit of $0.35 related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there. Excluding this item, EPS of $2.10 grew 108%. It was a Q2 record and was 10% higher than in Q2 of 2019.  Operating income increased 99% and incremental margin was 40% at the Enterprise level. Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives. Year-to-date our teams have delivered robust margin expansion with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price cost impact.  Speaking of price cost, price cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points. While the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year. Consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar for dollar basis.  In Q2 we ended up just short of that goal due to some timing lags, and as a result net price cost impact reduced EPS by $0.001 in the quarter. We continue to expect price cost impact to be EPS neutral or better for the year, and I'll come back and provide more color on the price cost environment a little later in my remarks.  In the quarter after tax, return on invested capital was a record at 30.8%. Free cash flow was $477 million with a conversion of 72% of net income on adjusted for the one-time tax benefit I mentioned earlier. And that was due to the additional working capital investments necessary to support our strong organic growth.  We continue to expect approximately 100% conversion for the full year. We repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter as planned, and finally our tax rate in the quarter was 10.1% due to a one-time tax benefit. Excluding this item, our Q2 tax was 23%.  Now moving to slide four for an updated on price cost. We continue to experience raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And now project raw material cost inflation at around 7% for the full year, which is almost 5 percentage points higher than what we anticipated as the year began. And just for some perspective, this is roughly 2x of what we experienced in the 2018 inflation TerraCycle.  We learned a lot from that experience and as a result of the timeliness and pace of our price recovery actions, are well ahead of where we were in 2018. As I mentioned, we expect price cost impact to be EPS neutral or better for the full year, with pricing actions more than offsetting cost increases on a dollar for dollar basis.  Price costs will continue to have a negative impact on our operating margin percentage, however in the near term as we saw in Q2 the net impact will likely be modestly higher in Q3 versus Q2 before it starts to go the other way. For the full year we expect price cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.  That being said, margin benefits from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage will provide us with ample ability to offset the negative affect of price cost and margin percentage, and deliver strong overall margin performance for the year. And beyond the near term price cost impact, we remain confident that we have meaningful additional structural margin improvement potential from the ongoing execution of our enterprise initiatives.  With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for some comments on our segment performance in Q2. Chris. Thanks Chris. Let's move on to slide nine for an update on our full year 2021 guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $14.3 billion to $14.6 billion, up 15% at the midpoint versus last year, with organic growth in the range of 11% to 13% and foreign currency translation impact of plus-3%.  This is an increase in organic growth of one percentage point at the mid-point versus the updated guidance that we provided at the end of Q1, driven largely by the incremental revenue impact of pricing actions implemented in Q2 in response to accelerating raw material cost increases.  While demand momentum accelerated in Q2 versus Q1 as we noted earlier in our presentation, we are admittedly being conservative in not projecting that forward in our guidance at this point in time, given the significant supply chain disruptions that continue to challenge many of our customers in auto and otherwise.  We are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.35 to a range of $8.55 to $8.95 to incorporate the one-time tax benefit realized in the second quarter. The mid-point of 875 represents earnings growth of 32% versus last year and 13% over 2019. Factoring out the one-time Q2 tax side in the mid-point of our 2021 guidance is 10% higher than 2019.  With regard to margin percentage as discussed earlier, the incremental cost increases that we saw in Q2 will result in full year margin dilution of 100 basis points versus the 50 basis points that we project [Audio Gap] to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which would still be an improvement of more than 200 basis points year-over-year and an all-time record for the company. And again, we expect zero EPS impact from price cost for the full year.  We expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 100% of net income factoring out the impact of the one-time, non-cash, tax benefit we recorded in Q2. Through the first half we have repurchase 500 million of our shares and expect to repurchase an additional 500 million in the second half. Finally we expect our tax rate in the second half to be in our usual range of 23% to 24% and for our full year tax rate of around 20%.  Lastly, today's guidance excludes any impact from the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, which we expect to close later this year. Once that acquisition closes we'll provide you with an update.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to you Karen. Thank you. He's on short term IR, but he'll be back next week. Well, on the first question I think we're very confident that we will cover whatever, you know all the increases that have already been incurred and anything subsequent to that, I would not be comfortable describing the environment as stabilizing at this point, but ultimately I think we have demonstrated. We've looked back over the last \u2013 you know going back to 2017 and even in \u201818 and certainly this year, you know sort of on a quarterly basis worst impacts on price costs and inflationary environments have been a $0.001, you know may be $0.02 one quarter.  So I think we're fully comfortable that we'll be able to read and react to whatever might happen from here that the EPS impact of the company will be negligible for the full year, but I think as I said, I don't \u2013 it's not based on an assumption that things are going to stabilize from here for sure. I don't think we're seeing \u2013 we've seen enough evidence of that and normally I'd predict things are going to continue to reach forward either. I think its wait and see. I was going to add some color commentary that I think I was adding up the time when Chris was reading the comments, but I think we said all time record margins for Q2 and Q3 of our seven segments despite the price cost environment. And I'll just circle back to a comment I made, which is you know there is still room to run in terms of structural margin improvement across the company. We got 150 basis points of enterprise initiative benefit in this quarter. So there is, you know these are certainly sustainable improvements and performance and we expect to continue to do better as we go forward. Well, I don't know. You know the headwind from my perspective is a percentage headwind, it's not an earnings headwind. You know the overall position that we wanted, we've created an incredibly profitable economic engine and the most important job we have is to grow it organically, and so from the standpoint of \u2013 to the extent we don't have to go up as high as other people do, we are leveraging that strong position and we can translate that into incremental share, that's the preferred option.  I don't want our people fighting over the next incremental. We ought to get the cost for sure, but then let's get on to talk with our customers about how we can help them improve their business you know operationally, technically from a sales standpoint and so that's basically it. We can certainly do more to get all distraction and try to price optimize in the short term, but I don't think that services our long term interest very well. We make plenty money, you know this is not a... I'll give you some overall color and then certainly let Chris giving some segment level, sort of business levels specifics if some things come to mind for him.  I would say, in terms of overall color, as we talked to our businesses around the world, there's no question that it is a daily battle that maintained supplier division as we service our customers. I would absolutely contend that we are doing better than most for a couple of reasons: One is the fact that we have long head, localized supply relationships with local manufacturing facilities, serving our customers locally. And then the other fact is what I \u2013 we talked about in our remarks, the fact that we kept all our people though the pandemic. We have not to scramble to bring people back.  So normally our supply chain manufacturing operations function in a very simple automated way. It's definitely taking a lot more, let's call it boot force for now, but I think we are not hearing any big issues from a standpoint of our own ability to supply our customers. It doesn't mean that there's not an occasional you know $2 bracket that shows up late and there is a couple of other machines that can't go on just making that out, but that's \u2013 I'm sure that's the case, but ultimately given the service level that we are now entering, you know as a standard part of our operating practices I would say that \u2013 I'm very comfortable saying that we are working a lot harder than we normally have to, but ultimately performing pretty well.  I would say that the supply chain area beyond auto is much more of an issue for us on the demand side than the supply side and I'd point to a couple of things, but we are seeing a lot of sort of timing changes in terms of orders and requirements, not because we can't deliver something, but because another supplier can deliver something to a customer. And I'd also points to the $200 million of backlog, and we've talked about this before.  You know we should \u2013 basically today is what our customers ordered yesterday and so we operate with very little backlog and the fact that we built a couple of hundred million of backlog, I can't analyze every dollar of it, but my contention would be that that's a lot more to do the \u2013 for the customer delays than it is our own ability to supply.  And with that we'll see the $60 million in auto plus the $200 million in backlog, that's another 10 percentage points of organic growth in the second quarter. You know again, I'm not necessarily contending that all of it could have gone, but my bet would be most of it and that's the only thing... [Cross Talk] Well, I would tell you that we are excited about MPS. We are working hard to get that one finished off and you know that is what's kind of $50 million of annualized revenue, so that's you know certainly enough work to do for a little while anyway. I don't want to unnecessarily comment on the pipeline as much as to say we remain and will remain very interested in adding high quality businesses to the company, but so the timing of all that is always a subject of the quality of what opportunities present themselves.  So there's a lot of stuff going on, but it's not a matter of how big or small the pipeline is; it's more we're looking for a much narrower set of criteria than I think, so it's more a function of the quality of what's there than the quantity. I'd say some of it is to convert. I think the only one you know that's probably you know definitely into 2022 is the loan that Chris mentioned and not where this, you know this dip sort of doesn't look like it's going to get resolved any time soon. But I'd say most of the \u2013 the rest of that backlog, that $200 million, I would expect that to \u2013 given our customers can take it, because they can get the other components of things they need, that should certainly convert in the back half.  I think our \u2013 you know it just doesn't make sense to up the revenue guide when you know everyone is so supply constrained right now. That I can't say it any more simply than that and that's how we see how things play out. It just doesn't make sense to take things too far from where they are now in terms of run rate until we see how that all \u2013 how the supply issues play out in affecting our customers willingness to, you know the ability to take what they've ordered from us and with more. But I would say it is definitely you know from simpler border rates and the overall demand is definitely enough there to do you know well better than what's in our guide is this pricing situation. It's you know significantly better from here forward. Thanks Nigel. But beyond that I don't think there's anything that really concentrates up. You know I think again the color from our businesses, you know it's something different every day, but you know it's not a \u2013 you now it takes a lot more work and it's not even the big dollar stuff. It's again the $2 bracket, but it is a real offer right now, significantly more than... [Cross Talk] Spot purchases, if you can explain that a little more Chris. It's his to tell. [Cross Talk] It's probably a three to five years process, and part of that is not disrupting the business. Thank you. For the year? Yeah, it's 1%. It's the former not the latter, if I understand you correctly. Taking a risk for us by far is customer supply chain, and what that does to their demand patterns from here on out.  It is \u2013 as I said before, it's about as volatile of a situation as I've seen in my career at ITW, and so I don't \u2013 I'm not trying to be mysterious about it. I think until we see that start to stabilize, it's just really hard to be comfortable sort of raising \u2013 I know we are serving the demand we have today really well and sort of run rate from the standpoint that our customers are able to sustain, and I think we are comfortable continuing to \u2013 our ability to do that will continue on for the back half.  There is a lot more orders and a lot more demand and that's again why we built backlog, that's \u2013 there is not a demand question. If we had, we \u2013 our customers had sort of unimpaired supply chains right now, we would have probably had 10 more points in the second quarter on this. It's not a fact, that's just my opinion.  But you know just looking at the backlog, and so I think demand is certainly much stronger right now given the pace of the recovery, it's just the matter off from the standpoint of all the supply chain issues and the risks for our customers. Their pace of being able to \u2013 you know what they ultimately need from us. As I said it's just hard to justify going up with a lot of confidence from here, but it's more their supply side than their demand side, if that makes sense. We are not thinking about \u201822 much yet, but I would just you know say as a general rule, a lot of the supply chain disruption I think just pushes, adds to the duration of the recovery. I think there is plenty of business now, and because all of it can't be satisfied, a point of demand now and Chris will gave an example of auto.  This $60 million we couldn't ship in audio in the second quarter, that's not going away, that's just getting pushed out. We got dealer inventories at all-time lows, you know I forget what it was, less than a month, maybe less than a month I think I saw you know and so to the extent, I don't think it's necessarily the worst thing in the world that all this demand that's there right now can't be fully serviced, because it's going to allow us to \u2013 again this recovery duration gets extended by another two to four quarters maybe. We'll think harder about that as we get to that part of the year. Yes. I think the best way to model our working capital requirements is our months on-hand and days sales outstanding. Sort of we managed the metrics on those. Generally speaking months on hand runs roughly 2.5 months, DSO I can't remember off the top of my head, but whatever the average is, 60-ish maybe, so that's where [inaudible] going to go.  Sales go up, month on hand is not going to go up, but the dollars invested, so today we stated that month on hand id going to go up. The same with receivables in terms of DSO. So it's not a \u2013 it's something that happens automatically. We don't have to sort of force that to happen, but as sales go up, inventory is going to go up and the month on hand is a function of that's how 80/20 works. There is some element of it, that give us you know we want X amount of inventory to be able to product the ability to react and respond to our customers, you know order today shipped tomorrow kind of system.  So I think that's the best guidance I can give you on working capital. It's just not let through and whether that's cash flow, it's not going to be \u2013 you know when you are jumping up as much as we did in Q2, where Q1 is going to obviously require some incremental working capital.  And then the other question, I'm sorry, I'm trying to do my best Michael impersonation here as I can, so I'm trying to think hard. So CapEx, I think the plan for the year was up like $300 million or so. Yeah, for the year. So there is no incremental CapEx. We did differ some incremental capacity investments last year because of the pandemic, we didn't need them. Those are certainly all coming back on, but those are \u2013 you know we operate with another element of 80/20 as we want to be front end loaded on capacity, that's how we serve our customers. So as business continues to go forward, we will continue to invest and stay in that sort of increment, you know meaningful increment ahead of current demand, but that wouldn't be again something out of the normal of what we always do and it wouldn't be some big sort of lump coming through. You must remember prior peak margins in auto, because it was probably 23 maybe. And so, there is still lot of item recovery to go in auto from where we were then and so I'd say low to mid-20s is certainly achievable over time. Sure. Now you know where the [inaudible] of the group is. Transportation, for sure."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Christie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to ITW\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s first quarter financial results and update our guidance for full-year 2021. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains Forward-Looking Statements. We refer you to the Company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thanks, Karen. Good morning, everyone. In Q1, we saw continued improvement in both the breadth and pace of the recovery, with six of our seven segments delivering strong growth in the quarter, with revenue increases at the segment level ranging from 6% to 13%, and that is with one less shipping day in Q1 of this year versus last year. At the enterprise level, organic growth was plus 6% in Q1 or plus 8% on an equal days basis, and that was despite the fact that our Food Equipment segment was still down 10% in the quarter. The fundamental strength of our 80/20 front-to-back business system and the skill and dedication of our people around the world, combined with the Win the Recovery actions that we initiated over the course of the past year allowed us to meet our customers\u2019 increasing needs while at the same time delivering strong profitability leverage, as evidenced by our 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental margins and 120 basis points of margin benefits from our enterprise initiatives in the quarter. Despite rising raw material costs and a tight supply chain environment, we maintained our world-class service levels to our customers while also establishing several all-time Q1 performance records for the company, including earnings per share of $2.11, operating income of $905 million at an operating margin of 25.5%. Based on our first quarter results and our normal practice of projecting current demand rates through the balance of the year, we are adjusting our 2021 guidance. For the full-year, we now expect organic growth of 10% to 12%, operating margin in the range of 25% to 26% and EPS of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, which at the $8.40 midpoint represents 27% earnings growth versus last year. At the midpoint of our revised guidance, 2021 full-year revenues would be up 1% versus 2019 and EPS would be up 9%. Now stating the obvious, there is still a lot of ground to cover between now and the end of the year, and the near-term environment is certainly not without its challenges. That being said, I have no doubt that we are well positioned to respond to whatever comes our way as we move through the remainder of the year and to continue to deliver differentiated performance in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael.\nMichael Larsen: Alright. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world responded to our customers\u2019 increasing needs, as they always do, and delivered revenue growth of 10%. Organic growth of 6% was the highest organic growth rate for ITW in almost 10-years. And as Scott mentioned, Q1 had one less day this year. And on an equal days basis, organic revenue grew 8%. Organic growth was positive across all major geographies, with China leading the way with 62%, North America was up 4% and Europe grew 1%. Relative to Q4, the new trend that emerged in Q1 was a meaningful pickup in demand in our CapEx-driven equipment businesses, Test & Measurement and Electronics, which grew 11%; and Welding, which grew 6%. GAAP EPS of 2.11 was up 19% and an all-time EPS record for continuing operations. Operating leverage was a real highlight this quarter with incremental margins of 45% as operating income grew 19% year-over-year. Operating margins improved to 25.5% in the quarter, an increase of almost 200 basis points as a result of volume leverage and a continued strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives, partially offset by the margin impact of price cost. Excluding the third quarter of 2017, which had the benefit of a onetime legal settlement, operating margin of 25.5% was our highest quarterly margin performance ever. As you know, supply chains around the world are under significant pressure, and ITW\u2019s operating teams certainly had to deal with their fair share of supply challenges and disruptions in the quarter. By leveraging our produce where we sell supply chain strategy, our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back business system and supported by the fact that we were fully staffed for this uptick in demand due to our window recovery initiative, we were able to maintain our normal service levels to our customers. And once again, our ability to deal with the impact of some pretty meaningful supply chain challenges and disruptions and still take care of our customers, with strong levels of profitability, speaks to the quality of the execution at ITW. In the quarter, we experienced raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And across the company, our operating teams have already initiated pricing plans and actions that will offset all incurred as well as known but not yet incurred raw material cost increases on a dollar per dollar basis, as per our usual process. As a result, price cost is expected to be EPS-neutral for the year. As you know, given our high-margin profile, offsetting cost increases with price on a dollar per dollar basis causes some modest dilution of our operating margin percentage and our incremental margin percentage in the near-term. In Q1, for example, our operating margin was impacted 60 basis points due to price costs. And our incremental margin would actually have been 52%, not 45%, if it wasn\u2019t for this impact from price costs. For the balance of the year and embedded in our guidance are all known raw material increases and the corresponding pricing actions that have either already been implemented or will be. Again, EPS-neutral for the full-year. At this early stage in the recovery, our 25.5% operating margins are already exceeding our pre-COVID operating margins. Four of the seven segments delivered operating margin of around 28% or better in Q1, with one segment, welding, above 30% in a quarter for the first time ever. I think it says a lot of our operating teams, that when faced with the challenges of the global pandemic, they stayed focused on our long-term enterprise strategy and continue to make progress towards our long-term margin performance goal of 28% plus. After-tax return on capital was a record 32.1%. And free cash flow was solid at $541 million with a conversion of 81% of net income, in line with typical seasonality for Q1. We continue to expect 100% plus conversion for the full-year. As planned, we repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter, and the effective tax rate was 22.4%, slightly below prior year. So in summary, the first quarter was solid for ITW with broad-based organic growth of 6%, strong profitability leverage, 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental profitability and record operating margin and EPS performance. So please turn to Slide 4 for the segment performance. And the information on the left side of the page summarizes the organic revenue growth rate versus prior year by segment for Q1 this year compared to Q4 last year. And it illustrates the broad-based demand recovery that we are seeing in our businesses. And obviously, there is a positive impact as the easier comparisons begin on a year-over-year basis. With the exception of Automotive OEM, every segment had a higher organic growth rate in Q1 than they did in Q4, and six of our seven segments delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, with double-digit growth in Construction Products, and Test & Measurement and Electronics, which were also the most improved segments in this sequential view, going from down 3% in Q4 to up 11% in Q1. Welding improved eight percentage points, growing 6% in Q1, providing further evidence that the industrial CapEx recovery is beginning to take hold as visibility and confidence is coming back. At the enterprise level, ITW\u2019s organic growth rate went from down 1% in Q4 to up 6%. And I would just highlight that this is 6% organic growth with one of our segments, Food Equipment, while on its way to recovery is still down 10% year-over-year. As we go through the segment slides, you will see that this robust organic growth, combined with strong enterprise initiative impact, contributed to some pretty strong operating margin performance in our segments. So let\u2019s go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with our Automotive OEM. And the demand recovery in the fourth quarter continued this quarter with organic growth of 8% and total revenue growth of 13%. North America revenue was down 2% as customers continue to adjust their production schedules in response to the well-publicized shortage of certain components, including semiconductor chips. We estimate this impacted our Q1 sales by about $25 million, and it is likely to continue to impact our revenues to the tune of about $50 million in Q2 and another $50 million in the second half of the year. As you can appreciate, the situation is obviously pretty fluid, but as we sit here today, that is our best estimate, and that is also what we embedded in our updated guidance. Looking past the near-term supply chain issues affecting the auto industry, we are pretty optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects as consumer demand remains strong and dealer inventories are very low by historical standards. By region, North America being down in Q1 was more than offset by Europe, which was up 4%, and China up 58%. And finally, the team delivered solid operating margin performance of 24.1%, an improvement of 320 basis points. Please turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment. So revenue was down 7%, with organic revenue down 10%, but like I said, much improved versus Q4. And there are solid signs that demand is beginning to recover, as evidenced by orders picking up and a backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. Overall, North America was down 6%, with equipment down only 1% as compared to a 22% decline in Q4. Institutional, which represents about 35% of our North American equipment business was down 7%, with healthcare about flat and education is still down about 10%. Restaurants, which represents 25% of our equipment business, was down in the mid-teens, with full-service restaurants down about 30%, but fast casual up low single digits. Retail, which is now 25% of the business, was up more than 20% as a result of strong demand and new product rollouts. International was down 15% and is really a tale of two regions. As you would expect, Europe was down 22% due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific was up 44%, with China up 99%. Overall equipment sales were down 4% and service down 19%. Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered revenue growth of 14% with 11% organic growth. Test & Measurement was up 7% with continued strength in semiconductors and healthcare end markets now supplemented by strengthening demand in the capital equipment businesses as evidenced by the Instron business growing 12%. The electronics business grew 16%, with strong demand for team room technology products, automotive applications and consumer electronics. Operating margin of 28.4% was up 330 basis points. Moving to Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong sequential improvement in Welding as the segment delivered organic growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in almost three-years. The commercial business, which serves smaller businesses and individual users, usually leads the way in a recovery, and Q1 was their third quarter in a row with double-digit growth, up 17% this quarter. The industrial business continued its sequential improvement trend and was down only 1% with customer CapEx spend picking up and backlogs building. Overall, equipment sales were up 10% and consumables were flat versus prior year. North America was up 7%. And international growth of 4% was primarily driven by recovery in China and some early signs of demand picking up in oil and gas. Solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives contributed to a record margin performance of 30.3%, which, as I said, marked the first time an ITW segment delivered operating margins above 30%. Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 9%, with polymers up 16%, driven by strength in MRO applications particularly for heavy industries. The automotive aftermarket business continued to benefit from strong retail sales with organic growth of 9%, while fluids, which has a larger presence in Europe was down 1%. Operating margin benefited from solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives to deliver margins of 25.7%. Moving to Slide 7. Construction was the fastest-growing segment this quarter with organic growth of 13%. North America was up 12%, with continued strong demand in residential renovation and in the home center channel. Commercial construction, which is only about 15% of our U.S. sales, was up 3%. European sales grew 19% with double-digit growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand grew 7%, with strength in both residential and commercial markets. Operating margin of 27.6% was an improvement of 420 basis points. Specialty revenues were up 10% with organic revenue of 7% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 6%; Europe, up 5%; and Asia Pacific was up 24%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid at 6%. So please turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full-year 2021 guidance. And per our usual process, and with the caveat that we are only one quarter into the New Year and a significant number of uncertainties and challenges are still in front of us, we are raising our guidance on all key performance metrics, including organic growth, operating margin and EPS. In doing so, we have obviously factored in our solid Q1 results. And per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand exit in Q1, into the future and addressing them for typical seasonality. And as discussed, we have made an allowance for the estimated impact of semiconductor chip shortages on our Auto OEM customers. The outcome of that exercise is an organic growth forecast of 10% to 12% at the enterprise level. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 7% to 10%. Foreign currency at today\u2019s exchange rates adds two percentage points to revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 12% to 14%. As you saw, we are off to a strong start on operating leverage and enterprise initiatives, and we are raising our operating margin guidance by 100 basis points to a new range of 25% to 26%, which incorporates all known raw material cost increases and the corresponding pricing actions. Relative to 2020, our 2021 operating margins of 25% to 26% are 250 basis points higher at the midpoint and they are almost 150 basis points higher than our pre-COVID 2019 operating margins of 24.1% as we continue to make progress towards our long-term performance goal of 28% plus, as I mentioned earlier. Our incremental margins for the full-year are expected to be above our typical 35% to 40% range. Finally, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.60 and or 8% to a new range of $8.20 to $8.60. The new midpoint of $8.40 represents an earnings growth rate of 27% versus prior year and a 9% increase relative to pre-COVID 2019 EPS of $7.74. A few final housekeeping items to wrap it up, with no changes to: one, the forecast for free cash flow; two, our plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our own shares; and three, our expected tax rate of 23% to 24%. As per usual process, our guidance is for the core business only and excludes the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business. The process to close the acquisition by mid-year remains on-track. And once the acquisition closes, we will provide an update. As we have said before, we do not expect a material financial impact to earnings in 2021. So in summary, a quarter of quality execution in a challenging environment, and as a result, we are off to a solid start to the year. So with that, Karen, I will turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Michael. Christie, let\u2019s open up the lines for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Hi congratulations on a nice quarter. Two questions obviously, the organic growth that you saw in the quarter was fairly strong. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of it is sort of just end markets recovering versus sort of structural market share gains that ITW has been able to achieve? I guess that is my first question, if you can help us on that. And then my second question, the incrementals that you are putting up, the 45%, and then 52% if we adjust for price cost. This is above your targeted range with supply with COVID, costs and inefficiencies and things like that, I\u2019m just wondering if we should rethink, at some point, your targeted incrementals? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Okay, Jamie. So I think on the first one, it is a little too early to tell. I mean I think we certainly feel very good about how we are positioned with our Win the Recovery strategy and the fact that we stayed invested, giving us the ability to capture market share as we have talked about. So I think it is a little too early to tell how much of that growth in Q1 is really market versus market share gains. And I will just add to that, we have also seen an uptick from the contribution of our customer-back innovation efforts. And so again, that is a result of being able to stay invested in those. And then I would point to our supply chain and our ability to maintain our service levels, where maybe others are struggling a little bit more. So I think anecdotally, there are certainly lots of evidence, if you were to ask our divisions and our segments that we are picking up share. And again, we are going after sustainable, high-quality, profitable market share gains, not opportunistic. And so we feel really good about the start to the year on account of those things. I think on the incrementals, I agree with you, that was a real bright spot, significantly above our normal range of 35% to 40%. At these early stages in the recovery, we expect to be able to maintain the incrementals above the typical range. So 40% plus is what we are planning for and also embedded in our guidance, as you saw today. If you do the math, that is where you end up. I think it is a little premature to update kind of the long-term incremental margin expectations. I think we are comfortable with kind of long-term in the 35% to 40% range. We are certainly making a lot of improvement to the cost structure of the company. But let\u2019s revisit that at a later stage in terms of what we think the long-term incrementals might be on a go-forward basis. For now, if you think kind of beyond this year, I would still stick to the kind of the 35% to 40%.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you and congratulations.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Impressive. Scott, I was wondering if you could just update us on what you are thinking on M&A. Obviously, you got this MTS deal coming. I\u2019m sure you could have taken a shot on goal at well build if you wanted to get passed there. Maybe just how you see the pipeline kind of going out this year. And I understand these things are always kind of idiosyncratic and have their own timing. But do you see a likelihood that the pace of activity on M&A could be picking up for you over the next six to 12-months?\nScott Santi: Well, I think we are really happy with the MTS acquisition, that we have got some work to do, obviously, just to get it closed. All of it is basically standard, new team. But that is I think a great example of where I think acquisitions supplement our core growth focus, which is really owning great businesses that deliver great value to their customers and that we can grow organically. And MTS certainly adds and supplements our capabilities in terms of the Test & Measurement space and our ability to do so. I\u2019m not going to comment on your specific reference or any other deals that others have announced recently, but I would say that we - our appetite for additional MTS-light deals remains certainly strong. I can\u2019t remember exactly the term used, Jeff, but I think the phrase opportunistic is the right way to think about it. It is a combination of, ultimately, what we are interested in doing, what fits with the availability of assets that fit that profile. And that includes both their strategic attributes, the attributes that they offer in terms of our ability to improve their inherent financial performance and all at a value that we think makes sense for us and our shareholders and in terms of return on not just the capital, but the time, effort and energy that we are going to expend. So that is sort of the generic strategic narrative around it. My personal view is I absolutely think, on average, one to three MTS kinds of deals a year seems to be a reasonable - something that absolutely is achievable. We are not going to try to sort of force a deal every year on that. So some years are going to be zero because the circumstances are not going to present - the circumstances that we are looking for are not going to present themselves. But I think there is lots of room for other similar kinds of deals to be additive to what we are doing in a relatively consistent way over, let\u2019s say, the 5-year period. I think I will stop there.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thanks. I appreciate that. And also just wondering, outside of auto, which is kind of plain to see, Ford announcements and everything else. Are you seeing these sorts of - it sounds like your own supply chain, you are feeling pretty good about, but other things going on at customer levels that may cause top line disruption to you over the balance of the year?\nScott Santi: I think it is hard to project the balance of the year. I would say, for sure, in the second quarter, there are broader issues than just automotive at play. And I would also say that it is absolutely fair that we are having to work a lot harder in terms of securing our own sources of supply than we would under normal circumstances. So we have, for a number of reasons, I think, been able to counter punch our way through a much more challenging supply environment in the first quarter and through the second quarter, I think we are going to be able to do the same, broadly speaking, partly because we source local, that is - we know our suppliers. We source where we produce. And I think partly because of the fact that we stayed invested. We hang on to our people, so we are not having to add people back to support this uptick in demand. But I don\u2019t want to -- no one should take from that, that it is been smooth and easy the whole way through. So we are in it with everybody else and certainly having to work harder than normal to sustain our ability to supply. But I think so far, I feel like we have been able to, as I said, counter punch our way through it pretty well. And I would also say beyond the automotive space, there are certainly some pockets where we have some other - some of our customers being impacted by some of their own supply chain issues. Plastics remain tight in a number of areas. I don\u2019t think anything is sort of concentrated and significant as in auto, but it is certainly a scramble right now on a lot of levels.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes, understood. Thanks for the color, I appreciate it. Good luck.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hi good morning guys and Karen, I would echo Jeff\u2019s comments on exceptional numbers is going to become the usual here. Anyways, not a lot to pick on here. One of the comments you just made, Scott, on price or maybe it was Mike, price cost neutral, is that a comment that you would make across the entire portfolio, that segment by segment, you expect to be in a cost-neutral position this year or are there certain segments perhaps that take a little longer to get price or could be behind yes.\nMichael Larsen: I mean, I think the one obvious one, Scott, is the auto business, where just given the nature of the business and how the contracts are structured, getting price takes a little longer and requires a funnel of new products that are coming in at more attractive margins. So that is the one where, in the near-term, we are seeing the most significant pressure on margins from a price cost standpoint. And the other six segments, I think there is, given the differentiated nature of the products and services that we provide, we have a long history of being able to offset any cost increases with price. There is typically a little bit of a lag. I will tell you, we learned some things when we went through this in 2018. We are definitely much more, say, focused and on top of things earlier on. And our divisions are taking the actions that are required to kind of stay ahead of things this time around. So while there is certainly some pressure here, you saw 60 basis points of margin percentage impact and seven percentage points of incremental margin impact. The overall goal here is to offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and we are confident that we will be able to do that for the year and in total, even with the pressure and the difficulty in automotive.\nScott Davis: Okay, that is helpful. And just as a follow-up, I\u2019m just going to jump on the bandwagon of what Jeff was asking about on M&A. I would think that given the success you have had in kind of multiple different types of businesses, your assets, your confidence in going after a bigger asset and implementing 80/20 and really driving value perhaps way above what the - world could do or other strategic would perhaps widen that scope of ability to be able to do deals on the larger side. How do you guys think about that and applying 80/20 when you think about an M&A model?\nScott Santi: Yes. I don\u2019t think size is a barrier at all or a limitation or something that would scare us away. I would point to MTS as being - it is not quite $0.5 billion in annual revenue. So it is not a small business by any stretch. I would tell you a couple of things. One is that we have never been more prepared from the standpoint of discipline around integration, the quality of practice around our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, the depth of talent. This is all a result of the last nine-years of work on this. So all of that certainly is just additive to, I think, our ability to - if we find the right opportunity to do a really good job with it. So it is not an issue of - size doesn\u2019t scare us. I think sometimes what does happen is the larger the size, there tends to be it is a time to sort of a pure play. This is the part of the business. We want it all. The bigger the asset, the more sort of nonstrategic, non-desirable stuff you have to deal with sometimes. But that is also just sort of part of the tactics. But again, I don\u2019t think it is big or small that is the driving benefit to us as much as does it really fit with what we are good at, does it fit an area of the market we think has long-term above market organic growth prospects, et cetera. And whether it is large or relatively small, and by that I mean division size, those would be equally attractive options to us.\nScott Davis: Makes sense. Thank you Scott, good luck folks.\nScott Santi: You bet. Thanks.\nMichael Larsen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Scott and Michael, China, up 62% core. Have your factories and operations been able to keep up with that level of demand, which I get the premise of some compares, so it is not completely volume-driven, which presumably this is going to be up as much in the second quarter, just given it compares as well. Anything you would call out there? Because I understand the point that your factories are local and so forth, but that is a very high-growth rate. And I\u2019m just curious how kind of the quarter played out. And did you have to leave any sales on the table that maybe kind of get picked up later even?\nScott Santi: Yes. I actually probably can\u2019t answer that last piece other than to say that the business for us that is really of the biggest scale in China is auto. And they did a phenomenal job, if you look at the kind of volume. Now that is a big number year-on-year, but remember that China was way down in the first quarter last year. So from the standpoint of the sequential, I don\u2019t have that. I don\u2019t know, maybe you have, Michael, from Q4 to Q1, it wasn\u2019t a 58% jump, right. But I would say, overall, our decision to hang on to our people and just be ready for this has certainly given us an ability to respond. That if we were having to not only source scramble for raw material, but also scramble for people, it would certainly be a more difficult challenge than it was.\nJohn Inch: That is fair. I\u2019m curious, so we all know sort of the constraints around semicon and auto, Scott, you already talked about. I mean, I have sort of alluded to these questions in the past about the post-COVID world, demand is going to surge pretty aggres8sively. And I\u2019m curious, we have already started to see that, as evidenced by your own very healthy, robust results. Have your operations experienced any meaningful pinch points as global demand has come back that may have been surprising or that provides, per se, lessons learned, Scott, Michael, but you are applying as presumably, this is not a one or two quarter phenomenon. This is going to carry forward for a little while here. Is there anything you can share with us in terms of how you are thinking about sort of operations and just playing to the market share wins that sort of thing?\nScott Santi: Yes. I\u2019m trying to think about how to sort of tackle that one, John. Maybe the place to start is, inherent in our system is, we always talk about the fact that we produce today what our customers bought yesterday. So what makes that work is the fact that we are always carrying surplus capacity, on the order of magnitude of 15% to 20% over what current demand is. Because that demand comes, it is an average on a daily basis. So the only way we can produce today what our customers bought yesterday, as that number moves up and down, is to make sure that we have ample extra capacity to flex. So that sort of helps us as things accelerate, we do have a cushion to lean on. We also have - our supplier base is connected into that system in a way that they are also carrying that kind of ability to flex. Now it works really well. It doesn\u2019t work perfectly, certainly with - we have our sort of rubs and issues along the way, and I\u2019m sure we will. But there are things that we can overcome and work our way through. But maybe that is the best answer. I don\u2019t know if that totally addresses it, but we start with a sort of level of flex that certainly helps us respond and add even more capacity as we are pivoting into kind of an environment where the economy is starting to tick off.\nJohn Inch: Well, maybe an example, it is going to be Food Equipment. That seems obvious that that is going to come back pretty aggressively in the second half, touch wood. Is there anything you are doing with respect to your operations to make sure that you actually don\u2019t, say, lose share because -- or lose a sale because you can\u2019t fulfill a product demand or something like that?\nScott Santi: Yes, I\u2019m completely comfortable that they know exactly what to do. I mean, again, we have hung on to all of our people through this. We have hang on to all of our capacity. We are locked and loaded and ready to go. I have no doubt about it, into equipment, and everywhere else in the company.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Great, thank you very much.\nScott Santi: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.\nAnn Duignan: Ho g good morning everybody. Could you dig a little deeper into your comments around capital, like equipment demand picking up? I mean, I know you talked about it in places like Welding. But just a little bit more color by region, by application, by segment. Would just like to hear from you in terms of what specifically you are seeing, because that is a big change.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think, Ann, as you are saying, that was kind of the new trend that showed up here in the first quarter. We did see orders and backlog starting to build last year on the equipment side. But really in Q1 here, if you look at the businesses that had the most significant improvement relative to historical run rates, they are Test & Measurement, as I mentioned, and Welding. And so those are businesses that are more driven by investment in CapEx. And I think as the visibility to the recovery and the confidence in the recovery takes hold, our customers are placing orders for larger equipment. And we saw a little bit of that also in Specialty Products, on the packaging equipment side. And it is really a broad-based trend. So I don\u2019t really have the breakdown for you on a global basis, but really across the board, we saw really nice pickup in demand for the CapEx-driven products and those three businesses in particular. And I think we are off to a good start here in April. So I think we saw good momentum coming into Q1, kind of sustained that. March was a strong month. And April, everything is on-track here.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. I appreciate the color on that. And then just back to the whole maintaining your employee base and we see what a difference that makes this year. I mean, I don\u2019t think that, that should be understated given that almost every other company we cover mentioned their inability to attract labor as an issue. So congratulations on that but what about your customers? I mean, is there any risk that your customers have to defer orders? I mean, it is kind of counter to what you just talked about. But if your employers like the restaurants, for example, if they cannot hire, is there any risk that they will have to defer orders as we go through the year just because they can\u2019t get labor?\nScott Santi: Yes. I would be pretty certain it is going to have some impact in terms of the overall pace of the recovery in a number of areas. My personal view, Ann, is that is maybe not even such a bad thing in terms of extending the duration of the recovery and sort of managing the pace a little bit in the short run. So even with this auto, auto is a real extreme example of that, not so much on labor, but from semiconductor chips. Michael talked about the fact that consumer demand for autos is strong. Dealer inventories are at, I think, around the world, historic lows. So the fact that all of that is not trying to be satisfied in two quarters and it actually gets spread out, and so I just use that same analogy in places like Food Equipment, as I don\u2019t think it is necessarily a terrible thing that there are some limitations, either labor or other things, as we move through the recovery in some of our sectors. It doesn\u2019t mean demand isn\u2019t going to grow. It is not going to be this feeding frenzy of satisfying in a relatively short period of time. I don\u2019t know exactly how it is all going to play out, but I don\u2019t think some of those limitations in the near-term are necessarily bad things for the long haul, if that makes sense.\nAnn Duignan: Yes. No, I completely agree with you. It is kind of a forced rationalization of the industry. So yes, I appreciate the color. I will get back in line. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Scott or Michael, you mentioned Welding margin now above 30%, which I think is a new record for you. And as you know, Welding isn\u2019t close to fully recovered yet. If I go back to 2018, your margin at similar levels of revenue was approximately 28%. So if we step back and try to ingest that improvement, understanding that we haven\u2019t changed the long-term 28% target for the company over the last couple of years, but does it give you confidence that maybe the whole company can even do better than that over time?\nMichael Larsen: Andy, the easy answer to your question is, with the types of incrementals that our segments are putting up - the enterprise level is 45, welding was also 45, the answer is that margins will continue to improve just from the volume leverage alone. And then we know that there is still a ways to go to reach our full potential from an 80/20 front-to-back implementation standpoint as well. You see these enterprise initiatives continue to come in at 120 basis points at the enterprise level. Maybe a little bit less than that in Welding, but still a significant contribution from the initiatives. And so I have said this many times, and I will continue to say this. I mean, and then it is based on the bottoms-up planning that we do. We expect that all of our segments will continue to improve their operating margin performance, like I said, as demand recovers. And maybe more importantly, we still have a lot of things within our own control here that regardless of what happens from a demand standpoint, we can continue to improve the margin performance...\nScott Santi: While they grew at an accelerated rate organically.\nMichael Larsen: While growing...\nScott Santi: That is the yin and the yang of the...\nMichael Larsen: That is right. That is right. We can do both, right. And then what I said in my comments is what is really encouraging, I think, is that with everything going on last year and right now, with supply chain as well, the fact that our teams leverage this Win the Recovery strategy, stayed focused on executing a long-term enterprise strategy, and we are sitting here really you could argue one quarter into the recovery, and we have a clear path in front of us as we continue to make progress towards our 28%. You said 28%. I thought my comments I may have said 28% plus. That we continue to make progress towards our long-term margin goal of 28% plus.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful, guys. And then we talked a little bit about Food Equipment on the call already, but maybe just focusing on it. Obviously, reopening is happening faster, at least in the U.S. now. And you do have this large institutional business that could benefit from significant stimulus that already has been passed, especially for school cafeterias. So have you seen any of that money start to flow to that business or have you seen accelerating improvement in your restaurant business yet?\nMichael Larsen: Not yet is the answer. I mean, like I mentioned, we are starting to see a pickup in orders and backlog. As you know, these businesses are not really backlog-driven. But the quoting activity is solid, and it is reasonable to assume that there will be a pickup on the institutional side as we move forward, including for schools. So I think that is part of what is encouraging is we are not firing on all cylinders yet. We put up some pretty good results here in Q1 and we still have Food Equipment, as you mentioned, down 10% organic, with a strong recovery ahead of it. So I think that is really encouraging.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thank guys, I appreciate it.\nMichael Larsen: Welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Can we talk a little bit about, just returning to the issue of price cost. I know you guys said that it is a 60 basis points impact on margins in the first quarter. If we look at the full-year, how does that kind of flow from here? Maybe what is embedded for price cost headwinds in the full-year margin guidance?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So let me start by saying I would be a little cautious on Q2. There is a little bit of a timing issue here. And just given how high our margins are, I think these price cost pressures will remain with us, particularly in the near-term. So Q2, this will be dilutive to margin percentage, again, EPS-neutral on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So it is purely a margin percentage, incremental percentage impact. So 60 basis points in Q2 -in Q1. Something around that same level, maybe a little worse than that in Q2, based on what we know today. And then it should begin to improve in the second half of the year. And maybe for the full-year, we end up somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points of margin impact.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. Understood. And the selling days impact that you guys had in the first quarter, does that normalize throughout the year, like I think a lot of companies have talked about the selling days impact reversing in 4Q. Is that how it is for ITW as well?\nMichael Larsen: It is not, no. we have 64-days in Q2 and Q3 and 52-days in Q4, which is the same as we had last year. So this was purely a Q1 issue. If you remember, last year was a leap year. So I hate bringing this up. That is how the calendar works.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Thanks guys. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird.\nMircea Dobre: Thank you and congrats on a really strong start to the year. I guess my question, Michael, maybe for you. I was observing that SG&A has been relatively flattish year-over-year on really nice, strong revenue growth in Q1. And I\u2019m just sort of wondering here kind of how you constructed your outlook for the full-year, because you are obviously guiding for your revenues now above pre-COVID levels, above 2019 levels. I\u2019m sort of wondering if it is fair for us to sort of expect that SG&A is going to remain relatively muted or are you essentially kind of baking in a return to more normalized, call it, pre-COVID levels? And I\u2019m talking about the full-year run rate here.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So I would say, Mig, I mean, I would expect somewhere around - as our sales grow, obviously, the cost to support those sales, including things like commissions, are going to grow. And those costs are pretty correlated. And I think the last time I looked at it here a few days ago, I would assume something around 17% of sales in SG&A. And so that is maybe from a modeling standpoint, the way to look at it. I would just point to the fact, I mean, what we talked about earlier, the fact that we didn\u2019t have lots of people leave the company last year, and now we are hiring and a ton of costs are coming back in. That is not what I\u2019m talking about here. These are simply primarily sales commissions and costs like that, that are going to grow in line with - as the top line of the company grows this year in the low teens. So that is what you would expect to see.\nMircea Dobre: Got it. That is helpful. So around 17. I mean, that is basically going to be a bit higher than what you have done in Q1. That is probably the volume ramp that you are sort of talking about as the year progresses?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean I think the one thing I know for sure is that there is going to be a big ramp-up here in Q2.\nMircea Dobre: Right. And then my follow-up, and folks have been asking about the Food Equipment business, and I will, too, but I guess I will ask it this way. If I look at your business, it seems to me that this vertical, this segment is really the one that is probably been transformed the most by COVID In terms of sort of the end customers having to operate differently, having to think about doing business differently. And I\u2019m sort of wondering where that leads you strategically longer term, right? Because the industry is consolidating, you obviously have an important market position and really good product. How do you think about the next five-years from an innovation standpoint, from ability to gain share and, more importantly, you sort of stepping up to the plate and consolidating the industry as well because there are a lot of smaller players that are still out there.\nScott Santi: Yes. Well, I would be happy to try to address some of that. Let me start at the end of your question first. We are not interested in consolidation. We are not an economy scale company. We are not going to buy anything to consolidate. We are going to own great businesses that deliver value for their customers through the performance of the products and services that they offer. And so whether the industry consolidates or not, ultimately, we compete based on our ability to deliver superior value to the customers that we choose to target in those industries. And so that is essentially all I will say our businesses are very well positioned in this space. We expect that they will continue to grow at an accelerated rate with best-in-class margins and returns in that industry. And absolutely, to your point, we will have to continue to evolve and innovate as our customers evolve and innovate based on COVID or anything else in terms of what happens in that industry. And I think I will just leave it there.\nMircea Dobre: Alright. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.\nStephen Edward: Great. I just had one quick follow-up back on sort of your incremental margin discussion, Michael. If I remember correctly, I think the plan, obviously, dollar-for-dollar on price cost sort of in year one. But then as we move forward, I think the goal is to recover the margin on top of that. So why wouldn\u2019t we have a higher incremental margin in 2022 than kind of your base case?\nMichael Larsen: I think that is a good question. I think on price cost, I mean, what we are talking about right now is this pretty significant increase in raw material costs and offsetting those dollar-for-dollar with price. And in the near-term, as I said, that puts pressure on margins. I think once you get past the surge in raw material costs and those start to kind of stabilize or maybe even come down a little bit as expected, frankly, for some of these commodities in the back half of the year, you are holding on to the price and you are going to end up in a favorable position again from a price cost standpoint. That is kind of how this has played out historically. And historically, that is what is been embedded in that 35% to 40% incremental margin rate that we have been able to put up. I think once we go through - there is kind of the planning for 2022, I will give you a better feel for the ability to maintain incremental margins either above the historical range or in the historical range. But as we sit here today, like I said earlier, for modeling purposes, I would stick to the 35% to 40% for now. And we will give you an update as we go through the year here. But clearly, this year and in Q1 and in the near-term, really strong incremental margin performance. I don\u2019t know if I said this, but we are above the range of 35% to 40%, so 40% plus, and that is with price/cost for the full-year. Headwinds are somewhere around four to five percentage points to the incremental margin. So really strong performance here as the recovery takes hold.\nStephen Edward: Right. Yes. I certainly agree with that. It just seems like maybe you get that four or five percentage points back next year. But I will look forward to your update whenever you are ready.\nMichael Larsen: Okay. That is fair.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher: I just want to confirm that you have not baked in any cyclical increase in daily run rate of sales demand into your guidance. I imagine you are going to say you haven\u2019t. But just in an accelerating economic growth environment, it seems like your approach would be particularly conservative at this point.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think that is for you to decide. I think the argument you are making is not unreasonable. I think what we do is we give you kind of the outlook for the company at current run rates. And if you think that Food Equipment is going to come back stronger or you think the auto issue is a bigger issue, then you can certainly make those adjustments to your model. And as you know, ITW is this is a pretty predictable company certainly at the enterprise level. And so you can get pretty close to the models that we are looking at. And so we think this is the best way to communicate the outlook for the company and being very transparent. And then it is for you to decide kind of segment-by-segment how you think things might play out based on whatever data points that you look at.\nSteven Fisher: Fair enough, that is what I thought you would say. I just want to confirm. And then what have you assumed for divestitures and kind of approximate timing on that, if any new updates there.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So really no new update, I mean, as you recall, we put those on hold last year really to focus on the recovery here. And the most important thing we have to do is get the organic growth rate and demonstrate that we can grow consistently above market. The view was that working on divestitures is really a distraction from that. And by the way, we believe, and it is playing out that way, as these businesses are going to be more valuable when we kind of reinitiate the process, which will probably be somewhere at the end of this year, early next year. So from a strategic standpoint, these are still businesses that we are that are not a great fit for ITW, that are a much better fit, frankly, with other people, we think. And so that view has not changed, but we have kind of deferred all the activities to later this year or early next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a question perhaps for Michael around the free cash flow. There is been a lot of P&L-related questions. So the free cash flow, I think, was flattish in Q1 year-on-year. The net income was up a good amount. So it seems like maybe there is some working capital headwind, receivables, perhaps something there. Maybe just help us understand sort of what impact the component and supply chain issues are having on your own sort of working capital management and any cash headwinds associated with that. And how we should think about CapEx this year kind of catching up or ramping back up for ITW. And I understand that, that conversion rate metric should fall year-on-year because you are in a growth year now.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, that is exactly what is happening. I mean, we are - clearly as the top line grows 10%, you are going to see, at least in the near-term, a corresponding increase in inventory levels, which is part of what Scott talked about as demand grows, inventory levels are going to grow. The same thing with receivables. The fact that receivables are growing is actually -- as you know, it is a good thing. I think what we keep an eye on is the working capital metrics around inventory months on hand are all trending in the right direction. I will just point out that if you can see you are looking at from the outside, but when we look at our receivable aging and our bad debt, we are below pre-COVID levels in a meaningful way. So I think the teams really did an excellent job managing working capital overall, including receivables last year. And I think we talked about in the last call, working capital headwinds, somewhere around $125 million was in the plan for this year. The growth is a little bit stronger, so it might be a little bit more than that, but it is not going to change. We still are confident we will get to 100% plus conversion rate. But the goal here really is - we generate plenty of cash. The goal here is to grow the company. It would make no sense for us to try to hold back on inventory levels at this point. So on CapEx, as you know, last year, some of the capacity expansions were deferred. A lot of those are coming back now. CapEx will be somewhere around 2% of sales, which is where it has been historically. That is not a set number. That is an outcome of how we allocate capital. So if you pencil in somewhere around $300 million, that is directionally, that is probably where we will end up. That is up. I think last year, we did $236 million or something like that. So we are definitely expanding. And you saw the CapEx number moved up a little bit here in the first quarter. And that is really as these capacity expansions we are adding equipment, we are adding injection molding machines in auto and other places to support our customers as demand recovers. So.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Joe Ritchie, your line is open.\nJoseph Ritchie: Thanks for squeezing me in everybody. So my first question, maybe just focus on organic growth for a second. You raised the outlook for the year. I\u2019m curious, were any segments not raised? So for example, like some of the headwinds that you talked about in Auto OEM and the maybe slower start to the year in Food Equipment?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So all segments, except for Auto OEM, and this is based on the [run rate ratio,] right? So this is a pure mathematical, based on demand, one of the demand exit in Q1, six of seven segments are higher in terms of the organic growth forecast for the year. And in particular, the CapEx-driven businesses as we talked about, right so Test & Measurement, Welding. And then in auto, some of these supply chain issues and the allowance we made in our guidance, they are probably towards the low end of the range that we gave back in January. I think the range back then was 14 to 18. And we are probably at the low end of that. Auto builds are still projected to be up 12% for the year. So we will see. That is the one area where there is quite a bit of uncertainty particularly. And I will just maybe reiterate this, be a little cautious around the second quarter here and not get too excited. But medium term, we are very encouraged by the underlying consumer demand as well as inventory levels, as we talked about, in that segment.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe my one follow-on, either for Scott or Michael. As you think about you guys used to always talk about your content on a regional basis in the auto segment. I\u2019m just curious, does that change at all with the uptick that we are seeing in EVs?\nScott Santi: We talked about it from a long-term opportunity perspective, it is actually roughly equivalent. it that we do around the power-train now that obviously wouldn\u2019t exist, but there is a whole range of new sort of applications in the EV space. So I think the last time we looked at it, it was on a per car basis neutral to maybe a little higher with EV.\nMichael Larsen: Higher, actually, yes.\nScott Santi: $2 versus maybe 5% to 10% higher. So net-net, we are pretty agnostic. I think the other thing that we have said in the past, this is not sort of current data, but roughly I think it was less than 1/4 of our sales would go away if every car was EV tomorrow, basically 20% or 25% of our revenues are at risk. 75% of what we do today goes in either place, and there is certainly plenty of new applications to replace that other 20% or so over time, plus a little bit.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. That is helpful. Have a good weekend everyone.\nScott Santi: Alright. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you.\nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Joe. I think we are out of time now. So I would like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Feel free to call me with any follow-up questions. And that concludes our call today.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The solid demand momentum we had coming out of the fourth quarter continued to gain strength across a broad cross-section of our business portfolio in Q1. Our operating teams around the world responded to our customers' increasing needs, as they always do, and delivered revenue growth of 10%. Organic growth of 6% was the highest organic growth rate for ITW in almost 10-years. And as Scott mentioned, Q1 had one less day this year. And on an equal days basis, organic revenue grew 8%. Organic growth was positive across all major geographies, with China leading the way with 62%, North America was up 4% and Europe grew 1%. Relative to Q4, the new trend that emerged in Q1 was a meaningful pickup in demand in our CapEx-driven equipment businesses, Test & Measurement and Electronics, which grew 11%; and Welding, which grew 6%. GAAP EPS of 2.11 was up 19% and an all-time EPS record for continuing operations. Operating leverage was a real highlight this quarter with incremental margins of 45% as operating income grew 19% year-over-year. Operating margins improved to 25.5% in the quarter, an increase of almost 200 basis points as a result of volume leverage and a continued strong contribution of 120 basis points from our enterprise initiatives, partially offset by the margin impact of price cost. Excluding the third quarter of 2017, which had the benefit of a onetime legal settlement, operating margin of 25.5% was our highest quarterly margin performance ever. As you know, supply chains around the world are under significant pressure, and ITW's operating teams certainly had to deal with their fair share of supply challenges and disruptions in the quarter. By leveraging our produce where we sell supply chain strategy, our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back business system and supported by the fact that we were fully staffed for this uptick in demand due to our window recovery initiative, we were able to maintain our normal service levels to our customers. And once again, our ability to deal with the impact of some pretty meaningful supply chain challenges and disruptions and still take care of our customers, with strong levels of profitability, speaks to the quality of the execution at ITW. In the quarter, we experienced raw material cost increases, particularly in categories such as steel, resins and chemicals. And across the company, our operating teams have already initiated pricing plans and actions that will offset all incurred as well as known but not yet incurred raw material cost increases on a dollar per dollar basis, as per our usual process. As a result, price cost is expected to be EPS-neutral for the year. As you know, given our high-margin profile, offsetting cost increases with price on a dollar per dollar basis causes some modest dilution of our operating margin percentage and our incremental margin percentage in the near-term. In Q1, for example, our operating margin was impacted 60 basis points due to price costs. And our incremental margin would actually have been 52%, not 45%, if it wasn't for this impact from price costs. For the balance of the year and embedded in our guidance are all known raw material increases and the corresponding pricing actions that have either already been implemented or will be. Again, EPS-neutral for the full-year. At this early stage in the recovery, our 25.5% operating margins are already exceeding our pre-COVID operating margins. Four of the seven segments delivered operating margin of around 28% or better in Q1, with one segment, welding, above 30% in a quarter for the first time ever. I think it says a lot of our operating teams, that when faced with the challenges of the global pandemic, they stayed focused on our long-term enterprise strategy and continue to make progress towards our long-term margin performance goal of 28% plus. After-tax return on capital was a record 32.1%. And free cash flow was solid at $541 million with a conversion of 81% of net income, in line with typical seasonality for Q1. We continue to expect 100% plus conversion for the full-year. As planned, we repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter, and the effective tax rate was 22.4%, slightly below prior year. So in summary, the first quarter was solid for ITW with broad-based organic growth of 6%, strong profitability leverage, 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental profitability and record operating margin and EPS performance. So please turn to Slide 4 for the segment performance. And the information on the left side of the page summarizes the organic revenue growth rate versus prior year by segment for Q1 this year compared to Q4 last year. And it illustrates the broad-based demand recovery that we are seeing in our businesses. And obviously, there is a positive impact as the easier comparisons begin on a year-over-year basis. With the exception of Automotive OEM, every segment had a higher organic growth rate in Q1 than they did in Q4, and six of our seven segments delivered strong organic growth in the quarter, with double-digit growth in Construction Products, and Test & Measurement and Electronics, which were also the most improved segments in this sequential view, going from down 3% in Q4 to up 11% in Q1. Welding improved eight percentage points, growing 6% in Q1, providing further evidence that the industrial CapEx recovery is beginning to take hold as visibility and confidence is coming back. At the enterprise level, ITW's organic growth rate went from down 1% in Q4 to up 6%. And I would just highlight that this is 6% organic growth with one of our segments, Food Equipment, while on its way to recovery is still down 10% year-over-year. As we go through the segment slides, you will see that this robust organic growth, combined with strong enterprise initiative impact, contributed to some pretty strong operating margin performance in our segments. So let's go into a little more detail for each segment, starting with our Automotive OEM. And the demand recovery in the fourth quarter continued this quarter with organic growth of 8% and total revenue growth of 13%. North America revenue was down 2% as customers continue to adjust their production schedules in response to the well-publicized shortage of certain components, including semiconductor chips. We estimate this impacted our Q1 sales by about $25 million, and it is likely to continue to impact our revenues to the tune of about $50 million in Q2 and another $50 million in the second half of the year. As you can appreciate, the situation is obviously pretty fluid, but as we sit here today, that is our best estimate, and that is also what we embedded in our updated guidance. Looking past the near-term supply chain issues affecting the auto industry, we are pretty optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects as consumer demand remains strong and dealer inventories are very low by historical standards. By region, North America being down in Q1 was more than offset by Europe, which was up 4%, and China up 58%. And finally, the team delivered solid operating margin performance of 24.1%, an improvement of 320 basis points. Please turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment. So revenue was down 7%, with organic revenue down 10%, but like I said, much improved versus Q4. And there are solid signs that demand is beginning to recover, as evidenced by orders picking up and a backlog that is up significantly versus prior year. Overall, North America was down 6%, with equipment down only 1% as compared to a 22% decline in Q4. Institutional, which represents about 35% of our North American equipment business was down 7%, with healthcare about flat and education is still down about 10%. Restaurants, which represents 25% of our equipment business, was down in the mid-teens, with full-service restaurants down about 30%, but fast casual up low single digits. Retail, which is now 25% of the business, was up more than 20% as a result of strong demand and new product rollouts. International was down 15% and is really a tale of two regions. As you would expect, Europe was down 22% due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific was up 44%, with China up 99%. Overall equipment sales were down 4% and service down 19%. Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered revenue growth of 14% with 11% organic growth. Test & Measurement was up 7% with continued strength in semiconductors and healthcare end markets now supplemented by strengthening demand in the capital equipment businesses as evidenced by the Instron business growing 12%. The electronics business grew 16%, with strong demand for team room technology products, automotive applications and consumer electronics. Operating margin of 28.4% was up 330 basis points. Moving to Slide 6. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a strong sequential improvement in Welding as the segment delivered organic growth of 6%, the highest growth rate in almost three-years. The commercial business, which serves smaller businesses and individual users, usually leads the way in a recovery, and Q1 was their third quarter in a row with double-digit growth, up 17% this quarter. The industrial business continued its sequential improvement trend and was down only 1% with customer CapEx spend picking up and backlogs building. Overall, equipment sales were up 10% and consumables were flat versus prior year. North America was up 7%. And international growth of 4% was primarily driven by recovery in China and some early signs of demand picking up in oil and gas. Solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives contributed to a record margin performance of 30.3%, which, as I said, marked the first time an ITW segment delivered operating margins above 30%. Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 9%, with polymers up 16%, driven by strength in MRO applications particularly for heavy industries. The automotive aftermarket business continued to benefit from strong retail sales with organic growth of 9%, while fluids, which has a larger presence in Europe was down 1%. Operating margin benefited from solid volume leverage and enterprise initiatives to deliver margins of 25.7%. Moving to Slide 7. Construction was the fastest-growing segment this quarter with organic growth of 13%. North America was up 12%, with continued strong demand in residential renovation and in the home center channel. Commercial construction, which is only about 15% of our U.S. sales, was up 3%. European sales grew 19% with double-digit growth in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Australia and New Zealand grew 7%, with strength in both residential and commercial markets. Operating margin of 27.6% was an improvement of 420 basis points. Specialty revenues were up 10% with organic revenue of 7% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 6%; Europe, up 5%; and Asia Pacific was up 24%. Demand for consumer packaging remained solid at 6%. So please turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full-year 2021 guidance. And per our usual process, and with the caveat that we are only one quarter into the New Year and a significant number of uncertainties and challenges are still in front of us, we are raising our guidance on all key performance metrics, including organic growth, operating margin and EPS. In doing so, we have obviously factored in our solid Q1 results. And per our usual process, we are projecting current levels of demand exit in Q1, into the future and addressing them for typical seasonality. And as discussed, we have made an allowance for the estimated impact of semiconductor chip shortages on our Auto OEM customers. The outcome of that exercise is an organic growth forecast of 10% to 12% at the enterprise level. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 7% to 10%. Foreign currency at today's exchange rates adds two percentage points to revenue for total revenue growth forecast of 12% to 14%. As you saw, we are off to a strong start on operating leverage and enterprise initiatives, and we are raising our operating margin guidance by 100 basis points to a new range of 25% to 26%, which incorporates all known raw material cost increases and the corresponding pricing actions. Relative to 2020, our 2021 operating margins of 25% to 26% are 250 basis points higher at the midpoint and they are almost 150 basis points higher than our pre-COVID 2019 operating margins of 24.1% as we continue to make progress towards our long-term performance goal of 28% plus, as I mentioned earlier. Our incremental margins for the full-year are expected to be above our typical 35% to 40% range. Finally, we are raising our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.60 and or 8% to a new range of $8.20 to $8.60. The new midpoint of $8.40 represents an earnings growth rate of 27% versus prior year and a 9% increase relative to pre-COVID 2019 EPS of $7.74. A few final housekeeping items to wrap it up, with no changes to: one, the forecast for free cash flow; two, our plan to repurchase approximately $1 billion of our own shares; and three, our expected tax rate of 23% to 24%. As per usual process, our guidance is for the core business only and excludes the previously announced acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business. The process to close the acquisition by mid-year remains on-track. And once the acquisition closes, we will provide an update. As we have said before, we do not expect a material financial impact to earnings in 2021. So in summary, a quarter of quality execution in a challenging environment, and as a result, we are off to a solid start to the year. So with that, Karen, I will turn it back to you. Okay, Jamie. So I think on the first one, it is a little too early to tell. I mean I think we certainly feel very good about how we are positioned with our Win the Recovery strategy and the fact that we stayed invested, giving us the ability to capture market share as we have talked about. So I think it is a little too early to tell how much of that growth in Q1 is really market versus market share gains. And I will just add to that, we have also seen an uptick from the contribution of our customer-back innovation efforts. And so again, that is a result of being able to stay invested in those. And then I would point to our supply chain and our ability to maintain our service levels, where maybe others are struggling a little bit more. So I think anecdotally, there are certainly lots of evidence, if you were to ask our divisions and our segments that we are picking up share. And again, we are going after sustainable, high-quality, profitable market share gains, not opportunistic. And so we feel really good about the start to the year on account of those things. I think on the incrementals, I agree with you, that was a real bright spot, significantly above our normal range of 35% to 40%. At these early stages in the recovery, we expect to be able to maintain the incrementals above the typical range. So 40% plus is what we are planning for and also embedded in our guidance, as you saw today. If you do the math, that is where you end up. I think it is a little premature to update kind of the long-term incremental margin expectations. I think we are comfortable with kind of long-term in the 35% to 40% range. We are certainly making a lot of improvement to the cost structure of the company. But let's revisit that at a later stage in terms of what we think the long-term incrementals might be on a go-forward basis. For now, if you think kind of beyond this year, I would still stick to the kind of the 35% to 40%. Thank you. I mean, I think the one obvious one, Scott, is the auto business, where just given the nature of the business and how the contracts are structured, getting price takes a little longer and requires a funnel of new products that are coming in at more attractive margins. So that is the one where, in the near-term, we are seeing the most significant pressure on margins from a price cost standpoint. And the other six segments, I think there is, given the differentiated nature of the products and services that we provide, we have a long history of being able to offset any cost increases with price. There is typically a little bit of a lag. I will tell you, we learned some things when we went through this in 2018. We are definitely much more, say, focused and on top of things earlier on. And our divisions are taking the actions that are required to kind of stay ahead of things this time around. So while there is certainly some pressure here, you saw 60 basis points of margin percentage impact and seven percentage points of incremental margin impact. The overall goal here is to offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and we are confident that we will be able to do that for the year and in total, even with the pressure and the difficulty in automotive. Thanks. Yes. I think, Ann, as you are saying, that was kind of the new trend that showed up here in the first quarter. We did see orders and backlog starting to build last year on the equipment side. But really in Q1 here, if you look at the businesses that had the most significant improvement relative to historical run rates, they are Test & Measurement, as I mentioned, and Welding. And so those are businesses that are more driven by investment in CapEx. And I think as the visibility to the recovery and the confidence in the recovery takes hold, our customers are placing orders for larger equipment. And we saw a little bit of that also in Specialty Products, on the packaging equipment side. And it is really a broad-based trend. So I don't really have the breakdown for you on a global basis, but really across the board, we saw really nice pickup in demand for the CapEx-driven products and those three businesses in particular. And I think we are off to a good start here in April. So I think we saw good momentum coming into Q1, kind of sustained that. March was a strong month. And April, everything is on-track here. Andy, the easy answer to your question is, with the types of incrementals that our segments are putting up - the enterprise level is 45, welding was also 45, the answer is that margins will continue to improve just from the volume leverage alone. And then we know that there is still a ways to go to reach our full potential from an 80/20 front-to-back implementation standpoint as well. You see these enterprise initiatives continue to come in at 120 basis points at the enterprise level. Maybe a little bit less than that in Welding, but still a significant contribution from the initiatives. And so I have said this many times, and I will continue to say this. I mean, and then it is based on the bottoms-up planning that we do. We expect that all of our segments will continue to improve their operating margin performance, like I said, as demand recovers. And maybe more importantly, we still have a lot of things within our own control here that regardless of what happens from a demand standpoint, we can continue to improve the margin performance... While growing... That is right. That is right. We can do both, right. And then what I said in my comments is what is really encouraging, I think, is that with everything going on last year and right now, with supply chain as well, the fact that our teams leverage this Win the Recovery strategy, stayed focused on executing a long-term enterprise strategy, and we are sitting here really you could argue one quarter into the recovery, and we have a clear path in front of us as we continue to make progress towards our 28%. You said 28%. I thought my comments I may have said 28% plus. That we continue to make progress towards our long-term margin goal of 28% plus. Not yet is the answer. I mean, like I mentioned, we are starting to see a pickup in orders and backlog. As you know, these businesses are not really backlog-driven. But the quoting activity is solid, and it is reasonable to assume that there will be a pickup on the institutional side as we move forward, including for schools. So I think that is part of what is encouraging is we are not firing on all cylinders yet. We put up some pretty good results here in Q1 and we still have Food Equipment, as you mentioned, down 10% organic, with a strong recovery ahead of it. So I think that is really encouraging. Welcome. Yes. So let me start by saying I would be a little cautious on Q2. There is a little bit of a timing issue here. And just given how high our margins are, I think these price cost pressures will remain with us, particularly in the near-term. So Q2, this will be dilutive to margin percentage, again, EPS-neutral on a dollar-for-dollar basis. So it is purely a margin percentage, incremental percentage impact. So 60 basis points in Q2 -in Q1. Something around that same level, maybe a little worse than that in Q2, based on what we know today. And then it should begin to improve in the second half of the year. And maybe for the full-year, we end up somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points of margin impact. It is not, no. we have 64-days in Q2 and Q3 and 52-days in Q4, which is the same as we had last year. So this was purely a Q1 issue. If you remember, last year was a leap year. So I hate bringing this up. That is how the calendar works. Yes. So I would say, Mig, I mean, I would expect somewhere around - as our sales grow, obviously, the cost to support those sales, including things like commissions, are going to grow. And those costs are pretty correlated. And I think the last time I looked at it here a few days ago, I would assume something around 17% of sales in SG&A. And so that is maybe from a modeling standpoint, the way to look at it. I would just point to the fact, I mean, what we talked about earlier, the fact that we didn't have lots of people leave the company last year, and now we are hiring and a ton of costs are coming back in. That is not what I'm talking about here. These are simply primarily sales commissions and costs like that, that are going to grow in line with - as the top line of the company grows this year in the low teens. So that is what you would expect to see. Yes. I mean I think the one thing I know for sure is that there is going to be a big ramp-up here in Q2. I think that is a good question. I think on price cost, I mean, what we are talking about right now is this pretty significant increase in raw material costs and offsetting those dollar-for-dollar with price. And in the near-term, as I said, that puts pressure on margins. I think once you get past the surge in raw material costs and those start to kind of stabilize or maybe even come down a little bit as expected, frankly, for some of these commodities in the back half of the year, you are holding on to the price and you are going to end up in a favorable position again from a price cost standpoint. That is kind of how this has played out historically. And historically, that is what is been embedded in that 35% to 40% incremental margin rate that we have been able to put up. I think once we go through - there is kind of the planning for 2022, I will give you a better feel for the ability to maintain incremental margins either above the historical range or in the historical range. But as we sit here today, like I said earlier, for modeling purposes, I would stick to the 35% to 40% for now. And we will give you an update as we go through the year here. But clearly, this year and in Q1 and in the near-term, really strong incremental margin performance. I don't know if I said this, but we are above the range of 35% to 40%, so 40% plus, and that is with price/cost for the full-year. Headwinds are somewhere around four to five percentage points to the incremental margin. So really strong performance here as the recovery takes hold. Okay. That is fair. Yes, I think that is for you to decide. I think the argument you are making is not unreasonable. I think what we do is we give you kind of the outlook for the company at current run rates. And if you think that Food Equipment is going to come back stronger or you think the auto issue is a bigger issue, then you can certainly make those adjustments to your model. And as you know, ITW is this is a pretty predictable company certainly at the enterprise level. And so you can get pretty close to the models that we are looking at. And so we think this is the best way to communicate the outlook for the company and being very transparent. And then it is for you to decide kind of segment-by-segment how you think things might play out based on whatever data points that you look at. Yes. So really no new update, I mean, as you recall, we put those on hold last year really to focus on the recovery here. And the most important thing we have to do is get the organic growth rate and demonstrate that we can grow consistently above market. The view was that working on divestitures is really a distraction from that. And by the way, we believe, and it is playing out that way, as these businesses are going to be more valuable when we kind of reinitiate the process, which will probably be somewhere at the end of this year, early next year. So from a strategic standpoint, these are still businesses that we are that are not a great fit for ITW, that are a much better fit, frankly, with other people, we think. And so that view has not changed, but we have kind of deferred all the activities to later this year or early next year. Yes. I mean, that is exactly what is happening. I mean, we are - clearly as the top line grows 10%, you are going to see, at least in the near-term, a corresponding increase in inventory levels, which is part of what Scott talked about as demand grows, inventory levels are going to grow. The same thing with receivables. The fact that receivables are growing is actually -- as you know, it is a good thing. I think what we keep an eye on is the working capital metrics around inventory months on hand are all trending in the right direction. I will just point out that if you can see you are looking at from the outside, but when we look at our receivable aging and our bad debt, we are below pre-COVID levels in a meaningful way. So I think the teams really did an excellent job managing working capital overall, including receivables last year. And I think we talked about in the last call, working capital headwinds, somewhere around $125 million was in the plan for this year. The growth is a little bit stronger, so it might be a little bit more than that, but it is not going to change. We still are confident we will get to 100% plus conversion rate. But the goal here really is - we generate plenty of cash. The goal here is to grow the company. It would make no sense for us to try to hold back on inventory levels at this point. So on CapEx, as you know, last year, some of the capacity expansions were deferred. A lot of those are coming back now. CapEx will be somewhere around 2% of sales, which is where it has been historically. That is not a set number. That is an outcome of how we allocate capital. So if you pencil in somewhere around $300 million, that is directionally, that is probably where we will end up. That is up. I think last year, we did $236 million or something like that. So we are definitely expanding. And you saw the CapEx number moved up a little bit here in the first quarter. And that is really as these capacity expansions we are adding equipment, we are adding injection molding machines in auto and other places to support our customers as demand recovers. So. Sure. Yes. So all segments, except for Auto OEM, and this is based on the [run rate ratio,] right? So this is a pure mathematical, based on demand, one of the demand exit in Q1, six of seven segments are higher in terms of the organic growth forecast for the year. And in particular, the CapEx-driven businesses as we talked about, right so Test & Measurement, Welding. And then in auto, some of these supply chain issues and the allowance we made in our guidance, they are probably towards the low end of the range that we gave back in January. I think the range back then was 14 to 18. And we are probably at the low end of that. Auto builds are still projected to be up 12% for the year. So we will see. That is the one area where there is quite a bit of uncertainty particularly. And I will just maybe reiterate this, be a little cautious around the second quarter here and not get too excited. But medium term, we are very encouraged by the underlying consumer demand as well as inventory levels, as we talked about, in that segment. Higher, actually, yes. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thanks, Karen. Good morning, everyone. In Q1, we saw continued improvement in both the breadth and pace of the recovery, with six of our seven segments delivering strong growth in the quarter, with revenue increases at the segment level ranging from 6% to 13%, and that is with one less shipping day in Q1 of this year versus last year. At the enterprise level, organic growth was plus 6% in Q1 or plus 8% on an equal days basis, and that was despite the fact that our Food Equipment segment was still down 10% in the quarter. The fundamental strength of our 80/20 front-to-back business system and the skill and dedication of our people around the world, combined with the Win the Recovery actions that we initiated over the course of the past year allowed us to meet our customers' increasing needs while at the same time delivering strong profitability leverage, as evidenced by our 19% earnings growth, 45% incremental margins and 120 basis points of margin benefits from our enterprise initiatives in the quarter. Despite rising raw material costs and a tight supply chain environment, we maintained our world-class service levels to our customers while also establishing several all-time Q1 performance records for the company, including earnings per share of $2.11, operating income of $905 million at an operating margin of 25.5%. Based on our first quarter results and our normal practice of projecting current demand rates through the balance of the year, we are adjusting our 2021 guidance. For the full-year, we now expect organic growth of 10% to 12%, operating margin in the range of 25% to 26% and EPS of $8.20 to $8.60 per share, which at the $8.40 midpoint represents 27% earnings growth versus last year. At the midpoint of our revised guidance, 2021 full-year revenues would be up 1% versus 2019 and EPS would be up 9%. Now stating the obvious, there is still a lot of ground to cover between now and the end of the year, and the near-term environment is certainly not without its challenges. That being said, I have no doubt that we are well positioned to respond to whatever comes our way as we move through the remainder of the year and to continue to deliver differentiated performance in 2021 and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael. Well, I think we are really happy with the MTS acquisition, that we have got some work to do, obviously, just to get it closed. All of it is basically standard, new team. But that is I think a great example of where I think acquisitions supplement our core growth focus, which is really owning great businesses that deliver great value to their customers and that we can grow organically. And MTS certainly adds and supplements our capabilities in terms of the Test & Measurement space and our ability to do so. I'm not going to comment on your specific reference or any other deals that others have announced recently, but I would say that we - our appetite for additional MTS-light deals remains certainly strong. I can't remember exactly the term used, Jeff, but I think the phrase opportunistic is the right way to think about it. It is a combination of, ultimately, what we are interested in doing, what fits with the availability of assets that fit that profile. And that includes both their strategic attributes, the attributes that they offer in terms of our ability to improve their inherent financial performance and all at a value that we think makes sense for us and our shareholders and in terms of return on not just the capital, but the time, effort and energy that we are going to expend. So that is sort of the generic strategic narrative around it. My personal view is I absolutely think, on average, one to three MTS kinds of deals a year seems to be a reasonable - something that absolutely is achievable. We are not going to try to sort of force a deal every year on that. So some years are going to be zero because the circumstances are not going to present - the circumstances that we are looking for are not going to present themselves. But I think there is lots of room for other similar kinds of deals to be additive to what we are doing in a relatively consistent way over, let's say, the 5-year period. I think I will stop there. I think it is hard to project the balance of the year. I would say, for sure, in the second quarter, there are broader issues than just automotive at play. And I would also say that it is absolutely fair that we are having to work a lot harder in terms of securing our own sources of supply than we would under normal circumstances. So we have, for a number of reasons, I think, been able to counter punch our way through a much more challenging supply environment in the first quarter and through the second quarter, I think we are going to be able to do the same, broadly speaking, partly because we source local, that is - we know our suppliers. We source where we produce. And I think partly because of the fact that we stayed invested. We hang on to our people, so we are not having to add people back to support this uptick in demand. But I don't want to -- no one should take from that, that it is been smooth and easy the whole way through. So we are in it with everybody else and certainly having to work harder than normal to sustain our ability to supply. But I think so far, I feel like we have been able to, as I said, counter punch our way through it pretty well. And I would also say beyond the automotive space, there are certainly some pockets where we have some other - some of our customers being impacted by some of their own supply chain issues. Plastics remain tight in a number of areas. I don't think anything is sort of concentrated and significant as in auto, but it is certainly a scramble right now on a lot of levels. Thank you. Yes. I don't think size is a barrier at all or a limitation or something that would scare us away. I would point to MTS as being - it is not quite $0.5 billion in annual revenue. So it is not a small business by any stretch. I would tell you a couple of things. One is that we have never been more prepared from the standpoint of discipline around integration, the quality of practice around our 80/20 front-to-back operating system, the depth of talent. This is all a result of the last nine-years of work on this. So all of that certainly is just additive to, I think, our ability to - if we find the right opportunity to do a really good job with it. So it is not an issue of - size doesn't scare us. I think sometimes what does happen is the larger the size, there tends to be it is a time to sort of a pure play. This is the part of the business. We want it all. The bigger the asset, the more sort of nonstrategic, non-desirable stuff you have to deal with sometimes. But that is also just sort of part of the tactics. But again, I don't think it is big or small that is the driving benefit to us as much as does it really fit with what we are good at, does it fit an area of the market we think has long-term above market organic growth prospects, et cetera. And whether it is large or relatively small, and by that I mean division size, those would be equally attractive options to us. You bet. Thanks. Yes. I actually probably can't answer that last piece other than to say that the business for us that is really of the biggest scale in China is auto. And they did a phenomenal job, if you look at the kind of volume. Now that is a big number year-on-year, but remember that China was way down in the first quarter last year. So from the standpoint of the sequential, I don't have that. I don't know, maybe you have, Michael, from Q4 to Q1, it wasn't a 58% jump, right. But I would say, overall, our decision to hang on to our people and just be ready for this has certainly given us an ability to respond. That if we were having to not only source scramble for raw material, but also scramble for people, it would certainly be a more difficult challenge than it was. Yes. I'm trying to think about how to sort of tackle that one, John. Maybe the place to start is, inherent in our system is, we always talk about the fact that we produce today what our customers bought yesterday. So what makes that work is the fact that we are always carrying surplus capacity, on the order of magnitude of 15% to 20% over what current demand is. Because that demand comes, it is an average on a daily basis. So the only way we can produce today what our customers bought yesterday, as that number moves up and down, is to make sure that we have ample extra capacity to flex. So that sort of helps us as things accelerate, we do have a cushion to lean on. We also have - our supplier base is connected into that system in a way that they are also carrying that kind of ability to flex. Now it works really well. It doesn't work perfectly, certainly with - we have our sort of rubs and issues along the way, and I'm sure we will. But there are things that we can overcome and work our way through. But maybe that is the best answer. I don't know if that totally addresses it, but we start with a sort of level of flex that certainly helps us respond and add even more capacity as we are pivoting into kind of an environment where the economy is starting to tick off. Yes, I'm completely comfortable that they know exactly what to do. I mean, again, we have hung on to all of our people through this. We have hang on to all of our capacity. We are locked and loaded and ready to go. I have no doubt about it, into equipment, and everywhere else in the company. You bet. Yes. I would be pretty certain it is going to have some impact in terms of the overall pace of the recovery in a number of areas. My personal view, Ann, is that is maybe not even such a bad thing in terms of extending the duration of the recovery and sort of managing the pace a little bit in the short run. So even with this auto, auto is a real extreme example of that, not so much on labor, but from semiconductor chips. Michael talked about the fact that consumer demand for autos is strong. Dealer inventories are at, I think, around the world, historic lows. So the fact that all of that is not trying to be satisfied in two quarters and it actually gets spread out, and so I just use that same analogy in places like Food Equipment, as I don't think it is necessarily a terrible thing that there are some limitations, either labor or other things, as we move through the recovery in some of our sectors. It doesn't mean demand isn't going to grow. It is not going to be this feeding frenzy of satisfying in a relatively short period of time. I don't know exactly how it is all going to play out, but I don't think some of those limitations in the near-term are necessarily bad things for the long haul, if that makes sense. While they grew at an accelerated rate organically. That is the yin and the yang of the... Yes. Well, I would be happy to try to address some of that. Let me start at the end of your question first. We are not interested in consolidation. We are not an economy scale company. We are not going to buy anything to consolidate. We are going to own great businesses that deliver value for their customers through the performance of the products and services that they offer. And so whether the industry consolidates or not, ultimately, we compete based on our ability to deliver superior value to the customers that we choose to target in those industries. And so that is essentially all I will say our businesses are very well positioned in this space. We expect that they will continue to grow at an accelerated rate with best-in-class margins and returns in that industry. And absolutely, to your point, we will have to continue to evolve and innovate as our customers evolve and innovate based on COVID or anything else in terms of what happens in that industry. And I think I will just leave it there. We talked about it from a long-term opportunity perspective, it is actually roughly equivalent. it that we do around the power-train now that obviously wouldn't exist, but there is a whole range of new sort of applications in the EV space. So I think the last time we looked at it, it was on a per car basis neutral to maybe a little higher with EV. $2 versus maybe 5% to 10% higher. So net-net, we are pretty agnostic. I think the other thing that we have said in the past, this is not sort of current data, but roughly I think it was less than 1/4 of our sales would go away if every car was EV tomorrow, basically 20% or 25% of our revenues are at risk. 75% of what we do today goes in either place, and there is certainly plenty of new applications to replace that other 20% or so over time, plus a little bit. Alright. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results and provide guidance for full year 2023.  Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release.  Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, in Q4, we delivered a strong finish to a year of high-quality execution in the face of some pretty unique challenges in the operating environment. Starting with the top line organic growth, was 12% as all segments delivered positive organic growth, and five of our seven segments grew double digits, led by Auto OEM, up 20%, Food Equipment, up 17%, Welding, up 15%, Polymers & Fluids, up 11% and Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 10%. Construction Products was up 4%, and Specialty Products was up 3%. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.8%, with 110 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives and favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points, which was for the first time in nine quarters -- which was favorable for the first time in nine quarters.  Incremental margin was 52%, and operating income grew 18%. GAAP earnings per share increased 53% to a record $2.95, including $0.61 of gains from divestitures and $0.12 of negative currency -- excluding $0.61, sorry, of divestiture gains and $0.12 of negative currency EPS growth was 27%. For all of 2022, the company delivered organic growth of 12% for the second year in a row, best-in-class operating margin of 24.4% in our base business, after-tax return on invested capital of 29.1% and record GAAP EPS of $9.77, an increase of 15% versus the prior year.  There's no question that our decision to stay invested in our enterprise strategy and then our people throughout the pandemic and the quality of our team's execution of our when the recovery focus coming out of it are powering the strong growth and financial performance, ITW is currently delivering. As a result, we are very pleased with our momentum and positioning heading into 2023. Turning to our 2023 guidance. Demand remained solid across the majority of our portfolio, and we are seeing meaningful improvements in supply chain performance and moderating input cost inflation. At the same time, there's no question that the economic outlook, let's call it, remains certainly dynamic. As a result, our organic growth projection for 2023 of 3% to 5% and our EPS guidance of $9.60 at the midpoint reflect current levels of demand and a risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. And Michael will provide more detail on that in just a minute. Before I turn it over to Michael, I want to again thank my ITW colleagues around the world for their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence.  Michael, over to you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The demand growth that we've experienced all year continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 12%. On an equal day\u2019s basis, organic growth was 14% as the fourth quarter this year had one less shipping day compared to prior year.  We finished the year with strong growth momentum as evidenced by our sequential organic revenue growth of plus 4% from Q3 into Q4 on a sales per day basis as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%. By geography, every major region grew double digit, with North America up 13%, Europe up 11% and China up 10%.  Foreign currency translation headwind reduced revenue by 5%, and the net impact from acquisitions and divestitures was plus 1%. GAAP EPS grew 53% to $2.95 and included a $0.61 gain from two divestitures, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. Excluding those gains, EPS increased 21% to $2.34, which included $0.12 of EPS headwind from foreign currency translation. So, on an apples-to-apples basis, eliminating both divestiture gains and currency headwind, EPS increased 27%. On the bottom line, operating income grew 18%, with strong incremental margin performance of 52% and operating margin improved 210 basis points to 24.8%. Operating margin in our base businesses, excluding MTS, was 25.2%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points. And as Scott said, this was the first quarter with favorable margin impact from price/cost since the third quarter of 2020.  Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points. As you saw in the press release, we completed two divestitures in the fourth quarter, resulting in a combined pretax gain on sale of $197 million recorded in nonoperating income and an EPS impact of $0.61. By utilizing capital loss carryforwards to offset taxes on the divestiture gains, the overall tax rate for the company was 19.1%. So overall, for Q4, excellent operational execution across the board, strong financial performance and what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment. Okay. Please turn to Slide 4, starting with our progress on organic growth. And as you know, we've been aggressively executing a very focused growth strategy to build consistent above-market organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with our operational 80/20 front-to-back capabilities.  As you can see from the data on the left side of the slide, ITW's 12% organic growth rate for each of the last two years compares favorably to our proxy peers at about 9% both years, suggesting that while we're not there yet in terms of realizing ITW's full potential organic growth performance, we're making some very solid progress. Moving on to the segment results, starting with Automotive OEM, which led the way with organic growth of 20%. Year-on-year revenue growth was, of course, helped by supply chain challenges in the industry last year. North America was up 15% and Europe grew 23%. China was up 17% with particularly strong growth in electric vehicles. On a full year basis, ITW Automotive OEM revenues were up 12% versus 6% growth in car builds. Looking forward, we expect Automotive OEM to grow 5% to 7% in 2023 based on a risk-adjusted auto build assumption in the low single digits plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered another very strong quarter with organic growth of 17%. North America grew 25% with double-digit growth in all major categories and end markets. Institutional was up more than 40% with strength across the board, restaurants were up 30% and retail grew 20%. International revenue grew 7%, with Europe up 9% and Asia Pacific was flat with some near-term softness in China.  The Food Equipment team also delivered excellent progress on margins, with Q4 operating margin of 27.6%, an increase of almost 500 basis points year-over-year. So obviously, strong momentum in this segment, and we expect Food Equipment to grow 8% to 10% in 2023. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 15%, with organic growth of 10%. Test & Measurement grew 12% organic, excluding the acquisition of MTS, with continued strong demand for capital equipment as evidenced by Instron, which grew 24%. Electronics was up 7%.  While our semi-related businesses, which represent combined annual revenues of about $550 million or approximately 20% of the segment, grew 17% in the quarter. We are beginning to see a slowdown in demand after three years of very strong growth. So, embedded in our 2023 organic growth projection of 2% to 4% for this segment is anticipated further slowing in semi-related end markets. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered strong organic growth of 15% in Q4, with equipment up 17% and consumables up 13%. Industrial sales remained very strong with organic growth of 25%. On the commercial side, which is more consumer-oriented, demand continued to slow and organic growth was down 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 15%, and international grew 17%, driven by strength in the oil and gas business, up 19%. Operating margin was up 160 basis points to 31.6%, a new record for the segment and for the company. Looking forward, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 7% in 2023, which includes some anticipated further slowing on the commercial Welding side. Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 11%, with the automotive aftermarket business up 13% with some seasonal strength in wiper blades. Polymers grew 11% with continued strength in industrial applications, and Fluids was up 5%. North America grew 11% and international was up 10%. Looking forward, we expect Polymers & Fluids to grow 3% to 5% in 2023, which is based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in the more consumer-oriented automotive aftermarket business. Turning to Slide 7. Overall demand in Construction slowed to an organic growth rate of plus 4%. North America was still up 9%, with residential up 11% and commercial construction was down 6% due to a tough comparison of plus 21% last year. Europe was up 3% and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. As you know, Construction is our most interest rate sensitive segment, and we are projecting further slowing in 2023 and a negative organic growth rate of minus 5% to minus 3%. Specialty organic growth was 3% as supply chain shortages eased up in Q4, and the equipment businesses had a strong finish to the year with organic growth of 8%. Consumables were up 2%. And on a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international grew 7%. Looking forward, we expect Specialty organic revenue of negative 1% to plus 1% in 2023, which is based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in the appliance components business. So, let's turn to Slide 8 for a recap of a very strong 2022. As throughout the year, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers, while responding quickly and decisively to rapidly rising input costs, navigating supply chain disruptions and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy.  As a result, for the full year, ITW grew organic revenue by 12% with double-digit growth in five of seven segments. And despite significant price/cost margin pressures and thanks in part to 90 basis points contribution from our enterprise initiatives, our base businesses expanded operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.4%. GAAP EPS of $9.77 was a record for ITW with EPS growth of 15% on top of 28% EPS growth in 2021. Excluding divestiture gains and negative currency translation impact, EPS grew 12% in 2022 on an apples-to-apples basis. In 2022, we also invested more than $700 million to accelerate organic growth and to sustain productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. Raised our dividend 7%, marking the 59th year of consecutive increases. Returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and made solid progress on the integration of a very high-quality acquisition in the MTS Test and Simulation business. And most importantly, we delivered these results while continuing to make meaningful progress on our path to ITW's full potential through the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy. So, let's move to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. And while we certainly see some positives in terms of supply chain easing and moderating input cost inflation, there's also no doubt that the economic outlook and demand picture is becoming increasingly uncertain. On our last Q3 earnings call, we pointed to pockets of slowing demand at approximately 20% of our business portfolio. And today, we would add semiconductor-related end markets to the mix bringing the total to about 25% of ITW's portfolio.  In our view, it therefore made sense to take a more cautious approach to our top line guidance this year by basing it not just on current levels of demand, adjusted for seasonality as we typically do, but rather anticipating further slowing in end markets related to construction, commercial welding, auto aftermarket, appliances and semiconductor. As a result, our organic growth rate projection for 2023 of 3% to 5% is lower than our typical run rate approach. Operating margin is expected to improve by 100 basis points or more to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. This includes approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives and positive price/cost margin impact based on all known and implemented price and cost actions. After tax return on invested capital should improve to 30% plus, and we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income. For 2023, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $9.40 to $9.80, which also includes $0.15 to $0.20 of higher interest expense on our short-term debt and $0.25 of increased income tax expense as our tax rate will revert to our normal, approximately 24% versus 22% in 2022, excluding the tax impacts from our divestitures. In terms of cadence for the year, we're now back to our typical first half, second half EPS split of 49% and 51%.  Our capital allocation plans for 2023 are consistent with our long-standing disciplined capital allocation framework. Our top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth initiatives and sustain our highly profitable core businesses. The second priority is an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, which remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high-quality acquisitions, such as MTS, that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential and have significant margin improvement potential from the implication of our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back methodology and can generate acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital. And finally, surplus capital will be allocated to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buy back approximately $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2023.  Turning to our last slide, Slide 10, for our 2023 organic growth projections by segment. And you can see that we're expecting solid to mid -- solid mid- to high single-digit organic growth in four of our seven segments, offsetting some lower growth rates in Test & Measurement and Electronics, which is due to semiconductor demand, as well as in Construction and Specialty resulting in an overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level of 3% to 5%, which is on top of 12% organic growth in each of the last two years. Overall, we're heading into 2023 with strong momentum, and we're very well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge as we move through 2023.  And so, with that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Michael. Cheryl, please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, my first question, you talked about the 25% of your portfolio where you're starting to see weakness. Can you talk -- I know semis be incremental. Can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing in semi? And then on the 75% rest of your portfolio are trends in line with your expectations, a little more positive or negative versus last quarter? And then I guess, just my follow-up question to that price/cost in the quarter, I think it was 70 bps positive. I think that's a little better than what you expected. Was that driven more by price or raw going down? And then what are your assumptions on the ability to hold price in 2023? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Okay. That was a lot there, Jamie. I'll do my best, okay? So, I think the color on semi is really the -- we're coming off a three year very strong growth cycle with growth in the high teens or better than that over those three years. And we are starting to see a slowdown in the order intake really in Q4.  So, it hasn't really showed up in our numbers in a meaningful way yet, but we do expect that to continue into 2023. We think it's more of a near-term slowdown. And like you said, that is the addition to the portfolio we've said before, 20% is slowing. Demand is slowing now. It's 25%, and semi is really the incremental 5% this quarter. But it's important to keep in mind that the balance, the other 75% of the portfolio, continues to perform at a really high level. And I'll just point to the 12% organic we put up in Q4 and for the full year. And then if you look at our guidance on Slide 10, by segment, you can see mid- to high single-digit growth in Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Welding, mid-single digit in Polymers & Fluids and then a little bit lower in Test & Measurement. And then of course, Construction is the one that's a little bit projected to be down year-over-year and Specialty about flat. I'll also say, if you just look at from Q3 to Q4, we -- typically, our sales per day go up 2%, we actually went up 4%. So, we're more than offsetting some of the slowing that we're seeing in 25% of the portfolio. So good momentum, really well positioned going into next year. I think on the price/cost side, we were really encouraged. We talked about this on the last call and an expectation of being positive -- slightly positive on margins on price/cost in Q4. This was a little bit better, driven by both sides of the equation really price and cost, but it was certainly great to see that turn positive for the first time since I think I said the third quarter 2020. So, first time in eight quarters, so really encouraging heading into 2023.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning. Congrats on another strong year in '22.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you.\nScott Davis: A little bit of a nit, but on the 3% to 5%, 23 top line for growth forecast. Is there any real price in that? Or you anniversary the big price increases that you had in Welding and now you're kind of more in the kind of neutral-ish to maybe slightly positive versus a bigger number?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think we are certainly lapping some bigger price numbers. There's no doubt about that. And I think, as you know, we don't break out price and volume separately for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. But there's both price and volume in the numbers that we've laid out for 2023. And the 3% to 5% organic, I'll just say it's a risk-adjusted number. If you do a pure run rate, you end up at a higher number. We just thought given the -- everything we talked about, it was probably reasonable to take a more cautious approach given the environment.\nScott Davis: Yes. No, it totally makes sense. What about the inflation assumptions in general when you guys think about the '23 outlook as far as kind of breaking out materials versus labor? And is it fair to assume that labor inflation remains reasonably high, but material inflation is more moderated? Is that a fair assumption in your guide?\nMichael Larsen : Yes. I think that's reasonable. I think certainly materials and components in that order, we are seeing -- I wouldn't say price are coming -- costs are coming down in a significant way, and they're remaining at a fairly elevated level. And then I think on -- our labor costs, certainly we're experiencing the same labor cost inflation as others. But -- and so maybe a little bit higher than typical, but nothing really that significant. We're still expanding margins by 100 basis points or better here in 2023. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nScott Davis : Yes, it does. Thank you. And best of luck this year. \nMichael Larsen : Sure. Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria : Good morning. Congrats on the great results. So I have a couple of quick ones. The first one is how should we think about your EBIT margin progression throughout the year? Is the 25.5% to -- 24.5% to 25.5% range going to be fairly consistent in all the quarters?\nMichael Larsen : So Tami, like I said, we're kind of back to our typical cadence here. I think we said first half, 49% of our EPS for the full year; second half, 51%. We really -- if you go back unlike time, we've been remarkably consistent. Embedded in that is also the fact that Q1 is typically our lowest quarter in terms of revenue, and we're expecting somewhere in the mid-single-digit type growth. Margins will probably start out a little bit lower, but still 100 basis points of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And maybe just to give an additional data point, if you run the same data on Q1 contribution to EPS overall, it's somewhere around 23% of the full year, and that's a pretty -- the company has become remarkably predictable over the years. And so I think that's probably a pretty good estimate for how the first quarter might play out.\nTami Zakaria : Got it. That's fantastic color. Thank you. And I'm just going to ask the question and I hope I get lucky and get a number. But can you share what organic growth is trending quarter-to-date? Any segments trending negative right now?\nMichael Larsen : So we just saw the January numbers and everything looks fine. Everything is tracking and really nothing different from what we talked about in the script here. So we're off to the start that we thought we would have.\nTami Zakaria: Okay, awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Michael, when we think about margin expectations for '23 across your segments, does the lag in price versus cost flipped the most in Auto OEMs, so you could see a nice jump in margin in that segment? Or should we generally think that your segment margin will trend with who has the highest growth forecast versus the weakest growth forecast in '23?\nMichael Larsen : I think, Andy, we expect -- all of our planning here at ITW has done bottoms up, as I think you know. And every one of our segments, including the higher-margin ones, such as Welding as well as Automotive, which is really dealing with some near-term pressures primarily related to price cost as well as just volume leverage. Every one of our 7 segments told us that they expect to improve margins year-over-year in 2023. But obviously, the ones that have the higher growth rates are going to have more volume leverage and therefore, probably a more significant improvement in operating margin. But everybody will get better. I would just say on Automotive, it's going to take some time to recover the price/cost margin impact, which has been significantly higher in Automotive than in other segments for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. It takes a little bit longer to recover price.  So I think our current view is it will take us maybe two to three years to get back to automotive margins in the low to mid-20s. And so that's maybe how I would -- we would characterize it.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Michael. And then can you give us an update on the longevity of enterprise initiatives? ITW continues to I think we might begin to get a little spoiled here that it could last indefinitely. So how are you thinking about enterprise strategy? Do you still see a long runway of initiatives across your segments? And where will the focus of enterprise strategy be across your segments in '23? \nMichael Larsen : Well...\nScott Santi : Yes, go ahead, you start.\nMichael Larsen : Okay. Well, I think we're in the tenth year now. I think if you add up the combined savings, it's approaching $1.5 billion of structural cost out from 80/20 and from strategic sourcing. And when we rolled up the plans here in November and check back in, in January and had a chance to review all the projects and activities that go into delivering these 100 basis points, we were really encouraged by what we saw. And so I know that for a couple of years, we've been saying -- I've been saying this is not going to go on forever, and I...\nScott Santi : We were wrong.\nMichael Larsen : And I was wrong, which happens a lot. But I think, ultimately, look, I think if you model ITW long term, I'd go back to the TSR model we've given you, which is 4% plus organic growth, incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range. Then operating income grew $7 million. You add acquisitions and buybacks on top of that. And so EPS grows 9% to 10%, and you add an attractive dividend in that 2% to 3% range. 2% to 3% range on top of it, you get 11% to 13% over the long term, that's what you should expect us to deliver. And so I think I have to say, to give you a definite and on enterprise initiatives because, as Scott reminded me, I've been wrong for many years. But that's probably how I would think about it, Andy.\nScott Santi : I would just add in terms of perspective that I think one of the real strengths of our operating methodology and our business model is it's there's no one definition of perfection. There is always room to get better. We use the business model as the core tool that our 84 divisions used to identify and prioritize opportunities to get better. And I don't see that stopping for quite a while.\nMichael Larsen : Right. I think we've said this before. I mean, this proprietary ITW business model is more powerful than it's ever been as we sit here today. It's much different from 10 years ago, 3 years ago. And we are applying it. Our people, we've all gotten better at applying these methodologies, and we're applying it to a much more differentiated portfolio. And so as long as we continue down that path, I think it is -- I agree with Scott. I don't think it's going to end any time soon. So that's probably how we've set it up.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate all the color, guys. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : You have Sabrina Abrams [ph] on for Andrew Obin. So first on the margin guide, the 70 bps to 170 bps of year-over-year expansion includes the 100 bps of enterprise initiatives. And then, I guess, the remainder is 20 bps of price/cost at the midpoint. I'm just trying to think, is this a conservative approach? Should you had 70 bps of benefit in 4Q? Is there potential upside here?\nMichael Larsen : Well, I think maybe what would be helpful, Sabrina, is just -- let me just give you some of the elements here that go into the margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I'm going to use round numbers here, okay? So if we just ended 2022 at operating margins of about 24%, you should expect volume leverage somewhere in the 50 to 100 basis points of positive contribution to margins year-over-year, the enterprise initiatives, which is sized at about 100. We're certainly going to make some good progress on price/cost as 70 basis points was encouraging in Q4. I think the -- if that's the run rate going into 2023, maybe a little bit better than that. Let's just say price/cost adds approximately 100 basis points based on what we know today. And then the offset to some of this is our typical kind of -- we talked about this a little bit, wages and inflation on wages. We are bringing in some new hires to support our organic growth efforts. We are investing in driving organic growth, including capacity. And so that's typically a headwind of less than 100 basis points. That's running a little bit higher, just given the underlying inflation that's in the system that's probably running at 150 to 200. And so you add all that up, you get 100 basis points plus of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I think that's a pretty good number, Sabrina.\nUnidentified Company Speaker : Got it. That's helpful. And so China, I guess, was strong in Auto OEM in 4Q. Just trying to think what's incorporated in your guide for China reopening next year? \nMichael Larsen : Well, I think, as we look at kind of on a geographic basis, including China, most of our regions are kind of in that mid-single digits for the year. And China is maybe a little bit higher than that. A big driver, as you pointed out, in China is really the Automotive business, where we continue to make a lot of progress in terms of market share and penetration gains. So that's certainly our largest business and also the biggest driver of our growth in China next year. And so if the total company is 3% to 5% organic, China is certainly a little bit higher than that in our current projections as we sit here today. So...\nUnidentified Company Speaker: Great. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Solid results. Just back to enterprise, I've often kind of thought of it maybe incorrectly as reflecting a little bit of a trade-off between margin and growth. And maybe originally, it was more cost oriented, but the organic growth here recently would suggest you're not trading growth for margin. And I wonder if you could just kind of comment on that. Obviously, the growth has enjoyed a cyclical lift the last couple of years. So I don't want to overstate the point, but it does seem that the system has thrown up at organic growth than it had historically? And just any context on that, I think, would be interesting.\nScott Santi : Yes. First of all, Jeff, thank you for noticing. The -- what I would say in terms of just the arc of the last decade, we've been on this is that clearly, for the first five to seven years, we had a lot more work to do inside the businesses to get ourselves in position to grow. And what we're delivering now is much more about businesses that are from an operational standpoint, a lot closer to 80% or 90% of their potential. And so a lot of -- which allows a lot of our effort and attention and just to be reallocated to commercial opportunities to grow. And that's ultimately what is showing up now. We have a lot more sort of energy collectively being devoted to growth opportunities because we've gotten the internal -- the operational position of these businesses firing in sort of in a really strong position. And so it's -- you can't be great at everything all at once. It's part of, I think, what we would reflect that over the last decade and one of the real secrets to the outcomes we've delivered in my view is that we've been focused on the right things at the right time and have not tried to do too much at any stage. But we're clearly now at a stage where organic growth is the 80 of what we've got opportunities to do and what we've got to deliver on going forward. And I think that's reflected in the numbers that we're currently throwing off.\nJeff Sprague : And would -- Michael gave that piece of the bridge, wage and growth investment. Is that number other than kind of the inflationary pressures that you mentioned? Is that structurally moving higher? Or can that sort of be funded within the normal incremental margin construct and other levers that you're attempted for?\nScott Santi : That's exactly the way we do it. We are self-funding our growth investments through our incremental margin contribution. So at the 35 historical and targeted run rate, that is -- that includes -- that's after those incremental investments in growth. We're investing in capacity now in a really significant way in headcount in the areas that help us grow and supporting innovation. And we're still going to deliver of 100 bps of margin improvement next year. So that just illustrates the point of these businesses are so profitable that every incremental dollar of revenue that we generate organically drives a lot of incremental cash flow and certainly to support that we're going to invest some of that, but it doesn't impair our belief that we're in a good chunk of it to the bottom line.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for that context. \nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann : Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. A couple of quick follow-ups. Is there a portion of your portfolio where you would expect to give back price once the sort of lower energy and transportation and raw material costs kind of work their way through?\nMichael Larsen : We have a very small portion of our overall portfolio where the pricing is indexed to raw materials. If you add it all up, it's somewhere around 5% of our total revenue, so really an immaterial number, where it's an automatic giveback on price. I think on everything else, we historically command a premium given our -- the differentiated nature of our products and services and the quality of our delivery, and we expect to maintain that premium as we compete and focus on gaining market share. So that's how I'd answer your question, Steve.\nStephen Volkmann : Great. I appreciate it. Pretty minimal then. And then just sort of maybe the obligatory question on capital deployment relative to your thinking on any sort of further divestiture opportunities or M&A pipeline, anything to kind of call out there?\nMichael Larsen : Yes. So I think you saw the two divestitures here in the fourth quarter. That's part of -- I think we called out a handful of business units about a year ago. So the first two are done. We've got a smaller 1 that's kind of in the works. And then we've got a more meaningful one that is performing at a really high level right now. And I think we're going to kind of assess the capital markets and conditions and whether it's the right time to launch sometime this summer and that would kind of round out what we talked about a year ago. So that's kind of where we're at.\nStephen Volkmann : Great. And M&A pipeline, sorry.\nMichael Larsen : Well, yes, I mean, we get this question every time, we answer it the same way. I mean, I think organic growth is priority number one for all the reasons that Scott just talked about. I think -- we'd certainly be interested in high-quality acquisitions that accelerate the long-term growth potential of the company, where we can improve margins through the implementation of the business model and we can earn a reasonable rate of return on our shareholders' capital. And so MTS is a good example of an acquisition that checks all the boxes. That was a pretty big one that we did a year ago. And to the extent that other opportunities like that present themselves that check the boxes, we're definitely going to lean in, in a big way. So that's -- but...\nScott Santi : Yes, maybe just a little color on top of that, that's more sort of topical near term. What I would say generally is that we are not looking to acquire broken businesses, we're looking to acquire good businesses and help them be great businesses. And in environments where the sort of economic -- the macro is uncertain, those good businesses, it's really not a good time to sell. So if anything, I'd say the environment until the macro trajectory gets a little bit more clear, I would expect that the opportunities might be a little less than normal this year, at least through the first half, but we'll see.\nStephen Volkmann: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Donner of BMO Capital Markets.\nDan Donner : Excellent. Thank you. So the Food Equipment business, as you have highlighted, has definitely been a standout for you. And after attending the NAFEM Equipment Show yesterday, there's a noticeable difference in how the business seems to be presenting itself more cohesively than before. So will you comment on this aspect and also on some of the things that you're doing there with regard to consolidating sales reps and allocating more investments toward maybe the cooking side, specifically products like combi ovens and priors, which are certainly areas that have well-known large competitors?\nMichael Larsen : Well, I'll take a stab. I think we're not really doing anything different than we have over the last five years in the Food Equipment business. We've continued to invest in differentiated products, including the categories that you mentioned. And we've been putting up -- the team has been putting up some really great numbers as a result of executing on their strategy. And so if you add up the organic growth rate here, over 17% coming out of the pandemic 23% last year, this year, high single digit, double digit, and that's really as a result of us innovating and growing all product categories.\nScott Santi : And I add to that near term, our supply capabilities winning these businesses.\nMichael Larsen : Yes, definitely, I think this has been an area where kind of back to our win the Recovery positioning and the decision to carry enough inventory to service our customers with the same level of excellence in difficult supply chain on the different supply chain conditions has paid off in a big way. And so I think if you get the sense that the Food Equipment team is in a good mood. I think that's because they're gaining share and putting up some really strong numbers, including on the margin side, if you look at that almost 400 -- almost 500 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. So that business, like we said, has got a ton of momentum going into 2023, and we're very bullish on the future here.\nDan Donner : Okay. Thank you. Yes, they were definitely in a good mood.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start the Slide 4, where you show the 300 bps of outgrowth versus the proxy group over the last couple of years. Can you talk to attribution of that? And I think, obviously, a pricing environment where you've seen different trends across different companies, I'm not sure the degree to which maybe pricing is outpacing. But the degree to which it's volume is primarily share gain and just your confidence in the stickiness of those share gains as supply chain corrects?\nScott Santi : Yes. I guess I'll -- my response would be that there's no way that we can break this apart into various pieces. What I can say is that the proof is in the pudding. Ultimately, it's in the performance and our ability to consistently outperform. We're not claiming victory here. We're not -- we've got a lot of room to go across the company in terms of our ability to consistently deliver the kind of organic growth that we're capable of. But what we are saying is that we put a couple of years on the board, where we are growing our peers in the aggregate. Now what percent of that is our market exposures versus theirs or different approaches to pricing or supply capability? I'd say all of the above. In the end, it doesn't matter as long as we're able to consistently outgrow our peers and outgrow our markets and that's really the goal.\nJoe O'Dea : And I guess related to that, as you're seeing maybe supply chain ease, and I don't know if competitors are in the market in a little bit more competitive way. But any challenges now that you didn't see maybe 6 or 12 months ago?\nMichael Larsen : Yes, I think, Joe, from the beginning, the Win the Recovery positioning was all about strategic share gains focused primarily on our existing customers. And we were not interested in opportunistic onetime orders. And so we're pretty confident with that direction. These share gains are going to stick. I think the pandemic and the supply chain kind of disruptions were a great opportunity for ITW to demonstrate how differentiated our supply chain capabilities are for those customers that didn't know. And so I think that's been really -- that's what's contributing also to the outgrowth relative to peers. I mean that's one more element of the equation as you talked about with Scott.\nJoe O'Dea : And then I just wanted to clarify on the average daily sales plus 2% versus seasonal -- or plus 4% versus seasonal plus 2, the degree to which that's underlying demand accelerating versus maybe backlog burn. I think it's hard to parse given broadly inflated backlogs out there what underlying demand trends look like. But any comments on what you're seeing sort of underlying accelerate versus decel?\nMichael Larsen : Well, I think we're not a backlog-driven company. As you know, we don't carry a lot of backlog. And as you also say, it's hard to parse out what was backlog versus new orders. So I'm not sure I can give you a great answer. What I can tell you is that, typically, our sales per day go up by 2%. If you go back and look in time, and they went up by 4%. And so things are definitely not slowing. And we've got some great momentum going into Q1 and 2023.\nJoe O'Dea: Great. I appreciate the color. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell : Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe I just wanted to circle back to the organic sales growth guide and totally understand you don't take an elaborate macro gyration within that, and that's a very sensible approach. But you've got the 4% growth guide for the year as a whole organically at the midpoint. You just did low double digit the most recent quarter. So just want to understand how we think about that sort of step down. Is it a steady deceleration as we go through the year? Anything in particular we should bear in mind on one or two-year stacks? Any color at all really that you could give on and how we think about the plus four moving through 2023?\nMichael Larsen : It's all in the comparisons year-over-year, Julian. So like I said, we expect the year to play out from a revenue standpoint, in line with our typical cadence. And so Q1 starts out a little bit lower and then we kind of improve from there. But there's nothing baked in, in terms of a big acceleration in the back half or deceleration in the back half. We've kind of done our best here to model current levels of demand risk adjusted for the areas where we're seeing some slowing in demand and we come up with 3% to 5%. I think if you run the math, you'll see kind of the first half is the growth rates are maybe towards the higher end of that 3% to 5% and the second half is towards the lower end, and that's all driven by the comps on a year-over-year basis.\nJulian Mitchell : That's very clear. Thank you. And then within Construction products, I don't think we built with that one yet. Apologies if you have to repeat anything. But that's sort of down for guide for the year. There's a bit of price in there, some maybe volumes are down high single digit or something. But maybe just help us understand what's embedded within that? I think simplistically, you have 1/3 is resi new build, 1/3 is resi replacement, 1/3 is commercial. Those three big pieces, how are you sort of thinking about those this year? \nMichael Larsen : I mean the big driver, Julian, is the housing market, new housing. And so the residential side is about 80% of our business here in North America, and that's where we're seeing some slowing, which we've talked about since the summer, I think. So there's nothing new here. And that's the big driver here.\nScott Santi : The commercial side is hanging in there. As I said, it was also our strongest business in the summer after the pandemic.\nMichael Larsen : Right. I mean...\nScott Santi : Part of the advantage of the different end market exposures that we have. And we can -- we're always going to have some in the tailwind mode and some in the headwind mode, but the net mix of it all is pretty positive. So...\nMichael Larsen : Yes. It's going to be down a little this year, but it's also been a business that's really performed well for us when other parts of the macro have been challenged. So...\nJulian Mitchell: That makes sense. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The demand growth that we've experienced all year continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 8% with organic growth of 12%. On an equal day's basis, organic growth was 14% as the fourth quarter this year had one less shipping day compared to prior year.  We finished the year with strong growth momentum as evidenced by our sequential organic revenue growth of plus 4% from Q3 into Q4 on a sales per day basis as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%. By geography, every major region grew double digit, with North America up 13%, Europe up 11% and China up 10%.  Foreign currency translation headwind reduced revenue by 5%, and the net impact from acquisitions and divestitures was plus 1%. GAAP EPS grew 53% to $2.95 and included a $0.61 gain from two divestitures, which I'll provide more detail on in a moment. Excluding those gains, EPS increased 21% to $2.34, which included $0.12 of EPS headwind from foreign currency translation. So, on an apples-to-apples basis, eliminating both divestiture gains and currency headwind, EPS increased 27%. On the bottom line, operating income grew 18%, with strong incremental margin performance of 52% and operating margin improved 210 basis points to 24.8%. Operating margin in our base businesses, excluding MTS, was 25.2%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points. And as Scott said, this was the first quarter with favorable margin impact from price/cost since the third quarter of 2020.  Enterprise Initiatives contributed 110 basis points. As you saw in the press release, we completed two divestitures in the fourth quarter, resulting in a combined pretax gain on sale of $197 million recorded in nonoperating income and an EPS impact of $0.61. By utilizing capital loss carryforwards to offset taxes on the divestiture gains, the overall tax rate for the company was 19.1%. So overall, for Q4, excellent operational execution across the board, strong financial performance and what remains a pretty uncertain and volatile environment. Okay. Please turn to Slide 4, starting with our progress on organic growth. And as you know, we've been aggressively executing a very focused growth strategy to build consistent above-market organic growth into a core ITW strength on par with our operational 80/20 front-to-back capabilities.  As you can see from the data on the left side of the slide, ITW's 12% organic growth rate for each of the last two years compares favorably to our proxy peers at about 9% both years, suggesting that while we're not there yet in terms of realizing ITW's full potential organic growth performance, we're making some very solid progress. Moving on to the segment results, starting with Automotive OEM, which led the way with organic growth of 20%. Year-on-year revenue growth was, of course, helped by supply chain challenges in the industry last year. North America was up 15% and Europe grew 23%. China was up 17% with particularly strong growth in electric vehicles. On a full year basis, ITW Automotive OEM revenues were up 12% versus 6% growth in car builds. Looking forward, we expect Automotive OEM to grow 5% to 7% in 2023 based on a risk-adjusted auto build assumption in the low single digits plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3%. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered another very strong quarter with organic growth of 17%. North America grew 25% with double-digit growth in all major categories and end markets. Institutional was up more than 40% with strength across the board, restaurants were up 30% and retail grew 20%. International revenue grew 7%, with Europe up 9% and Asia Pacific was flat with some near-term softness in China.  The Food Equipment team also delivered excellent progress on margins, with Q4 operating margin of 27.6%, an increase of almost 500 basis points year-over-year. So obviously, strong momentum in this segment, and we expect Food Equipment to grow 8% to 10% in 2023. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 15%, with organic growth of 10%. Test & Measurement grew 12% organic, excluding the acquisition of MTS, with continued strong demand for capital equipment as evidenced by Instron, which grew 24%. Electronics was up 7%.  While our semi-related businesses, which represent combined annual revenues of about $550 million or approximately 20% of the segment, grew 17% in the quarter. We are beginning to see a slowdown in demand after three years of very strong growth. So, embedded in our 2023 organic growth projection of 2% to 4% for this segment is anticipated further slowing in semi-related end markets. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered strong organic growth of 15% in Q4, with equipment up 17% and consumables up 13%. Industrial sales remained very strong with organic growth of 25%. On the commercial side, which is more consumer-oriented, demand continued to slow and organic growth was down 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 15%, and international grew 17%, driven by strength in the oil and gas business, up 19%. Operating margin was up 160 basis points to 31.6%, a new record for the segment and for the company. Looking forward, we expect revenue to grow 5% to 7% in 2023, which includes some anticipated further slowing on the commercial Welding side. Polymers & Fluids delivered organic growth of 11%, with the automotive aftermarket business up 13% with some seasonal strength in wiper blades. Polymers grew 11% with continued strength in industrial applications, and Fluids was up 5%. North America grew 11% and international was up 10%. Looking forward, we expect Polymers & Fluids to grow 3% to 5% in 2023, which is based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in the more consumer-oriented automotive aftermarket business. Turning to Slide 7. Overall demand in Construction slowed to an organic growth rate of plus 4%. North America was still up 9%, with residential up 11% and commercial construction was down 6% due to a tough comparison of plus 21% last year. Europe was up 3% and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. As you know, Construction is our most interest rate sensitive segment, and we are projecting further slowing in 2023 and a negative organic growth rate of minus 5% to minus 3%. Specialty organic growth was 3% as supply chain shortages eased up in Q4, and the equipment businesses had a strong finish to the year with organic growth of 8%. Consumables were up 2%. And on a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international grew 7%. Looking forward, we expect Specialty organic revenue of negative 1% to plus 1% in 2023, which is based on current levels of demand and anticipated further slowing in the appliance components business. So, let's turn to Slide 8 for a recap of a very strong 2022. As throughout the year, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers, while responding quickly and decisively to rapidly rising input costs, navigating supply chain disruptions and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy.  As a result, for the full year, ITW grew organic revenue by 12% with double-digit growth in five of seven segments. And despite significant price/cost margin pressures and thanks in part to 90 basis points contribution from our enterprise initiatives, our base businesses expanded operating margin by 30 basis points to 24.4%. GAAP EPS of $9.77 was a record for ITW with EPS growth of 15% on top of 28% EPS growth in 2021. Excluding divestiture gains and negative currency translation impact, EPS grew 12% in 2022 on an apples-to-apples basis. In 2022, we also invested more than $700 million to accelerate organic growth and to sustain productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. Raised our dividend 7%, marking the 59th year of consecutive increases. Returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and made solid progress on the integration of a very high-quality acquisition in the MTS Test and Simulation business. And most importantly, we delivered these results while continuing to make meaningful progress on our path to ITW's full potential through the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy. So, let's move to Slide 9 for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. And while we certainly see some positives in terms of supply chain easing and moderating input cost inflation, there's also no doubt that the economic outlook and demand picture is becoming increasingly uncertain. On our last Q3 earnings call, we pointed to pockets of slowing demand at approximately 20% of our business portfolio. And today, we would add semiconductor-related end markets to the mix bringing the total to about 25% of ITW's portfolio.  In our view, it therefore made sense to take a more cautious approach to our top line guidance this year by basing it not just on current levels of demand, adjusted for seasonality as we typically do, but rather anticipating further slowing in end markets related to construction, commercial welding, auto aftermarket, appliances and semiconductor. As a result, our organic growth rate projection for 2023 of 3% to 5% is lower than our typical run rate approach. Operating margin is expected to improve by 100 basis points or more to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. This includes approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives and positive price/cost margin impact based on all known and implemented price and cost actions. After tax return on invested capital should improve to 30% plus, and we expect strong free cash flow with conversion greater than net income. For 2023, we expect GAAP EPS in the range of $9.40 to $9.80, which also includes $0.15 to $0.20 of higher interest expense on our short-term debt and $0.25 of increased income tax expense as our tax rate will revert to our normal, approximately 24% versus 22% in 2022, excluding the tax impacts from our divestitures. In terms of cadence for the year, we're now back to our typical first half, second half EPS split of 49% and 51%.  Our capital allocation plans for 2023 are consistent with our long-standing disciplined capital allocation framework. Our top priority remains internal investments to support our organic growth initiatives and sustain our highly profitable core businesses. The second priority is an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, which remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high-quality acquisitions, such as MTS, that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential and have significant margin improvement potential from the implication of our proprietary 80/20 front-to-back methodology and can generate acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital. And finally, surplus capital will be allocated to an active share repurchase program, and we expect to buy back approximately $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2023.  Turning to our last slide, Slide 10, for our 2023 organic growth projections by segment. And you can see that we're expecting solid to mid -- solid mid- to high single-digit organic growth in four of our seven segments, offsetting some lower growth rates in Test & Measurement and Electronics, which is due to semiconductor demand, as well as in Construction and Specialty resulting in an overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level of 3% to 5%, which is on top of 12% organic growth in each of the last two years. Overall, we're heading into 2023 with strong momentum, and we're very well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge as we move through 2023.  And so, with that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Okay. That was a lot there, Jamie. I'll do my best, okay? So, I think the color on semi is really the -- we're coming off a three year very strong growth cycle with growth in the high teens or better than that over those three years. And we are starting to see a slowdown in the order intake really in Q4.  So, it hasn't really showed up in our numbers in a meaningful way yet, but we do expect that to continue into 2023. We think it's more of a near-term slowdown. And like you said, that is the addition to the portfolio we've said before, 20% is slowing. Demand is slowing now. It's 25%, and semi is really the incremental 5% this quarter. But it's important to keep in mind that the balance, the other 75% of the portfolio, continues to perform at a really high level. And I'll just point to the 12% organic we put up in Q4 and for the full year. And then if you look at our guidance on Slide 10, by segment, you can see mid- to high single-digit growth in Automotive OEM, Food Equipment, Welding, mid-single digit in Polymers & Fluids and then a little bit lower in Test & Measurement. And then of course, Construction is the one that's a little bit projected to be down year-over-year and Specialty about flat. I'll also say, if you just look at from Q3 to Q4, we -- typically, our sales per day go up 2%, we actually went up 4%. So, we're more than offsetting some of the slowing that we're seeing in 25% of the portfolio. So good momentum, really well positioned going into next year. I think on the price/cost side, we were really encouraged. We talked about this on the last call and an expectation of being positive -- slightly positive on margins on price/cost in Q4. This was a little bit better, driven by both sides of the equation really price and cost, but it was certainly great to see that turn positive for the first time since I think I said the third quarter 2020. So, first time in eight quarters, so really encouraging heading into 2023. Thank you. Well, I think we are certainly lapping some bigger price numbers. There's no doubt about that. And I think, as you know, we don't break out price and volume separately for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. But there's both price and volume in the numbers that we've laid out for 2023. And the 3% to 5% organic, I'll just say it's a risk-adjusted number. If you do a pure run rate, you end up at a higher number. We just thought given the -- everything we talked about, it was probably reasonable to take a more cautious approach given the environment. Yes. I think that's reasonable. I think certainly materials and components in that order, we are seeing -- I wouldn't say price are coming -- costs are coming down in a significant way, and they're remaining at a fairly elevated level. And then I think on -- our labor costs, certainly we're experiencing the same labor cost inflation as others. But -- and so maybe a little bit higher than typical, but nothing really that significant. We're still expanding margins by 100 basis points or better here in 2023. So hopefully, that answers your question. Sure. Thank you, Scott. So Tami, like I said, we're kind of back to our typical cadence here. I think we said first half, 49% of our EPS for the full year; second half, 51%. We really -- if you go back unlike time, we've been remarkably consistent. Embedded in that is also the fact that Q1 is typically our lowest quarter in terms of revenue, and we're expecting somewhere in the mid-single-digit type growth. Margins will probably start out a little bit lower, but still 100 basis points of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And maybe just to give an additional data point, if you run the same data on Q1 contribution to EPS overall, it's somewhere around 23% of the full year, and that's a pretty -- the company has become remarkably predictable over the years. And so I think that's probably a pretty good estimate for how the first quarter might play out. So we just saw the January numbers and everything looks fine. Everything is tracking and really nothing different from what we talked about in the script here. So we're off to the start that we thought we would have. I think, Andy, we expect -- all of our planning here at ITW has done bottoms up, as I think you know. And every one of our segments, including the higher-margin ones, such as Welding as well as Automotive, which is really dealing with some near-term pressures primarily related to price cost as well as just volume leverage. Every one of our 7 segments told us that they expect to improve margins year-over-year in 2023. But obviously, the ones that have the higher growth rates are going to have more volume leverage and therefore, probably a more significant improvement in operating margin. But everybody will get better. I would just say on Automotive, it's going to take some time to recover the price/cost margin impact, which has been significantly higher in Automotive than in other segments for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. It takes a little bit longer to recover price.  So I think our current view is it will take us maybe two to three years to get back to automotive margins in the low to mid-20s. And so that's maybe how I would -- we would characterize it. Well... Okay. Well, I think we're in the tenth year now. I think if you add up the combined savings, it's approaching $1.5 billion of structural cost out from 80/20 and from strategic sourcing. And when we rolled up the plans here in November and check back in, in January and had a chance to review all the projects and activities that go into delivering these 100 basis points, we were really encouraged by what we saw. And so I know that for a couple of years, we've been saying -- I've been saying this is not going to go on forever, and I... And I was wrong, which happens a lot. But I think, ultimately, look, I think if you model ITW long term, I'd go back to the TSR model we've given you, which is 4% plus organic growth, incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range. Then operating income grew $7 million. You add acquisitions and buybacks on top of that. And so EPS grows 9% to 10%, and you add an attractive dividend in that 2% to 3% range. 2% to 3% range on top of it, you get 11% to 13% over the long term, that's what you should expect us to deliver. And so I think I have to say, to give you a definite and on enterprise initiatives because, as Scott reminded me, I've been wrong for many years. But that's probably how I would think about it, Andy. Right. I think we've said this before. I mean, this proprietary ITW business model is more powerful than it's ever been as we sit here today. It's much different from 10 years ago, 3 years ago. And we are applying it. Our people, we've all gotten better at applying these methodologies, and we're applying it to a much more differentiated portfolio. And so as long as we continue down that path, I think it is -- I agree with Scott. I don't think it's going to end any time soon. So that's probably how we've set it up. Well, I think maybe what would be helpful, Sabrina, is just -- let me just give you some of the elements here that go into the margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I'm going to use round numbers here, okay? So if we just ended 2022 at operating margins of about 24%, you should expect volume leverage somewhere in the 50 to 100 basis points of positive contribution to margins year-over-year, the enterprise initiatives, which is sized at about 100. We're certainly going to make some good progress on price/cost as 70 basis points was encouraging in Q4. I think the -- if that's the run rate going into 2023, maybe a little bit better than that. Let's just say price/cost adds approximately 100 basis points based on what we know today. And then the offset to some of this is our typical kind of -- we talked about this a little bit, wages and inflation on wages. We are bringing in some new hires to support our organic growth efforts. We are investing in driving organic growth, including capacity. And so that's typically a headwind of less than 100 basis points. That's running a little bit higher, just given the underlying inflation that's in the system that's probably running at 150 to 200. And so you add all that up, you get 100 basis points plus of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis. And I think that's a pretty good number, Sabrina. Well, I think, as we look at kind of on a geographic basis, including China, most of our regions are kind of in that mid-single digits for the year. And China is maybe a little bit higher than that. A big driver, as you pointed out, in China is really the Automotive business, where we continue to make a lot of progress in terms of market share and penetration gains. So that's certainly our largest business and also the biggest driver of our growth in China next year. And so if the total company is 3% to 5% organic, China is certainly a little bit higher than that in our current projections as we sit here today. So... We have a very small portion of our overall portfolio where the pricing is indexed to raw materials. If you add it all up, it's somewhere around 5% of our total revenue, so really an immaterial number, where it's an automatic giveback on price. I think on everything else, we historically command a premium given our -- the differentiated nature of our products and services and the quality of our delivery, and we expect to maintain that premium as we compete and focus on gaining market share. So that's how I'd answer your question, Steve. Yes. So I think you saw the two divestitures here in the fourth quarter. That's part of -- I think we called out a handful of business units about a year ago. So the first two are done. We've got a smaller 1 that's kind of in the works. And then we've got a more meaningful one that is performing at a really high level right now. And I think we're going to kind of assess the capital markets and conditions and whether it's the right time to launch sometime this summer and that would kind of round out what we talked about a year ago. So that's kind of where we're at. Well, yes, I mean, we get this question every time, we answer it the same way. I mean, I think organic growth is priority number one for all the reasons that Scott just talked about. I think -- we'd certainly be interested in high-quality acquisitions that accelerate the long-term growth potential of the company, where we can improve margins through the implementation of the business model and we can earn a reasonable rate of return on our shareholders' capital. And so MTS is a good example of an acquisition that checks all the boxes. That was a pretty big one that we did a year ago. And to the extent that other opportunities like that present themselves that check the boxes, we're definitely going to lean in, in a big way. So that's -- but... Well, I'll take a stab. I think we're not really doing anything different than we have over the last five years in the Food Equipment business. We've continued to invest in differentiated products, including the categories that you mentioned. And we've been putting up -- the team has been putting up some really great numbers as a result of executing on their strategy. And so if you add up the organic growth rate here, over 17% coming out of the pandemic 23% last year, this year, high single digit, double digit, and that's really as a result of us innovating and growing all product categories. Yes, definitely, I think this has been an area where kind of back to our win the Recovery positioning and the decision to carry enough inventory to service our customers with the same level of excellence in difficult supply chain on the different supply chain conditions has paid off in a big way. And so I think if you get the sense that the Food Equipment team is in a good mood. I think that's because they're gaining share and putting up some really strong numbers, including on the margin side, if you look at that almost 400 -- almost 500 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. So that business, like we said, has got a ton of momentum going into 2023, and we're very bullish on the future here. Yes, I think, Joe, from the beginning, the Win the Recovery positioning was all about strategic share gains focused primarily on our existing customers. And we were not interested in opportunistic onetime orders. And so we're pretty confident with that direction. These share gains are going to stick. I think the pandemic and the supply chain kind of disruptions were a great opportunity for ITW to demonstrate how differentiated our supply chain capabilities are for those customers that didn't know. And so I think that's been really -- that's what's contributing also to the outgrowth relative to peers. I mean that's one more element of the equation as you talked about with Scott. Well, I think we're not a backlog-driven company. As you know, we don't carry a lot of backlog. And as you also say, it's hard to parse out what was backlog versus new orders. So I'm not sure I can give you a great answer. What I can tell you is that, typically, our sales per day go up by 2%. If you go back and look in time, and they went up by 4%. And so things are definitely not slowing. And we've got some great momentum going into Q1 and 2023. It's all in the comparisons year-over-year, Julian. So like I said, we expect the year to play out from a revenue standpoint, in line with our typical cadence. And so Q1 starts out a little bit lower and then we kind of improve from there. But there's nothing baked in, in terms of a big acceleration in the back half or deceleration in the back half. We've kind of done our best here to model current levels of demand risk adjusted for the areas where we're seeing some slowing in demand and we come up with 3% to 5%. I think if you run the math, you'll see kind of the first half is the growth rates are maybe towards the higher end of that 3% to 5% and the second half is towards the lower end, and that's all driven by the comps on a year-over-year basis. I mean the big driver, Julian, is the housing market, new housing. And so the residential side is about 80% of our business here in North America, and that's where we're seeing some slowing, which we've talked about since the summer, I think. So there's nothing new here. And that's the big driver here. Right. I mean... Yes. It's going to be down a little this year, but it's also been a business that's really performed well for us when other parts of the macro have been challenged. So..."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, in Q4, we delivered a strong finish to a year of high-quality execution in the face of some pretty unique challenges in the operating environment. Starting with the top line organic growth, was 12% as all segments delivered positive organic growth, and five of our seven segments grew double digits, led by Auto OEM, up 20%, Food Equipment, up 17%, Welding, up 15%, Polymers & Fluids, up 11% and Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 10%. Construction Products was up 4%, and Specialty Products was up 3%. Operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 24.8%, with 110 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives and favorable price/cost margin impact of 70 basis points, which was for the first time in nine quarters -- which was favorable for the first time in nine quarters.  Incremental margin was 52%, and operating income grew 18%. GAAP earnings per share increased 53% to a record $2.95, including $0.61 of gains from divestitures and $0.12 of negative currency -- excluding $0.61, sorry, of divestiture gains and $0.12 of negative currency EPS growth was 27%. For all of 2022, the company delivered organic growth of 12% for the second year in a row, best-in-class operating margin of 24.4% in our base business, after-tax return on invested capital of 29.1% and record GAAP EPS of $9.77, an increase of 15% versus the prior year.  There's no question that our decision to stay invested in our enterprise strategy and then our people throughout the pandemic and the quality of our team's execution of our when the recovery focus coming out of it are powering the strong growth and financial performance, ITW is currently delivering. As a result, we are very pleased with our momentum and positioning heading into 2023. Turning to our 2023 guidance. Demand remained solid across the majority of our portfolio, and we are seeing meaningful improvements in supply chain performance and moderating input cost inflation. At the same time, there's no question that the economic outlook, let's call it, remains certainly dynamic. As a result, our organic growth projection for 2023 of 3% to 5% and our EPS guidance of $9.60 at the midpoint reflect current levels of demand and a risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. And Michael will provide more detail on that in just a minute. Before I turn it over to Michael, I want to again thank my ITW colleagues around the world for their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence.  Michael, over to you. Thank you. Yes, go ahead, you start. We were wrong. I would just add in terms of perspective that I think one of the real strengths of our operating methodology and our business model is it's there's no one definition of perfection. There is always room to get better. We use the business model as the core tool that our 84 divisions used to identify and prioritize opportunities to get better. And I don't see that stopping for quite a while. Yes. First of all, Jeff, thank you for noticing. The -- what I would say in terms of just the arc of the last decade, we've been on this is that clearly, for the first five to seven years, we had a lot more work to do inside the businesses to get ourselves in position to grow. And what we're delivering now is much more about businesses that are from an operational standpoint, a lot closer to 80% or 90% of their potential. And so a lot of -- which allows a lot of our effort and attention and just to be reallocated to commercial opportunities to grow. And that's ultimately what is showing up now. We have a lot more sort of energy collectively being devoted to growth opportunities because we've gotten the internal -- the operational position of these businesses firing in sort of in a really strong position. And so it's -- you can't be great at everything all at once. It's part of, I think, what we would reflect that over the last decade and one of the real secrets to the outcomes we've delivered in my view is that we've been focused on the right things at the right time and have not tried to do too much at any stage. But we're clearly now at a stage where organic growth is the 80 of what we've got opportunities to do and what we've got to deliver on going forward. And I think that's reflected in the numbers that we're currently throwing off. That's exactly the way we do it. We are self-funding our growth investments through our incremental margin contribution. So at the 35 historical and targeted run rate, that is -- that includes -- that's after those incremental investments in growth. We're investing in capacity now in a really significant way in headcount in the areas that help us grow and supporting innovation. And we're still going to deliver of 100 bps of margin improvement next year. So that just illustrates the point of these businesses are so profitable that every incremental dollar of revenue that we generate organically drives a lot of incremental cash flow and certainly to support that we're going to invest some of that, but it doesn't impair our belief that we're in a good chunk of it to the bottom line. Yes, maybe just a little color on top of that, that's more sort of topical near term. What I would say generally is that we are not looking to acquire broken businesses, we're looking to acquire good businesses and help them be great businesses. And in environments where the sort of economic -- the macro is uncertain, those good businesses, it's really not a good time to sell. So if anything, I'd say the environment until the macro trajectory gets a little bit more clear, I would expect that the opportunities might be a little less than normal this year, at least through the first half, but we'll see. And I add to that near term, our supply capabilities winning these businesses. Yes. I guess I'll -- my response would be that there's no way that we can break this apart into various pieces. What I can say is that the proof is in the pudding. Ultimately, it's in the performance and our ability to consistently outperform. We're not claiming victory here. We're not -- we've got a lot of room to go across the company in terms of our ability to consistently deliver the kind of organic growth that we're capable of. But what we are saying is that we put a couple of years on the board, where we are growing our peers in the aggregate. Now what percent of that is our market exposures versus theirs or different approaches to pricing or supply capability? I'd say all of the above. In the end, it doesn't matter as long as we're able to consistently outgrow our peers and outgrow our markets and that's really the goal. The commercial side is hanging in there. As I said, it was also our strongest business in the summer after the pandemic. Part of the advantage of the different end market exposures that we have. And we can -- we're always going to have some in the tailwind mode and some in the headwind mode, but the net mix of it all is pretty positive. So..."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to ITW\u2019s third quarter 2022 conference call. I am joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s third quarter financial results and our updated guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3 and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thanks, Karen and good morning, everyone. In what remains a very dynamic and challenging operating environment, we were pleased with our Q3 performance. On the top line, we delivered 13% revenue growth with 16% organic growth from our base businesses. While we did see some softening in channel inventory reduction actions in our businesses serving the construction, auto aftermarket, commercial welding and appliance markets, five of our seven segments delivered double-digit organic growth, led by automotive OEM, up 25% and food equipment, up 23%. With regard to margins, we were glad to see our incremental margins in Q3 return to our normal 30% plus level for the first time in five quarters as the impact of volume growth, enterprise initiatives, pricing actions and some moderation in the pace of input cost inflation drove incremental margin of 39% and a 130 basis point improvement in operating margin in our base businesses. We have lost roughly 250 basis points of margin due to price/cost during this period of rapid inflation, which we fully expect to recover over time once the current inflationary environment stabilizes and it was certainly good to see a nice solid first step in that direction in Q3. On the bottom line, strong growth and margin performance resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.35, up 16% versus Q3 of last year and that 16% growth includes $0.13 of negative impact from currency. Excluding currency, earnings per share were up 23%. Looking at our current performance, our decision to stay invested in our long-term strategy and in our people during the pandemic and the quality of our team\u2019s execution of our recovery strategy coming out of it are fueling the strong organic growth and financial performance that we are currently delivering. While the economic outlook is becoming increasingly uncertain, demand remains solid across the majority of our business portfolio. And as a result, the company is well positioned to deliver a strong finish to what has been a very strong year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Michael who will provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. In Q3, revenue grew 13% to $4 billion, with strong organic growth of 16%. The MTS acquisition contributed 3% to revenue. Foreign currency translation was a 6% headwind compared to a 4% headwind last quarter. And despite $0.13 of year-over-year EPS headwind from foreign currency translation, GAAP EPS was $2.35, an increase of 16%. Excluding MTS, incremental margin in our base business was 39%, which as Scott said, was a welcome return to our normal historical incremental margin rates. As a result of our strong revenue and margin performance, operating income increased 16% to $983 million, which was an all-time quarterly record. Operating margin was 24.5%, with operating leverage of almost 300 basis points and 110 basis points of enterprise initiatives. Excluding 60 basis points of margin impact from the MTS acquisition, operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 25.1%. Free cash flow was solid at $612 million, an increase of 46% versus Q2 and 12% year-over-year. The conversion rate of 84% is lower than our typical Q3 performance as we remain committed in the near term to intentional working capital investments to support double-digit organic growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers. Finally, share repurchases in Q3 were $500 million and our effective tax rate was 24% versus 21% in the prior year. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 and starting with organic growth by geography. We delivered growth in the mid-teens across all major geographies, led by North America up 17%. Europe, which represents about 23% of our sales, grew 14%, led by automotive OEM up 26% and food equipment, up 15%. China grew 15%, led by Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 32% and automotive OEM was up 29%. Price/cost was accretive to income in Q3 and slightly dilutive by 40 basis points to margin. As we have said before, our business teams around the world have done an exceptional job of adjusting price to offset cost increases throughout the most significant inflationary cycle in over 40 years. And should the pace of raw material cost inflation continue to moderate, we expect price/cost to be accretive to income and slightly accretive to margin in Q4. As Scott mentioned, throughout this unprecedented 2-year inflationary cycle, the company has absorbed as much as 250 basis points of margin dilution impact from price/cost, which we expect to fully recover of the succeeding six to eight quarters after input prices stabilize. Moving on to the segments. Automotive OEM delivered strong organic growth of 25%, with North America up 21% and Europe up 26%. China was up 29%, which included some sequential recovery from the lockdown impact in Q2. When looking at these year-over-year growth rates, keep in mind that the comparisons are against the Q3 last year when the chip shortage led to a low point for auto production. We continue to make good progress on our content per vehicle growth as evidenced by our year-to-date organic growth rate of 9% compared to auto builds of 7%, in line with our long-term market outgrowth target of 2 to 3 percentage points. Consistent with our guidance all year, we do not expect a meaningful improvement in the chip shortage situation impacting automotive production until next year. And we continue to take a more conservative approach to our guidance, which assumes that automotive production essentially remains around current levels through the balance of this year. And as we have said before, as supply chain issues eventually get resolved down the road, we remain confident that the automotive OEM segment is well positioned to be a very meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise for an extended period of time. And as that plays out, we also expect that the automotive OEM segment returns to its typical historical operating margin rates in the low to mid-20s. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered strong organic growth of 23% as North America grew 30% with double-digit growth in every major category and end market. Growth in institutional markets was 50% plus with strength across several categories, most notably lodging. Restaurants were up around 40% and retail growth was in the mid-teens. International revenue grew 14% with Europe up 15% and Asia Pacific up 9%. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 29%, with organic growth of 17% as Test & Measurement grew 20% and Electronics was up 14%. Growth was broad-based with continued strength in semiconductor and CapEx spending as evidenced by organic growth of 13% in the Instron business. Moving on to Slide 6, welding grew 14% organically, with equipment up 13% and consumables up 15%. Industrial was the standout with organic growth of 32%. The commercial side of the welding business, which sells to smaller businesses and individual users, was down 10% due to lower demand and inventory destocking in the channel. However, due to the strength on the industrial side, North America still grew 14% and international grew 12%. Sales to oil and gas customers were up 12% in the quarter. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 31.5%, which was a new record for the Welding segment. Polymers & Fluids grew 8% organically, with Polymers up 21% on continued strength in industrial applications. Softening demand due to higher gas prices and the impact on consumer discretionary spend impacted the automotive aftermarket business, which was up 2%. Fluids was up 5% and overall North America grew 5%, international was up 14%. Construction delivered organic growth of 17% with continued strength in North America, which was up 35%. U.S. residential grew 42% and commercial was up 17%. That said, we did see some signs of slowing towards the end of the quarter and we expect that to continue in Q4, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. The international side of construction is slowing, with Europe down 1%. Australia and New Zealand was up 7% against an easy comparison. Specialty growth was essentially flat as product line simplification activities resulted in the elimination of a product line in one of our consumer packaging businesses. Excluding PLS, the segment would have been up 3%. Demand in our appliance components division slowed, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. On a geographic basis, North America was down 2% and international grew 4%. Looking on Slide 8 for an update on the year and starting with the top line, we are raising our full year organic growth guidance to 11% to 12% due to the strength of our Q3 organic growth performance and projecting current levels of demand, which remains strong across most of our businesses. But we are also anticipating further slowing in the end markets we talked about, including global residential construction, automotive aftermarket, commercial welding and appliance components, that combined represent about 20% of total company revenue. The MTS acquisition is expected to add 3% to revenue and at current exchange rates, currency translation will reduce revenue by 5%, resulting in total revenue for the year up 9% to 10%. For Q4, we are well positioned to deliver a strong finish to a very strong year with organic growth of approximately 10% and GAAP EPS growth of about 40%. In Q4 and consistent with our previously announced plan to divest certain business units, we completed the sale of a division within the Polymers & Fluids segment, with an estimated after-tax gain of $0.45 per share. We have included this Q4 gain in our updated full year guidance. And per our usual process, we have narrowed the range for the year with one quarter to go and updated our guidance to reflect current foreign exchange rates, which results in additional foreign currency headwind versus our prior guidance. So as a result of including the gain on sale and updating guidance with current foreign exchange rates, our updated full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $9.45 to $9.55. We are projecting operating margin of approximately 24% for the full year, which includes approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives, about 200 basis points contribution from volume leverage and estimated 100 basis points of negative margin impact from price/cost and about 50 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisition of MTS. We expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, which, as we have talked about, is below our typical 100% plus conversion rate due to the intentional near-term working capital investments that support the company\u2019s double-digit revenue growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustained customer service levels. And finally, share repurchases are now expected to be $1.75 billion for the full year, an increase of $250 million versus prior guidance. Looking forward, we are obviously not immune to the macro challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead. But through the execution of our enterprise strategy, we have positioned this company to deliver top-tier results in any environment, as reflected in our differentiated performance at the depth of the pandemic and in the very dynamic and challenging conditions that have characterized the recovery over the last 2 years. We remain confident that the combination of the powerful competitive advantages we derive from ITW\u2019s proprietary business model, our high-quality business portfolio and our team\u2019s proven ability to consistently execute at a very high level ahead well prepared to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge in 2023 and beyond. With that, Karen, I will turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Michael. Rob let\u2019s open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Good morning, Scott and Michael and Karen.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nScott Davis: I am not very good at math, but just thinking through this with your guidance on the full year on price/cost, I think it implies that you are actually going to be in meaningful positive territory on price/cost in Q4. Is that \u2013 am I reading that right?\nMichael Larsen: That is correct. So we are going \u2013 we\u2019re expecting that if inflation stays where it is, and so based on the known increases and decreases and based on the price that we expect to realize in the fourth quarter, that price/cost will be accretive on an EPS basis and also, for the first time in a while, accretive on a margin basis as well.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And how do you \u2013 I mean, it seems like we\u2019re walking into a construction recession, but how do you guys \u2013 I mean, are you planning \u2013 how do you plan for that, given 80/20 and just the business model that you have? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to go do a bunch of restructuring. But how do you get ahead of that so that you can limit the impact of it?\nScott Santi: Well, we\u2019ve talked about this before, but one of the fundamental elements of 80/20 is that we are \u2013 that we have a very flexible cost structure. So we are \u2013 we do a lot of outsourcing upstream. We want to assemble. We want to control the manufacturing elements that really matter from the standpoint of control of quality-controlled delivery. But we don\u2019t necessarily have to bend all the metal. We don\u2019t have to necessarily do all the upstream work. And so what that gets us fundamentally, in fact, we prefer not to, and what ultimately that gives us is a relatively flexible cost structure. So we are a read and react company. Our businesses are going to respond to whatever the demand is that sits right in front of them. We\u2019ve talked about that before. We don\u2019t do a lot of forward forecasting. We are producing today what our customers bought yesterday. And as demand rates start to decline in places like construction, then those adjustments will take place real time.\nScott Davis: Okay, that\u2019s a helpful reminder. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Good luck.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. How are you?\nScott Santi: Good. Good morning.\nTami Zakaria: So I have two quick ones. The first one is, can you comment on which end markets you\u2019re anticipating for this slowdown? Meaning the 10% implied fourth quarter organic growth, are you currently run-rating above that but you\u2019re anticipating further slowdown and hence, you\u2019re guiding to about 10%?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, that\u2019s correct. So this is not our typical run rate. This has been adjusted with some anticipated further slowing in the end markets that we talked about.\nTami Zakaria: Are you able to share like what the current run rate is?\nMichael Larsen: It is higher than the 10%.\nTami Zakaria: Got it, got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the second one, can you comment on the price versus volume you saw in the third quarter? Because the last time you raised organic growth guidance earlier this year, I think you had mentioned that you saw some volume pickup. Did that sustain? Like what\u2019s the expectation for price versus volume in the fourth quarter?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So as you know, Tami, we don\u2019t report price and volume separately. But what I think we can tell you is that we are seeing, in Q3, we saw meaningful volume growth across the company, including particularly in \u2013 if you look at the strength in Auto, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, you\u2019re not going to put out numbers like that without a meaningful contribution from volume.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. And you expect volume to sort of sustain in most of these end markets in the fourth quarter as well?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think that\u2019s the reason. Obviously, this is a very dynamic environment but there is a lot of strength in the businesses that I just talked about that more than offset some of the slowing we\u2019re seeing at about 20% of the company. So I think we\u2019re really well positioned for a strong finish here in Q4. And if you look at the implied guidance, we\u2019re looking at organic growth, like we said, double digit. We\u2019re looking at margin improvement of more than 100 basis points, GAAP EPS growth of 40%, 15% excluding the divestiture gain that we talked about earlier. So a really strong finish to what\u2019s been a very strong year for the company.\nTami Zakaria: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nScott Santi: Hi, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Scott, maybe just focusing on construction for a second, last quarter, you mentioned some potential incremental weakness in Europe and Australia. It seems like those are hanging in there. Obviously, North American residential up 42%, you talked about a little bit of weakening. So is this just strong share gains for ITW that have held up these businesses within construction? I know you mentioned you saw some slowing late in the quarter. Maybe give us more color to the rate of that slowing going forward?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think what we\u2019ve seen is primarily a slowdown on the residential side, which is about 80% of our business. And we talked about softening on the international side here on our call last quarter. And so we did see Europe down 1%. I think that\u2019s pretty broad-based, UK, Continental Europe at this point, given some of the challenges, that\u2019s probably what you would expect. Australia and New Zealand is also slowing here. And as the comps get a little more difficult, you\u2019re going to see those growth rates start to come down. I think in North America, there is still a fair bit of, obviously, strength in the business. And then late in the quarter, we\u2019re really starting to see the order rates starting to come down on the residential side, so\u2026\nScott Santi: Yes, I think the only thing I would add is that it is among the most interest rate-sensitive end markets that we serve. And so you\u2019re seeing in the housing start data and a lot of other things that the rapid pace of interest rates rising is certainly starting to bite in the housing market. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll just point to the fact that it remains a very strong, very profitable business for us, and it points to just the value of the diversified portfolio is we\u2019re going to see some pressure in some places, but we\u2019ve got plenty of other places that are more than picking up and that\u2019s really by design. That\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to position the company ultimately to outperform in any environment.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Totally understand. And then maybe just backing up, what you\u2019re seeing across your industrial businesses, I mean, you talked a lot about the consumer businesses. Obviously, most of those businesses in the 20% are consumer facing. Have you seen any incremental weakness in your CapEx type businesses? Are they generally holding up?\nScott Santi: Not yet.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good enough. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: So nice to see the incremental margins ex MTS come back. Just given the comments that you\u2019re making around price/cost and turning positive, if inflation kind of holds at these levels and we\u2019re closer to peak inflation, would you expect to continue to achieve the same type of incremental margins going forward?\nMichael Larsen: I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that our incremental margins will be a little bit higher than our normal range, just given the recovery on price/cost that we talked about. So assuming again, Joe, that from an inflation side that things stay where they are or continue to moderate, then that would be a reasonable expectation.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, okay. Great. And then you mentioned, Michael, that 23% of your business in Europe, obviously, there is a lot of concern out there as we head into the winter on rising energy costs and potential recession in the region. I know that you guys have given already some color around trend, but just maybe anything else that you can kind of tell us about that region and then specifically from a cost perspective, how that impacts your business?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I mean, I think there is certainly a reason to be a little bit more concerned about Europe, just if you look at the macro picture. I think the fact is our businesses are performing at a really high level right now. And so if you just look at Q3, I\u2019ll just go back to a little bit of commentary on Europe specifically. We had six segments growing between 9% and 26%, and so double-digit growth in five of the seven segments and only construction was down 1%. And it\u2019s not all Auto. If you take out Auto, Europe still grew 10%. I think obviously, we expect those growth rates to moderate here in the fourth quarter. But I think we\u2019re really well positioned in Europe to deal with, just like the rest of the company, deal with whatever that\u2019s ahead. And if we have a little bit more softness maybe in Europe, maybe we have a little more strength in other parts of the world, and that\u2019s kind of how the company is set up, as Scott said. So we will read and react. We will deal with whatever is ahead of us, but we\u2019re confident that we will continue to outperform on a relative basis.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question, I know on the top line, you addressed the trends that you were seeing in construction. I was surprised a little bit on the margin in the quarter. So if you could first provide a little color around that, that would be helpful. And then I\u2019ll...\nMichael Larsen: Yes, Jamie, it\u2019s all price/cost in construction so a little bit more headwind here than in some of the other parts of the company. And so I will also say that 25.7% operating margin in construction is not too shabby at this point. So \u2013 but still, you\u2019re right. Relative to prior year, we\u2019re down due to the price/cost dynamic.\nJamie Cook: Okay. And then I know you didn\u2019t want to answer in terms of as we\u2019re thinking about the organic growth, which surprised on the upside. I know you don\u2019t want to answer what you\u2019re seeing in terms of price versus volume, but is there any update you can provide on which segments you\u2019re seeing the most success in terms of gaining market share and how sustainable you think this market share is going forward? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think from the beginning in terms of the \u2013 so one, we\u2019re confident that we are gaining market share across the portfolio and the kind of the guidance was only strategic long-term market share gains and not opportunistic kind of one-time orders from new customers. So we\u2019ve really focused on serving our 80 customers, as we call them, our best customers better than anybody else. And because of our win the recovery positioning, we are doing that and as a result of that gaining market share. I mean, it\u2019s hard to \u2013 we have 83 divisions so it\u2019s hard to point to specific areas. But if you just look at our overall at the enterprise level, organic growth of 16% in the third quarter, I think relative to other industrial companies that will probably compare pretty well.\nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Can you talk about the raw materials and sourced components waiting within COGS? And then sort of what you anticipate in terms of the timing of seeing each of those start to sort of flow through with maybe a more favorable situation in the P&L?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So if I understand your question, so we\u2019re currently running at about 3 months on hand. We\u2019re typically running at 2 months on hand in terms of inventory. And as supply conditions here begin to normalize and we\u2019re going to see a return to normal levels in that 2 months on hand. When exactly that happens is difficult to predict, but we are starting to see some signs that supply chain is improving. So I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that once conditions normalize, that it will take us about six to eight quarters to get back to 2 months on hand. And obviously, just like our conversion rate is below our historical typical levels at this point, they are going to be above for that period of time as we benefit from significant working capital release. When exactly that plays out is difficult to say. It\u2019s not all going to come back in one quarter. I mean, we\u2019ve built this up over 2 years. It\u2019s going to take some time to get it back out again. But we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve added the right level of inventory, and it\u2019s really put us in a great position to serve our customers, mitigate supply chain risk and, like we said, take market share.\nScott Santi: I think just \u2013 I think the question was more in terms of our cost of goods, what percentage of those are material costs.\nMichael Larsen: Correct.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Just kind of \u2013 yes. So all that was helpful. And I guess related to this, just with raw mats coming right, will raw mats flow through perfectly\u2026\nScott Santi: Okay. I think\u2026\nJoe O\u2019Dea: I think as components that you source, will you get cost down on that or do you think that\u2019s a trickier dynamic?\nScott Santi: Well, there is a lot of factors that go into the last part of your question. I think the simple answer on your first 1 is that the percentage of material as the \u2013 material cost percentage as an overall versus the overall COGS is going to vary. But let\u2019s just say, roughly 60%, 65%, 35% freight labor, other elements of the cost structure if that helps.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Yes, okay. And then I wanted to ask one about the fourth quarter margin, excluding the divestiture. I\u2019m getting something like a 50 basis point sequential decline from 3Q to 4Q. If that\u2019s accurate, can you just help with the bridge? I assume there is a little bit of sort of sequential decremental on lower revenue, but then price/cost should be more favorable. Just any other items to kind of consider in that bridge?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think if you look at it historically, we typically \u2013 Q3 is our highest quarter and we go down in Q4. The primary driver is that there is just less shipping days in the fourth quarter. So I think this year, there are 61 shipping days in Q4. There were 64 in the third quarter and so that\u2019s really the main driver here. On EPS, obviously, implied is slightly lower than what we just did in Q3. And the delta there is the foreign exchange piece.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify on the construction side of things, you mentioned the slowing in Q4 on the U.S. residential piece. But I didn\u2019t hear any follow-up comments on the commercial piece. Is that expected to slow too?\nMichael Larsen: Well, usually, residential is kind of the leading indicator. So, we just haven\u2019t seen it yet.\nScott Santi: On the commercial?\nMichael Larsen: Yes.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. So, maybe that would be something more like a 2023. I guess related to that, have you done any analysis to kind of look at the various stimulus programs that have been put in place and kind of to assess how that might end up flowing through your businesses?\nMichael Larsen: No, we haven\u2019t really. If you have any great idea, send them over. But we are a short-cycle company. We read and react what\u2019s in front of us, and trying to predict what the government is going to do, I think has not really been a winning equation for us anyway. It may work well for others but not in our case.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And just one clarification maybe on the last question about the margin in Q4. I guess are there any particular segments that you anticipate margins actually improving in the fourth quarter or any that stand out kind of one direction or the other?\nMichael Larsen: I think the fourth quarter looks a lot like the third quarter, except the organic growth rates are coming down. And so from a margin standpoint, it\u2019s pretty close to the third quarter.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann: Hey. Good morning guys. Sorry, maybe beating a bit of a dead horse here. But I just wanted to make sure I get this right because it feels like there is a lot of declining prices in various inputs from commodities to transportation, even energy. Are you seeing any of your input costs actually declining yet?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, we are. I mean we saw a meaningful decline here in Q3 from Q2, and we expect to see the same thing in Q4.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just curious, can you update us on where you are with the various divestitures? Is there \u2013 should we be expecting more here? Are you kind of ramping that back up or is it just kind of whenever it happens?\nMichael Larsen: I think there is maybe one more potentially here in the near-term. And then we will have to assess the remainder and whether now is a good time to move forward with those. But I think our views haven\u2019t changed in terms of the portfolio and the raw material that we need in order to continue to deliver the type of results that we are delivering. And so we have about a handful of businesses that we had flagged for potential divestiture. We just completed one. Maybe one more to go and then the balance, we will kind of reassess in the New Year.\nStephen Volkmann: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe one element I just wanted to dial into again was around sort of inventories and the cash flow outlook. So, the conversion only around, I think 80% now this year, which is obviously somewhere below your very high standards. I think Michael, you were quite guarded as to the pace of when that cash flow conversion comes back up. So, maybe help us understand how you see inventories at the customer level, the pace of your own inventory liquidation and how you are thinking about capital spending within the cash flow.\nScott Santi: Yes. I will maybe start on the first part with regard to inventory, and that is that we haven\u2019t seen enough stability yet on the supply chain side to make us comfortable that we can start backing off. So, our first priority is to preserve our ability to serve our customers. And so at this point, we are still in the mode of keeping the inventories where they are. As we start to see things become more, let\u2019s call it, reliable and consistent there, then we will certainly start making a move. But as of right now, we have \u2013 we are not in the mood of \u2013 in the mode of starting to reduce inventories.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, obviously. So, it\u2019s not a matter of whether or not we are going to benefit from working capital coming back down to normal levels. That we are sure of, we just don\u2019t know when. And in the near-term, we are absolutely committed to what Scott talked about, which is intentional working capital, including inventory to support double-digit growth and significant market share gains. So, we will update you if and when that changes. And then we will let you know what we think exactly the \u2013 how it might play out from a free cash flow standpoint.\nScott Santi: And there is a question on CapEx.\nMichael Larsen: Well, CapEx, I mean I think we have always funded every good project inside of the company, including during the pandemic, and I think that\u2019s going to continue. We are really fortunate that we are not a capital-intensive business, not \u2013 we are a pretty asset-light business model, as Scott described earlier. And so at maybe less than 2% of sales, CapEx doesn\u2019t suck up a significant amount of our total cash flow. So, we are very comfortable with continuing to invest in the business as we have done for many years, including throughout the pandemic.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be on the demand outlook in Test & Measurement and Electronics. Very good growth there in Q3. There is obviously a lot of noise at different customers on electronics in particular within that division, but you are still putting up mid-teens organic growth. So, maybe sort of help us understand some of the exposures in that piece. And do you think strong growth is sustainable, again, given what\u2019s going on in terms of a lot of customers in consumer electronics, semi equipment \u2013 semiconductor devices, how you are managing to grow at this rate?\nMichael Larsen: Well, yes. So, we think that the growth is sustainable. We have not seen anything to suggest that it\u2019s slowing down. We are obviously a big beneficiary from all the growth on the semi side of things. But also on the CapEx side with our Instron business, which I think you are familiar with, we are seeing double-digit growth. On the \u2013 everybody\u2019s electronics business, I think is a little bit different. I think when I just look at the businesses in there, including electronic assembly, contamination control, the pressure-sensitive adhesives, we are still showing really solid double-digit growth. North America up 18%, international up 16%. So, there is still some supply chain issues, but I think the team is doing a great job staying on top of those and gaining share. And so we feel very good about the outlook for the Test & Measurement and Electronics business.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Your line is open.\nMig Dobre: Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Michael, just wanted to go back to make sure I have this correct. The implied fourth quarter guidance, you said it was going to be down sequentially relative to Q3. Can you be a little more specific as to what the midpoint implies? And then I am kind of curious, as we are thinking about the year-over-year bridge relative to \u201821, I mean last year in the fourth quarter, we had a 200 basis point hit from price/cost. This year, it seems like we are going to be soundly positive. So, I am sort of curious how we bridge that, and then think about the incremental volume and also whatever is going on in terms of your internal initiatives that are flowing through.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I don\u2019t know, Mig, that I can tell you something I didn\u2019t say already. I think if you take our full year guidance and the fourth quarter kind of implied, as we said, organic growth of about 10%, solid incrementals in our normal range, maybe a little bit higher than that. Operating margins improved more than 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We would expect another 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Price/cost goes from negative to slightly positive from a margin standpoint and also positive accretive to income, as I have said. So, those are kind of the high-level view on the fourth quarter. And again, we are not \u2013 we have adjusted our run rates on the top line, which is a little bit different than in prior years. We are just wanting to be a little conservative, hopefully, and account for some of the softness we are seeing in about 20% of the company, but also incorporate a lot of strength in the businesses that we talked about, including Auto, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, Welding. And so that\u2019s maybe \u2013 those are kind of the key elements of the fourth quarter.\nMig Dobre: No, I appreciate that. I ask because I am also not very good at math. And as I am kind of looking at your guidance here, to me, it looks like you have raised your revenue by, call it, $300 million. You have reduced your operating income margin by 50 bps. Net-net, that\u2019s more or less neutral to operating income, yet EPS came down $0.15 on a core basis. So, I am trying to understand if there is something below the line that\u2019s going on here that we don\u2019t have full appreciation for.\nMichael Larsen: I think I said this earlier, Mig. The reason why we are taking the EPS number down is incremental foreign currency headwind by incorporating current foreign exchange rates like we always do. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s accounting for the EPS adjustment.\nMig Dobre: Alright. Well, I will leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Thank you. You mentioned earlier your capital spending businesses are not yet seeing a slowdown. I assume we are getting close enough to where you have had some conversations with those customers about their \u201823 planning. Are you getting capital budgets for \u201823 that are also very supportive of solid growth, or is that very much a 90-day type comment, even though you would think capital-intensive businesses must give you better visibility than a quarter at a time?\nScott Santi: Yes. Go ahead. I was just going to say, David, we don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a little early in the planning cycle for us in terms of \u201823, number one. Number two, I would say, given our sort of traditional delivery and lead times, which are relatively short, we don\u2019t get a lot of forward visibility even in our CapEx businesses. So, regardless of what anybody has to say in terms of their outlook for the year, that\u2019s going to certainly be a number that\u2019s going to move around. In our sort of core operating MO is that we are going to produce what \u2013 based on what orders we are getting today, we are not going to sort of bite on our forecast on how optimistic or pessimistic, and we have the flexibility in our systems to do that. So, I don\u2019t have a lot of forward, we don\u2019t \u2013 coming back to our businesses and our customers, we don\u2019t have a lot of input in terms of strong points of view one way or the other at this point.\nDavid Raso: I appreciate that. And I have a quick follow-up on the M&A environment, the divestiture, obviously, a nice gain there. Can you just give us an update on how you are looking at further divestitures and M&A versus obviously bumped up the share repo?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So, I think I said there, we have one more potential divestiture that we are working through. And then we have three that are kind of in the pipeline that we are going to spend a little bit more time on next year and determine whether now is the best time to sell those businesses. They are all performing at a high level, significantly better than obviously pre-enterprise strategy. And so it\u2019s just a matter of timing on those divestitures. On the other side of this, we talked about the M&A pipeline on most of these calls. I mean nothing has really changed. I mean I think to the extent we find acquisitions that are a good fit for us strategically, which really means that they can grow at 4% to 5% organically over a sustained period of time, we have significant margin improvement through the implementation of the business model. And we can \u2013 and their valuation is reasonable in the sense that we can generate a rate of return that makes sense for the company, then just like we did with MTS, when those opportunities come along, we are definitely going to lean in. And I think we have called our posture kind of aggressively opportunistic. So, when those come along, we don\u2019t have a lot of those, but when we do see them, we are definitely going to lean in hard just like we did with MTS. And there is nothing in the pipeline here in the near-term is what I can offer.\nDavid Raso: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nScott Santi: Alright. Thanks, David.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: And thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. In Q3, revenue grew 13% to $4 billion, with strong organic growth of 16%. The MTS acquisition contributed 3% to revenue. Foreign currency translation was a 6% headwind compared to a 4% headwind last quarter. And despite $0.13 of year-over-year EPS headwind from foreign currency translation, GAAP EPS was $2.35, an increase of 16%. Excluding MTS, incremental margin in our base business was 39%, which as Scott said, was a welcome return to our normal historical incremental margin rates. As a result of our strong revenue and margin performance, operating income increased 16% to $983 million, which was an all-time quarterly record. Operating margin was 24.5%, with operating leverage of almost 300 basis points and 110 basis points of enterprise initiatives. Excluding 60 basis points of margin impact from the MTS acquisition, operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 25.1%. Free cash flow was solid at $612 million, an increase of 46% versus Q2 and 12% year-over-year. The conversion rate of 84% is lower than our typical Q3 performance as we remain committed in the near term to intentional working capital investments to support double-digit organic growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers. Finally, share repurchases in Q3 were $500 million and our effective tax rate was 24% versus 21% in the prior year. With that, let's turn to Slide 4 and starting with organic growth by geography. We delivered growth in the mid-teens across all major geographies, led by North America up 17%. Europe, which represents about 23% of our sales, grew 14%, led by automotive OEM up 26% and food equipment, up 15%. China grew 15%, led by Test & Measurement and Electronics, up 32% and automotive OEM was up 29%. Price/cost was accretive to income in Q3 and slightly dilutive by 40 basis points to margin. As we have said before, our business teams around the world have done an exceptional job of adjusting price to offset cost increases throughout the most significant inflationary cycle in over 40 years. And should the pace of raw material cost inflation continue to moderate, we expect price/cost to be accretive to income and slightly accretive to margin in Q4. As Scott mentioned, throughout this unprecedented 2-year inflationary cycle, the company has absorbed as much as 250 basis points of margin dilution impact from price/cost, which we expect to fully recover of the succeeding six to eight quarters after input prices stabilize. Moving on to the segments. Automotive OEM delivered strong organic growth of 25%, with North America up 21% and Europe up 26%. China was up 29%, which included some sequential recovery from the lockdown impact in Q2. When looking at these year-over-year growth rates, keep in mind that the comparisons are against the Q3 last year when the chip shortage led to a low point for auto production. We continue to make good progress on our content per vehicle growth as evidenced by our year-to-date organic growth rate of 9% compared to auto builds of 7%, in line with our long-term market outgrowth target of 2 to 3 percentage points. Consistent with our guidance all year, we do not expect a meaningful improvement in the chip shortage situation impacting automotive production until next year. And we continue to take a more conservative approach to our guidance, which assumes that automotive production essentially remains around current levels through the balance of this year. And as we have said before, as supply chain issues eventually get resolved down the road, we remain confident that the automotive OEM segment is well positioned to be a very meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise for an extended period of time. And as that plays out, we also expect that the automotive OEM segment returns to its typical historical operating margin rates in the low to mid-20s. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered strong organic growth of 23% as North America grew 30% with double-digit growth in every major category and end market. Growth in institutional markets was 50% plus with strength across several categories, most notably lodging. Restaurants were up around 40% and retail growth was in the mid-teens. International revenue grew 14% with Europe up 15% and Asia Pacific up 9%. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 29%, with organic growth of 17% as Test & Measurement grew 20% and Electronics was up 14%. Growth was broad-based with continued strength in semiconductor and CapEx spending as evidenced by organic growth of 13% in the Instron business. Moving on to Slide 6, welding grew 14% organically, with equipment up 13% and consumables up 15%. Industrial was the standout with organic growth of 32%. The commercial side of the welding business, which sells to smaller businesses and individual users, was down 10% due to lower demand and inventory destocking in the channel. However, due to the strength on the industrial side, North America still grew 14% and international grew 12%. Sales to oil and gas customers were up 12% in the quarter. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 31.5%, which was a new record for the Welding segment. Polymers & Fluids grew 8% organically, with Polymers up 21% on continued strength in industrial applications. Softening demand due to higher gas prices and the impact on consumer discretionary spend impacted the automotive aftermarket business, which was up 2%. Fluids was up 5% and overall North America grew 5%, international was up 14%. Construction delivered organic growth of 17% with continued strength in North America, which was up 35%. U.S. residential grew 42% and commercial was up 17%. That said, we did see some signs of slowing towards the end of the quarter and we expect that to continue in Q4, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. The international side of construction is slowing, with Europe down 1%. Australia and New Zealand was up 7% against an easy comparison. Specialty growth was essentially flat as product line simplification activities resulted in the elimination of a product line in one of our consumer packaging businesses. Excluding PLS, the segment would have been up 3%. Demand in our appliance components division slowed, which we have reflected in our updated guidance. On a geographic basis, North America was down 2% and international grew 4%. Looking on Slide 8 for an update on the year and starting with the top line, we are raising our full year organic growth guidance to 11% to 12% due to the strength of our Q3 organic growth performance and projecting current levels of demand, which remains strong across most of our businesses. But we are also anticipating further slowing in the end markets we talked about, including global residential construction, automotive aftermarket, commercial welding and appliance components, that combined represent about 20% of total company revenue. The MTS acquisition is expected to add 3% to revenue and at current exchange rates, currency translation will reduce revenue by 5%, resulting in total revenue for the year up 9% to 10%. For Q4, we are well positioned to deliver a strong finish to a very strong year with organic growth of approximately 10% and GAAP EPS growth of about 40%. In Q4 and consistent with our previously announced plan to divest certain business units, we completed the sale of a division within the Polymers & Fluids segment, with an estimated after-tax gain of $0.45 per share. We have included this Q4 gain in our updated full year guidance. And per our usual process, we have narrowed the range for the year with one quarter to go and updated our guidance to reflect current foreign exchange rates, which results in additional foreign currency headwind versus our prior guidance. So as a result of including the gain on sale and updating guidance with current foreign exchange rates, our updated full year GAAP EPS guidance range is $9.45 to $9.55. We are projecting operating margin of approximately 24% for the full year, which includes approximately 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives, about 200 basis points contribution from volume leverage and estimated 100 basis points of negative margin impact from price/cost and about 50 basis points of margin dilution from the acquisition of MTS. We expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 80%, which, as we have talked about, is below our typical 100% plus conversion rate due to the intentional near-term working capital investments that support the company's double-digit revenue growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustained customer service levels. And finally, share repurchases are now expected to be $1.75 billion for the full year, an increase of $250 million versus prior guidance. Looking forward, we are obviously not immune to the macro challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead. But through the execution of our enterprise strategy, we have positioned this company to deliver top-tier results in any environment, as reflected in our differentiated performance at the depth of the pandemic and in the very dynamic and challenging conditions that have characterized the recovery over the last 2 years. We remain confident that the combination of the powerful competitive advantages we derive from ITW's proprietary business model, our high-quality business portfolio and our team's proven ability to consistently execute at a very high level ahead well prepared to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge in 2023 and beyond. With that, Karen, I will turn it back to you. That is correct. So we are going \u2013 we're expecting that if inflation stays where it is, and so based on the known increases and decreases and based on the price that we expect to realize in the fourth quarter, that price/cost will be accretive on an EPS basis and also, for the first time in a while, accretive on a margin basis as well. Yes, that's correct. So this is not our typical run rate. This has been adjusted with some anticipated further slowing in the end markets that we talked about. It is higher than the 10%. Yes. So as you know, Tami, we don't report price and volume separately. But what I think we can tell you is that we are seeing, in Q3, we saw meaningful volume growth across the company, including particularly in \u2013 if you look at the strength in Auto, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, you're not going to put out numbers like that without a meaningful contribution from volume. Yes. I think that's the reason. Obviously, this is a very dynamic environment but there is a lot of strength in the businesses that I just talked about that more than offset some of the slowing we're seeing at about 20% of the company. So I think we're really well positioned for a strong finish here in Q4. And if you look at the implied guidance, we're looking at organic growth, like we said, double digit. We're looking at margin improvement of more than 100 basis points, GAAP EPS growth of 40%, 15% excluding the divestiture gain that we talked about earlier. So a really strong finish to what's been a very strong year for the company. Sure. Well, I think what we've seen is primarily a slowdown on the residential side, which is about 80% of our business. And we talked about softening on the international side here on our call last quarter. And so we did see Europe down 1%. I think that's pretty broad-based, UK, Continental Europe at this point, given some of the challenges, that's probably what you would expect. Australia and New Zealand is also slowing here. And as the comps get a little more difficult, you're going to see those growth rates start to come down. I think in North America, there is still a fair bit of, obviously, strength in the business. And then late in the quarter, we're really starting to see the order rates starting to come down on the residential side, so... I think it's reasonable to assume that our incremental margins will be a little bit higher than our normal range, just given the recovery on price/cost that we talked about. So assuming again, Joe, that from an inflation side that things stay where they are or continue to moderate, then that would be a reasonable expectation. Well, I mean, I think there is certainly a reason to be a little bit more concerned about Europe, just if you look at the macro picture. I think the fact is our businesses are performing at a really high level right now. And so if you just look at Q3, I'll just go back to a little bit of commentary on Europe specifically. We had six segments growing between 9% and 26%, and so double-digit growth in five of the seven segments and only construction was down 1%. And it's not all Auto. If you take out Auto, Europe still grew 10%. I think obviously, we expect those growth rates to moderate here in the fourth quarter. But I think we're really well positioned in Europe to deal with, just like the rest of the company, deal with whatever that's ahead. And if we have a little bit more softness maybe in Europe, maybe we have a little more strength in other parts of the world, and that's kind of how the company is set up, as Scott said. So we will read and react. We will deal with whatever is ahead of us, but we're confident that we will continue to outperform on a relative basis. Yes, Jamie, it's all price/cost in construction so a little bit more headwind here than in some of the other parts of the company. And so I will also say that 25.7% operating margin in construction is not too shabby at this point. So \u2013 but still, you're right. Relative to prior year, we're down due to the price/cost dynamic. Well, I think from the beginning in terms of the \u2013 so one, we're confident that we are gaining market share across the portfolio and the kind of the guidance was only strategic long-term market share gains and not opportunistic kind of one-time orders from new customers. So we've really focused on serving our 80 customers, as we call them, our best customers better than anybody else. And because of our win the recovery positioning, we are doing that and as a result of that gaining market share. I mean, it's hard to \u2013 we have 83 divisions so it's hard to point to specific areas. But if you just look at our overall at the enterprise level, organic growth of 16% in the third quarter, I think relative to other industrial companies that will probably compare pretty well. Yes. So if I understand your question, so we're currently running at about 3 months on hand. We're typically running at 2 months on hand in terms of inventory. And as supply conditions here begin to normalize and we're going to see a return to normal levels in that 2 months on hand. When exactly that happens is difficult to predict, but we are starting to see some signs that supply chain is improving. So I think it's reasonable to assume that once conditions normalize, that it will take us about six to eight quarters to get back to 2 months on hand. And obviously, just like our conversion rate is below our historical typical levels at this point, they are going to be above for that period of time as we benefit from significant working capital release. When exactly that plays out is difficult to say. It's not all going to come back in one quarter. I mean, we've built this up over 2 years. It's going to take some time to get it back out again. But we're confident we've added the right level of inventory, and it's really put us in a great position to serve our customers, mitigate supply chain risk and, like we said, take market share. Correct. Yes. I think if you look at it historically, we typically \u2013 Q3 is our highest quarter and we go down in Q4. The primary driver is that there is just less shipping days in the fourth quarter. So I think this year, there are 61 shipping days in Q4. There were 64 in the third quarter and so that's really the main driver here. On EPS, obviously, implied is slightly lower than what we just did in Q3. And the delta there is the foreign exchange piece. Well, usually, residential is kind of the leading indicator. So, we just haven't seen it yet. Yes. No, we haven't really. If you have any great idea, send them over. But we are a short-cycle company. We read and react what's in front of us, and trying to predict what the government is going to do, I think has not really been a winning equation for us anyway. It may work well for others but not in our case. I think the fourth quarter looks a lot like the third quarter, except the organic growth rates are coming down. And so from a margin standpoint, it's pretty close to the third quarter. Yes, we are. I mean we saw a meaningful decline here in Q3 from Q2, and we expect to see the same thing in Q4. I think there is maybe one more potentially here in the near-term. And then we will have to assess the remainder and whether now is a good time to move forward with those. But I think our views haven't changed in terms of the portfolio and the raw material that we need in order to continue to deliver the type of results that we are delivering. And so we have about a handful of businesses that we had flagged for potential divestiture. We just completed one. Maybe one more to go and then the balance, we will kind of reassess in the New Year. Yes, obviously. So, it's not a matter of whether or not we are going to benefit from working capital coming back down to normal levels. That we are sure of, we just don't know when. And in the near-term, we are absolutely committed to what Scott talked about, which is intentional working capital, including inventory to support double-digit growth and significant market share gains. So, we will update you if and when that changes. And then we will let you know what we think exactly the \u2013 how it might play out from a free cash flow standpoint. Well, CapEx, I mean I think we have always funded every good project inside of the company, including during the pandemic, and I think that's going to continue. We are really fortunate that we are not a capital-intensive business, not \u2013 we are a pretty asset-light business model, as Scott described earlier. And so at maybe less than 2% of sales, CapEx doesn't suck up a significant amount of our total cash flow. So, we are very comfortable with continuing to invest in the business as we have done for many years, including throughout the pandemic. Well, yes. So, we think that the growth is sustainable. We have not seen anything to suggest that it's slowing down. We are obviously a big beneficiary from all the growth on the semi side of things. But also on the CapEx side with our Instron business, which I think you are familiar with, we are seeing double-digit growth. On the \u2013 everybody's electronics business, I think is a little bit different. I think when I just look at the businesses in there, including electronic assembly, contamination control, the pressure-sensitive adhesives, we are still showing really solid double-digit growth. North America up 18%, international up 16%. So, there is still some supply chain issues, but I think the team is doing a great job staying on top of those and gaining share. And so we feel very good about the outlook for the Test & Measurement and Electronics business. Yes. I don't know, Mig, that I can tell you something I didn't say already. I think if you take our full year guidance and the fourth quarter kind of implied, as we said, organic growth of about 10%, solid incrementals in our normal range, maybe a little bit higher than that. Operating margins improved more than 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. We would expect another 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Price/cost goes from negative to slightly positive from a margin standpoint and also positive accretive to income, as I have said. So, those are kind of the high-level view on the fourth quarter. And again, we are not \u2013 we have adjusted our run rates on the top line, which is a little bit different than in prior years. We are just wanting to be a little conservative, hopefully, and account for some of the softness we are seeing in about 20% of the company, but also incorporate a lot of strength in the businesses that we talked about, including Auto, Food Equipment, Test & Measurement, Welding. And so that's maybe \u2013 those are kind of the key elements of the fourth quarter. I think I said this earlier, Mig. The reason why we are taking the EPS number down is incremental foreign currency headwind by incorporating current foreign exchange rates like we always do. So, that's what's accounting for the EPS adjustment. Yes. So, I think I said there, we have one more potential divestiture that we are working through. And then we have three that are kind of in the pipeline that we are going to spend a little bit more time on next year and determine whether now is the best time to sell those businesses. They are all performing at a high level, significantly better than obviously pre-enterprise strategy. And so it's just a matter of timing on those divestitures. On the other side of this, we talked about the M&A pipeline on most of these calls. I mean nothing has really changed. I mean I think to the extent we find acquisitions that are a good fit for us strategically, which really means that they can grow at 4% to 5% organically over a sustained period of time, we have significant margin improvement through the implementation of the business model. And we can \u2013 and their valuation is reasonable in the sense that we can generate a rate of return that makes sense for the company, then just like we did with MTS, when those opportunities come along, we are definitely going to lean in. And I think we have called our posture kind of aggressively opportunistic. So, when those come along, we don't have a lot of those, but when we do see them, we are definitely going to lean in hard just like we did with MTS. And there is nothing in the pipeline here in the near-term is what I can offer."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thanks, Karen and good morning, everyone. In what remains a very dynamic and challenging operating environment, we were pleased with our Q3 performance. On the top line, we delivered 13% revenue growth with 16% organic growth from our base businesses. While we did see some softening in channel inventory reduction actions in our businesses serving the construction, auto aftermarket, commercial welding and appliance markets, five of our seven segments delivered double-digit organic growth, led by automotive OEM, up 25% and food equipment, up 23%. With regard to margins, we were glad to see our incremental margins in Q3 return to our normal 30% plus level for the first time in five quarters as the impact of volume growth, enterprise initiatives, pricing actions and some moderation in the pace of input cost inflation drove incremental margin of 39% and a 130 basis point improvement in operating margin in our base businesses. We have lost roughly 250 basis points of margin due to price/cost during this period of rapid inflation, which we fully expect to recover over time once the current inflationary environment stabilizes and it was certainly good to see a nice solid first step in that direction in Q3. On the bottom line, strong growth and margin performance resulted in GAAP EPS of $2.35, up 16% versus Q3 of last year and that 16% growth includes $0.13 of negative impact from currency. Excluding currency, earnings per share were up 23%. Looking at our current performance, our decision to stay invested in our long-term strategy and in our people during the pandemic and the quality of our team's execution of our recovery strategy coming out of it are fueling the strong organic growth and financial performance that we are currently delivering. While the economic outlook is becoming increasingly uncertain, demand remains solid across the majority of our business portfolio. And as a result, the company is well positioned to deliver a strong finish to what has been a very strong year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Michael who will provide more detail on the quarter and our updated guidance. Michael? Good morning. Well, we've talked about this before, but one of the fundamental elements of 80/20 is that we are \u2013 that we have a very flexible cost structure. So we are \u2013 we do a lot of outsourcing upstream. We want to assemble. We want to control the manufacturing elements that really matter from the standpoint of control of quality-controlled delivery. But we don't necessarily have to bend all the metal. We don't have to necessarily do all the upstream work. And so what that gets us fundamentally, in fact, we prefer not to, and what ultimately that gives us is a relatively flexible cost structure. So we are a read and react company. Our businesses are going to respond to whatever the demand is that sits right in front of them. We've talked about that before. We don't do a lot of forward forecasting. We are producing today what our customers bought yesterday. And as demand rates start to decline in places like construction, then those adjustments will take place real time. Thank you. Good. Good morning. Hi, Andy. Yes, I think the only thing I would add is that it is among the most interest rate-sensitive end markets that we serve. And so you're seeing in the housing start data and a lot of other things that the rapid pace of interest rates rising is certainly starting to bite in the housing market. It's \u2013 I'll just point to the fact that it remains a very strong, very profitable business for us, and it points to just the value of the diversified portfolio is we're going to see some pressure in some places, but we've got plenty of other places that are more than picking up and that's really by design. That's how we're trying to position the company ultimately to outperform in any environment. Not yet. Good morning. Good morning. I think just \u2013 I think the question was more in terms of our cost of goods, what percentage of those are material costs. Okay. I think... Well, there is a lot of factors that go into the last part of your question. I think the simple answer on your first 1 is that the percentage of material as the \u2013 material cost percentage as an overall versus the overall COGS is going to vary. But let's just say, roughly 60%, 65%, 35% freight labor, other elements of the cost structure if that helps. On the commercial? Yes. I will maybe start on the first part with regard to inventory, and that is that we haven't seen enough stability yet on the supply chain side to make us comfortable that we can start backing off. So, our first priority is to preserve our ability to serve our customers. And so at this point, we are still in the mode of keeping the inventories where they are. As we start to see things become more, let's call it, reliable and consistent there, then we will certainly start making a move. But as of right now, we have \u2013 we are not in the mood of \u2013 in the mode of starting to reduce inventories. And there is a question on CapEx. Yes. Go ahead. I was just going to say, David, we don't \u2013 it's a little early in the planning cycle for us in terms of \u201823, number one. Number two, I would say, given our sort of traditional delivery and lead times, which are relatively short, we don't get a lot of forward visibility even in our CapEx businesses. So, regardless of what anybody has to say in terms of their outlook for the year, that's going to certainly be a number that's going to move around. In our sort of core operating MO is that we are going to produce what \u2013 based on what orders we are getting today, we are not going to sort of bite on our forecast on how optimistic or pessimistic, and we have the flexibility in our systems to do that. So, I don't have a lot of forward, we don't \u2013 coming back to our businesses and our customers, we don't have a lot of input in terms of strong points of view one way or the other at this point. Alright. Thanks, David."

I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's second quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2021 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.

Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi : Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The ITW team delivered another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance with organic growth of 10.4%, operating margin of 23.1%, after-tax return on invested capital of 27.8% and GAAP EPS of $2.37. In the second quarter, we saw continued strong demand across our portfolio, supported by our 80/20 front-to-back driven operational capabilities. Our teams continue to do an exceptional job of delivering for our customers and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth. As a result of our advantaged operational execution and delivery performance, we are being rewarded with meaningful additional share by our customers as evidenced by our 10.5% organic growth in the first half of this year. While input cost inflation and supply chain issues remain challenging, we did see some stabilization on both fronts in Q2. In fact, for the first time in 2 years, price/cost margin dilution headwind improved sequentially from negative 250 basis points in Q1 to negative 160 basis points in Q2 as our businesses continue to do an excellent job of adjusting price to offset input cost inflation, and the pace and magnitude of input cost increases moderated somewhat. Importantly, our teams delivered these strong operational and financial results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy. And they delivered another 90 basis points of margin improvement from enterprise initiatives in the quarter. Based on our first half results and projecting current demand and supply rates through the balance of the year, we are maintaining our guidance for full year 2022, with organic growth of 8.5% at the midpoint, margins in the range of 24% to 25% and GAAP EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint, which would be an all-time record for the company. Excluding onetime tax items in both years, this represents EPS growth of 12%. While the near-term environment remains challenging and the global macro is certainly uncertain, ITW remains strongly positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for our shareholders, differentiated service to our customers and continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential performance through the back half of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, quarterly revenue grew 9% and exceeded $4 billion for the first time since 2012, with strong organic growth of 10.4%. The MTS acquisition contributed 3% to revenue. Foreign currency translation was a 4% headwind. Despite $0.10 of year-over-year EPS headwind from foreign currency translation and $0.05 of higher restructuring expense, GAAP EPS was $2.37, the second highest quarterly EPS ever. By geography, North America grew 14% and international grew 6%, with 6% growth in Europe and 3% growth in Asia Pacific. China organic revenue was down 4%, and we estimate that the China lockdowns reduced our organic growth rate by about 1 percentage point at the enterprise level, which we fully expect to recover in the second half. Operating margin was 23.1% with operating leverage of 200 basis points and 90 basis points of enterprise initiatives. Margin headwinds included 50 basis points each from the MTS acquisition and higher restructuring expense related to 80/20 front-to-back projects. And the margin dilution impact from price cost was 160 basis points. Free cash flow was $420 million, an increase of 69% versus Q1. So we remain committed to intentional working capital investments to support growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels for our key customers. The routine resolution of a U.S. tax audit resulted in a onetime tax benefit of $0.16. And as you may recall, in Q2 last year had a $0.35 onetime tax benefit. As a result, our Q2 tax rate this year was 18.3% as compared to 10.1% last year. Excluding these onetime tax benefits, the effective tax rate was 23.9% this year and 23% last year. Please turn to Slide 4 with a look at price/cost and the beginning of the improvement trend on margin dilution that Scott mentioned. Thanks to our business's decisive price actions throughout this inflationary cycle, we have stayed ahead of inflation on a dollar-per-dollar basis. And the seemingly endless barrage of cost increases over the last 12 months appear to have leveled off such that we are beginning to recover the margin dilution impact. Based on all known costs and price increases, this positive trend is projected to continue such that the margin impact is expected to be neutral in the second half. Throughout this 2-year inflationary cycle, while we have more than covered cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis, we have absorbed as much as 250 basis points of margin dilution impact. As raw material cost inflation begins to moderate on a year-over-year basis, we are confident that we're going to recover this margin impact, hopefully, starting in 2023. Moving on to the segments. Automotive OEM delivered solid organic growth of 6% with 18% growth in North America. Europe was down about 1% and China was down 11%. At this point, and consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect a meaningful improvement in the chip shortage situation impacting auto production until 2023. In effect, our guidance assumes that automotive production remains around current levels for the second half. While we are getting positive signals from several of our customers in terms of preparing for a Q3 and Q4 ramp-up in auto production, we are taking a more conservative approach to our guidance per our usual process. And even with revenue around current levels, keep in mind that the year-over-year comps ease in the second half, which sets the Automotive OEM segment up as a meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise through the balance of the year. Operating margin was 17% when excluding 270 basis points of 80/20 front-to-back restructuring impact this quarter. As supply chain issues get resolved down the road and auto production ramps up, we're confident that we'll see some strong organic growth rates for an extended period of time and a return to the segment's historic margin rates in the low to mid-20s. Let's turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, which led the way this quarter with an organic growth rate of 25%, record quarterly revenues of $614 million and operating margin of 24.7%. North America grew 27% with double-digit growth in every major category and end market. Both restaurants and institutions were up around 40% and retail growth was in the mid-teens. International revenue grew 23%, with Europe up 25% and Asia Pacific up 11%. Orders remain very strong in this segment. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 15%, with organic growth of 1%, which, as you know, is uncharacteristically low for this segment and entirely due to the timing of a large equipment order from an Electronics customer in Q2 last year. Adjusted for that order, segment organic growth would have been about 7%, which is a more accurate representation of how strong the order intake is. Test & Measurement organic growth was 8%, with continued strong demand for CapEx as evidenced by Instron growth of 5%, as well as continued strength in semiconductor-related end markets. Moving to Slide 6. On another positive note, Welding's organic growth was also strong at plus 22%, with equipment up 24% and consumables up 19%. Industrial grew 29% and the Commercial business was up 19%. North America, which is about 80% of our sales, grew 25%. Oil and gas was up 8%. Sequentially from Q1, revenue was up 8% with continued strong order intake. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 29.3%. Polymers & Fluids grew 10% organically, with Polymers up 25% on continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket was up 4% and Fluids grew 3%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 8% and International was up 13%. While sequential revenue grew from Q1, we did see some slowing demand in our automotive aftermarket business as consumers are dealing with rising inflation and gas prices. On to Slide 7. And Construction delivered strong organic growth of 15%, with continued strength in North America, which was up 29%. U.S. residential grew 34% and commercial was up 20%. While Europe and Australia and New Zealand were up 5% and 4%, respectively, the international businesses started to show some signs of slowing in their order rates towards the end of the quarter. Specialty was the only segment that didn't grow, with organic revenue down 2% as supply chain constraints caused a delay in the delivery of some larger international equipment orders that are now on track for the second half. On a geographic basis, North America was up 5%, while International was down 13%. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2022 guidance, which remains unchanged. Per our usual process, our guidance is based on our actual results year-to-date and a projection of current levels of demand through the balance of the year. As a result, our organic growth projection of 7% to 10% remains unchanged. The acquisition of MTS is projected to add 3% to revenue, and based on current foreign exchange rates, the headwind from foreign currency translation is now 4% versus a prior expectation of 1.5%. We are maintaining our full year GAAP EPS guidance range of $9 to $9.40. And compared to our prior guidance on May 3, the onetime favorable tax benefit of $0.16 in Q2 is offset by $0.20 of additional EPS headwind from foreign exchange, which is now embedded in the outlook. Our operating margin guidance is unchanged at 24% to 25%, with about 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. Price/cost margin dilution impact is unchanged at 100 basis points, which implies that the second half margin dilution impact is about neutral as compared to 200 basis points of headwind in the first half. Finally, there's no change to free cash flow generation or share repurchases of $1.5 billion, and our tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We've often talked about the fact that ITW is a company that can deliver top-tier results in any environment, and this year is no exception. We're obviously not immune to the macro challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead, but we remain confident that ITW is very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher : Okay. Thanks, Michael. David, let's open up the lines for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.\nAndrew Kaplowitz : Scott or Mike, could you give us a little more color on underlying demand trends you're seeing in your more consumer versus capital goods businesses? I know you mentioned just tough comparison Electronics, some slowing in auto aftermarket. But obviously, we all have increased focus on macro slowdown. Are you seeing signs of moderating demand as consumer demand still holding up?\nMichael Larsen: Go ahead, Scott.\nScott Santi: I was going to say, I think Michael told you exactly where we're seeing it, which is a couple of pockets. One is the auto aftermarket business for reasons that are pretty logical related to the gas prices and consumers' discretionary spending in that arena and then the other is our international construction businesses that we did see a little bit of a pullback. Those 2 -- those businesses combined represent, I think, less than 15% of the company's overall revenues. And for the other 85%, we see things remain very strong.\nAndrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Scott. And then Michael, I think you had talked about 200 basis points of price/cost impacting in Q2, and I think it read out of $160 million. So maybe you can give us a little more color on how you're thinking. I know you said neutral for the second half of the year, but obviously, commodity prices have come down pretty significantly lately. So how long does it take for that to read through? And is there maybe some upside to that second half neutral forecast?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think I explained, Andy, can how we do this. I mean, based on all the known price and cost increases as we sit here today, we expect --\nScott Santi: And decrease --\nMichael Larsen: And decreases in certain cases. That's all of those things are cost decreases. All of those things are baked into our assumption today. And when you project that in a pretty mechanical calculation, so there's no assumption here that things get better or worse, it's based on what we know today, that margin dilution impact is essentially neutral here in the second half of the year. And that's how you get that 200-basis point swing in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tami Zakaria with JP Morgan.\nTami Zakaria: Just a quick follow-up on what you said earlier. I think you mentioned some weakness in international construction end markets. Is that focused on both resi and non-resi for you?\nScott Santi: Yes. The biggest positions we have in both of those markets is by far residential. So I think they mostly speak to what's going on in those markets in the residential side in both Europe and Australia.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, we are also seeing a lot of strength in other parts of the company. So while less than 15% may be experiencing a little bit of a slowdown some of the other segments, Food Equipment, Welding, Test & Measurement, Electronics are off to a really strong start here in Q3. If you just look at our July numbers overall for the company, on a year-over-year basis, we're up 18%. So that is the highest monthly organic growth rate that we've seen all year. Sequentially, from June, we are up in July, where typically we are down and actually, 5 of 7 segments are growing double digits. So there's a lot of strength in other parts of the company that at least for the month of July are offsetting some of the slowing we've seen in the parts of the company that we've talked about.\nTami Zakaria: That is super helpful color. And along the same line, has your expectation for overall organic growth in Europe changed since the beginning of the year? The reason I ask it seems like some people are thinking Europe would be in a recession in the back half. Does that alter your expectation for the region in the near term?\nA \u2013Michael Larsen: I think we are pretty close to where we were on our last call, which I think we said we expect kind of low single-digit type growth rates in Europe based again on current run rates. As you know, we\u2019re not assuming any change in the macro other than kind of what we\u2019re seeing today. We are in Europe, I should say, we are hearing some positive \u2013 we are getting some positive signals, like I said in the script, from our automotive customers in terms of potential ramp-up in production here in September and in Q4. And likewise, that\u2019s not baked into our guidance as we sit here today. So I hope you get the sense there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes across the company. And overall, we\u2019re on track to a really strong second half for the company.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Before my question, can we just clarify, Michael, interesting color on July, thanks for that. When you say in July the 85% that's not under pressure is up 18% or the total company is up 18%.\nMichael Larsen: The total company. Yes, on an EBITDA basis, the auto company is up 18% here in July.\nJeff Sprague: That's interesting and surprising. Good to hear. I'm just curious on Welding. I would have guessed perhaps that seeing that stronger number in Welding that maybe oil and gas would have been stronger than up 8%. So it sounds like it must have been pretty broad-based strength across most of the markets that you can kind of see into. So maybe you could give a little bit of color there what's going on in Welding, both from a vertical market standpoint? And any color on what's going on maybe in the channels?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, as you know, 80% of our business is North America, and that's where the strength was, up 25%. And really, you heard equipment up 24%, consumables up 19%, strength in industrial and commercial. And then the international side was up 8%. And that's where our primary oil and gas exposure resides. Europe was up 20%. And then the China business was down, which was the lockdowns again. So down about 6%. And we, like I said earlier, are fully expecting to recover that here in the back half of the year. But a lot of strength in the North America business for sure. And I would be remiss if I didn't point out the margin performance of north of 29% operating margin. So a really strong quarter for the welding business, and Q3 is looking really good so far.\nScott Santi: And just maybe a little additional color. The real strike there in Q2 is the Industrial side. I think, Jeff, part of your question was related to the channel, and that's not a product -- a category of products that typically is inventory in a significant degree of the channel. These are larger, more complex products, machines and systems and they are typically sold into end users for specific projects. So there's not a lot of channel inventory at any point on those products.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis : Just to be clear, guys, I know you don't disclose price explicitly, but is price still going up and net realized price still going up?\nMichael Larsen: We are still -- there is a lag here, as you know, from the time we see the cost increases to the price is being realized. That is somewhere between 1 to 2 quarters, and we are still in catch-up mode here in the second half of the year. Obviously, on a margin basis, we talked about that and also on a dollar basis.\nScott Davis : Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify. And then what -- I know, obviously, the FX has a translation impact, but it can have a trade impact. Can you remind us what businesses you are doing much export --\nScott Santi: We do almost -- yes. Sorry to cut you off, Scott. I'll let you finish your question. I was just going to say, we are producing locally to sell locally. We do very little cross-border commerce, either on the input side or the export side. There's a little bit here and there, but less than 5% of our revenue. It's something like. Yes, it's something like 2% of our imports are from China. I mean, it's really de minimis. We are produced where we sell a company. Our suppliers are local, our customers are local so our exposure is largely translation. So we are sourcing in the same currency that we are producing and selling in the vast majority of cases.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoe O'Dea : I wanted to start on the consumer and sort of the less than 15% that you were talking about. And I think you've talked previously where maybe over half of revenue kind of broadly tied to consumer. But can you help kind of segment that a little bit in terms of where you might have consumer exposure that would be a little bit more tied to something like overall consumer confidence and where you would have exposures that or a little bit more maybe durable in terms of demand trends and not as tied to what we would think about as sort of pressures related to a broad consumer slowdown?\nScott Santi: I think, Joe, we really highlighted the 2 big ones, which is construction, residential and then the automotive aftermarket business. The other one maybe that I would add is in our specialty business, we do a fair amount of consumer packaging. So beverages and resealable closures for things like cheese and other food products that I think have generally proven to be pretty resilient during times of economic contraction, consumer staples basically.\nJoe O'Dea : And then on supply chain, I mean the PMI yesterday for July, I mean, still showing very extended lead times. I think you talked to stabilization, but I'm assuming that means exactly that, not that things are getting better. Can you talk about sort of any visibility that you have into timing of supply chain starting to improve a little bit from a point of stabilization?\nScott Santi: What I would say overall is we have no visibility to any improvement. We are not planning on it. I'm sure that it will get better at some point. I think we have been -- our business has been very resilient in terms of working their way through various issues and challenges, computer chips, you name it. And we are finding a way to serve our customers, and that's that remains, I think, the posture that we have. And until it changes, we're not changing what we're doing and I think we're on it, but it's still not easy.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.\nStephen Volkmann: I was wondering maybe if we could just go back to the price/cost margin dilution chart. I'm assuming there's some sort of a linear relationship here and that 3Q is probably still a small headwind and the exit rate at 4Q is probably a tailwind. Is that a reasonable expectation?\nMichael Larsen: I think as we sit here today, I think that's a reasonable expectation, yes.\nStephen Volkmann: And so Michael, I'm trying to think a little bit further into '23 and just rather than think about volumes, they'll be whatever they are, but you're going to have a few things kind of moving here in terms of sort of price/cost and dilution from MTS and some of the restructuring that you've done. Any way to start to think about what incremental margins in '23 might look like sort of when all is said and done?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think you're right, Steve. There is a lot going on. What I can tell you is that as we kind of peel back the onion on our incrementals, so adjusting for all the things you just talked about, MTS, restructuring and price/cost, we are right back at our core incremental margins in that 35% range right now, and we wouldn't expect anything different in 2023. Obviously, we haven't done the planning yet, but that's kind of long term what you should expect from us is incrementals in that 35% range.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Mig Dobre with Baird.\nMig Dobre: I've been doing this for a while, but my name is always butchered on these earnings calls. Maybe to kind of follow up on Steve's question here thinking about '23. I'm curious, as you're looking at the amount of pricing that you had to put through this year. Is there a good way to think about the carryover that's going to go into '23 relative to '22 from a top line perspective, contribution to the top line?\nMichael Larsen: I think it's a little too early, Mig. I mean, clearly, there will be some carryover. But to try and quantify that right now for you, I don't think would be helpful.\nScott Santi: We've got to get it to our planning process, which is really we're talking about November-ish before we'll have a reasonable view on that, and I think that's the appropriate time.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, I think the only thing I would point back to is what I said in these prepared remarks is that if you add up the price/cost margin dilution impact during this cycle over this year and last year of about 250 basis points, the expectation is that as things begin to normalize, we will recover that margin impact over time. Now how exactly that will play out and the timing around that is not entire clear as we sit here today. But there will be -- I think it's reasonable to assume that some of that impact will be in 2023.\nMig Dobre: Okay. I guess, if I may follow up on this. I'm trying to probe a little bit about your degree of confidence that the business overall will be able to outgrow industrial production as we're thinking '23 and beyond. This has been a big topic, right, over the past few years. You talked about winning the recovery and investing through the downturn. So I'm curious if you can maybe update us a little bit on your degree of confidence that we can continue to see out growth.\nScott Santi: Well, I don't know exactly what I can do to reassure you other than to tell you that it continues to be the #1 dominant priority of every member of ITW from China to Europe to North America to South America, and it is, certainly, we think we've got a terrific opportunity going forward. We have done a lot of things in terms of investing and positioning ourselves to execute on it and the proof will be in the pudding. But it's already happening.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I agree with that, Mig. I mean, I think if you look at the results we put up so far, and granted there's some recovery in here, but last year, organic was up 12%. The first half is up 10% organic this year. I think relative to peers, we're certainly closing the gap compared to where we were kind of just a few years ago. So I think yes, the proof will be in the organic growth rate numbers that we're going to put up. But I also will tell you there is a high degree of confidence that we are making significant progress. Lots more to do, but certainly, we are headed in the right direction here for sure.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Sorry about that. Just wanted to clarify on the margin outlook because I suppose the margin rate or the margin guide for the year implies the fourth quarter margins are maybe up 300, 400 basis points year-on-year or something. Just wanted to confirm that, that's roughly the right way to think about the back half guide. And maybe what are the main drivers of that big fourth quarter margin uplift?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, the big driver for the second half here is what we just talked about, which is 200 basis points of price/cost margin dilution impact in the first half, that's not projected to repeat in the second half. So that's probably the biggest driver. I think you also have to factor in -- if you just run rate -- if you just take our current revenues and project those into Q3 and Q4 because the comps are easing on a year-over-year basis, we'll be putting up some meaningful organic growth rates with all the operating leverage and the incrementals that are returning to something a lot closer to our historical incrementals in the back half of the year. And so those are kind of the big drivers here, less price/cost margin headwind and significant organic growth year-over-year with more normal incremental margins in that 35%, maybe plus range for the back half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: I understand. And then just a follow-up on free cash flow. I think your sort of 90% odd conversion guide for the year on free cash, that implies, I think, sort of 50% growth in the free cash year-on-year in the second half. So just help us understand how do you get that monstrous sort of free cash flow expansion. Is that just a mass of sort of inventory destock because supply chains are easing? Maybe just any color around that because it is a big move for a sort of a company.\nMichael Larsen: It's a little bigger than usual. I mean, as you know, historically, our second half cash flows are always significantly higher than the first half. It's a little bit more this time. We've talked about the fact that we've been very intentional in terms of our working capital investments to support the growth that we're seeing double-digit growth at the top line, mitigate supply chain risk, which is still a reality and then sustain the service levels for our customers. So we will carry whatever inventory we need to do those things. If you look at our months on hand, we're running right around 3 months on hand. And we really only need a slight improvement in that in the months on hand to get to those free cash flow numbers. So as we sit here today, we do have a line of sight to a ramp-up in the second half. But like I said, we think it's a smart use of this balance sheet to support everything we're trying to do from an organic growth standpoint by taking care of our customers. And I will say this, if we come in at the low end of the range, it won't change anything in terms of our capital allocation plans for the year. We'll still do the buyback. We'll still do, obviously, investments. We'll still do the dividend. And so there's really no trade-off here. But obviously, we'd like to hit the free cash flow number, and we have line of sight to doing that for the back half of the year. And we are obviously aware that it's a little bit more of a ramp than what we normally have.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, quarterly revenue grew 9% and exceeded $4 billion for the first time since 2012, with strong organic growth of 10.4%. The MTS acquisition contributed 3% to revenue. Foreign currency translation was a 4% headwind. Despite $0.10 of year-over-year EPS headwind from foreign currency translation and $0.05 of higher restructuring expense, GAAP EPS was $2.37, the second highest quarterly EPS ever. By geography, North America grew 14% and international grew 6%, with 6% growth in Europe and 3% growth in Asia Pacific. China organic revenue was down 4%, and we estimate that the China lockdowns reduced our organic growth rate by about 1 percentage point at the enterprise level, which we fully expect to recover in the second half. Operating margin was 23.1% with operating leverage of 200 basis points and 90 basis points of enterprise initiatives. Margin headwinds included 50 basis points each from the MTS acquisition and higher restructuring expense related to 80/20 front-to-back projects. And the margin dilution impact from price cost was 160 basis points. Free cash flow was $420 million, an increase of 69% versus Q1. So we remain committed to intentional working capital investments to support growth, mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels for our key customers. The routine resolution of a U.S. tax audit resulted in a onetime tax benefit of $0.16. And as you may recall, in Q2 last year had a $0.35 onetime tax benefit. As a result, our Q2 tax rate this year was 18.3% as compared to 10.1% last year. Excluding these onetime tax benefits, the effective tax rate was 23.9% this year and 23% last year. Please turn to Slide 4 with a look at price/cost and the beginning of the improvement trend on margin dilution that Scott mentioned. Thanks to our business's decisive price actions throughout this inflationary cycle, we have stayed ahead of inflation on a dollar-per-dollar basis. And the seemingly endless barrage of cost increases over the last 12 months appear to have leveled off such that we are beginning to recover the margin dilution impact. Based on all known costs and price increases, this positive trend is projected to continue such that the margin impact is expected to be neutral in the second half. Throughout this 2-year inflationary cycle, while we have more than covered cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis, we have absorbed as much as 250 basis points of margin dilution impact. As raw material cost inflation begins to moderate on a year-over-year basis, we are confident that we're going to recover this margin impact, hopefully, starting in 2023. Moving on to the segments. Automotive OEM delivered solid organic growth of 6% with 18% growth in North America. Europe was down about 1% and China was down 11%. At this point, and consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect a meaningful improvement in the chip shortage situation impacting auto production until 2023. In effect, our guidance assumes that automotive production remains around current levels for the second half. While we are getting positive signals from several of our customers in terms of preparing for a Q3 and Q4 ramp-up in auto production, we are taking a more conservative approach to our guidance per our usual process. And even with revenue around current levels, keep in mind that the year-over-year comps ease in the second half, which sets the Automotive OEM segment up as a meaningful contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise through the balance of the year. Operating margin was 17% when excluding 270 basis points of 80/20 front-to-back restructuring impact this quarter. As supply chain issues get resolved down the road and auto production ramps up, we're confident that we'll see some strong organic growth rates for an extended period of time and a return to the segment's historic margin rates in the low to mid-20s. Let's turn to Slide 5 for Food Equipment, which led the way this quarter with an organic growth rate of 25%, record quarterly revenues of $614 million and operating margin of 24.7%. North America grew 27% with double-digit growth in every major category and end market. Both restaurants and institutions were up around 40% and retail growth was in the mid-teens. International revenue grew 23%, with Europe up 25% and Asia Pacific up 11%. Orders remain very strong in this segment. Test & Measurement and Electronics revenue grew 15%, with organic growth of 1%, which, as you know, is uncharacteristically low for this segment and entirely due to the timing of a large equipment order from an Electronics customer in Q2 last year. Adjusted for that order, segment organic growth would have been about 7%, which is a more accurate representation of how strong the order intake is. Test & Measurement organic growth was 8%, with continued strong demand for CapEx as evidenced by Instron growth of 5%, as well as continued strength in semiconductor-related end markets. Moving to Slide 6. On another positive note, Welding's organic growth was also strong at plus 22%, with equipment up 24% and consumables up 19%. Industrial grew 29% and the Commercial business was up 19%. North America, which is about 80% of our sales, grew 25%. Oil and gas was up 8%. Sequentially from Q1, revenue was up 8% with continued strong order intake. Operating margin improved 80 basis points to 29.3%. Polymers & Fluids grew 10% organically, with Polymers up 25% on continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Automotive aftermarket was up 4% and Fluids grew 3%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 8% and International was up 13%. While sequential revenue grew from Q1, we did see some slowing demand in our automotive aftermarket business as consumers are dealing with rising inflation and gas prices. On to Slide 7. And Construction delivered strong organic growth of 15%, with continued strength in North America, which was up 29%. U.S. residential grew 34% and commercial was up 20%. While Europe and Australia and New Zealand were up 5% and 4%, respectively, the international businesses started to show some signs of slowing in their order rates towards the end of the quarter. Specialty was the only segment that didn't grow, with organic revenue down 2% as supply chain constraints caused a delay in the delivery of some larger international equipment orders that are now on track for the second half. On a geographic basis, North America was up 5%, while International was down 13%. Okay. Let's turn to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2022 guidance, which remains unchanged. Per our usual process, our guidance is based on our actual results year-to-date and a projection of current levels of demand through the balance of the year. As a result, our organic growth projection of 7% to 10% remains unchanged. The acquisition of MTS is projected to add 3% to revenue, and based on current foreign exchange rates, the headwind from foreign currency translation is now 4% versus a prior expectation of 1.5%. We are maintaining our full year GAAP EPS guidance range of $9 to $9.40. And compared to our prior guidance on May 3, the onetime favorable tax benefit of $0.16 in Q2 is offset by $0.20 of additional EPS headwind from foreign exchange, which is now embedded in the outlook. Our operating margin guidance is unchanged at 24% to 25%, with about 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives. Price/cost margin dilution impact is unchanged at 100 basis points, which implies that the second half margin dilution impact is about neutral as compared to 200 basis points of headwind in the first half. Finally, there's no change to free cash flow generation or share repurchases of $1.5 billion, and our tax rate for the full year is expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. We've often talked about the fact that ITW is a company that can deliver top-tier results in any environment, and this year is no exception. We're obviously not immune to the macro challenges and uncertainties that may lie ahead, but we remain confident that ITW is very well positioned to continue to deliver differentiated best-in-class performance as we leverage our diversified high-quality business portfolio, the competitive strength of ITW's proprietary business model and our team's proven ability to execute at a very high level in any environment. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Go ahead, Scott. Well, I think I explained, Andy, can how we do this. I mean, based on all the known price and cost increases as we sit here today, we expect -- And decreases in certain cases. That's all of those things are cost decreases. All of those things are baked into our assumption today. And when you project that in a pretty mechanical calculation, so there's no assumption here that things get better or worse, it's based on what we know today, that margin dilution impact is essentially neutral here in the second half of the year. And that's how you get that 200-basis point swing in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year. Yes. And I would just add to that. I mean, we are also seeing a lot of strength in other parts of the company. So while less than 15% may be experiencing a little bit of a slowdown some of the other segments, Food Equipment, Welding, Test & Measurement, Electronics are off to a really strong start here in Q3. If you just look at our July numbers overall for the company, on a year-over-year basis, we're up 18%. So that is the highest monthly organic growth rate that we've seen all year. Sequentially, from June, we are up in July, where typically we are down and actually, 5 of 7 segments are growing double digits. So there's a lot of strength in other parts of the company that at least for the month of July are offsetting some of the slowing we've seen in the parts of the company that we've talked about. The total company. Yes, on an EBITDA basis, the auto company is up 18% here in July. Yes. I mean, as you know, 80% of our business is North America, and that's where the strength was, up 25%. And really, you heard equipment up 24%, consumables up 19%, strength in industrial and commercial. And then the international side was up 8%. And that's where our primary oil and gas exposure resides. Europe was up 20%. And then the China business was down, which was the lockdowns again. So down about 6%. And we, like I said earlier, are fully expecting to recover that here in the back half of the year. But a lot of strength in the North America business for sure. And I would be remiss if I didn't point out the margin performance of north of 29% operating margin. So a really strong quarter for the welding business, and Q3 is looking really good so far. We are still -- there is a lag here, as you know, from the time we see the cost increases to the price is being realized. That is somewhere between 1 to 2 quarters, and we are still in catch-up mode here in the second half of the year. Obviously, on a margin basis, we talked about that and also on a dollar basis. I think as we sit here today, I think that's a reasonable expectation, yes. Yes. I think you're right, Steve. There is a lot going on. What I can tell you is that as we kind of peel back the onion on our incrementals, so adjusting for all the things you just talked about, MTS, restructuring and price/cost, we are right back at our core incremental margins in that 35% range right now, and we wouldn't expect anything different in 2023. Obviously, we haven't done the planning yet, but that's kind of long term what you should expect from us is incrementals in that 35% range. I think it's a little too early, Mig. I mean, clearly, there will be some carryover. But to try and quantify that right now for you, I don't think would be helpful. Yes. I mean, I think the only thing I would point back to is what I said in these prepared remarks is that if you add up the price/cost margin dilution impact during this cycle over this year and last year of about 250 basis points, the expectation is that as things begin to normalize, we will recover that margin impact over time. Now how exactly that will play out and the timing around that is not entire clear as we sit here today. But there will be -- I think it's reasonable to assume that some of that impact will be in 2023. Yes. I agree with that, Mig. I mean, I think if you look at the results we put up so far, and granted there's some recovery in here, but last year, organic was up 12%. The first half is up 10% organic this year. I think relative to peers, we're certainly closing the gap compared to where we were kind of just a few years ago. So I think yes, the proof will be in the organic growth rate numbers that we're going to put up. But I also will tell you there is a high degree of confidence that we are making significant progress. Lots more to do, but certainly, we are headed in the right direction here for sure. Yes. I mean, the big driver for the second half here is what we just talked about, which is 200 basis points of price/cost margin dilution impact in the first half, that's not projected to repeat in the second half. So that's probably the biggest driver. I think you also have to factor in -- if you just run rate -- if you just take our current revenues and project those into Q3 and Q4 because the comps are easing on a year-over-year basis, we'll be putting up some meaningful organic growth rates with all the operating leverage and the incrementals that are returning to something a lot closer to our historical incrementals in the back half of the year. And so those are kind of the big drivers here, less price/cost margin headwind and significant organic growth year-over-year with more normal incremental margins in that 35%, maybe plus range for the back half of the year. It's a little bigger than usual. I mean, as you know, historically, our second half cash flows are always significantly higher than the first half. It's a little bit more this time. We've talked about the fact that we've been very intentional in terms of our working capital investments to support the growth that we're seeing double-digit growth at the top line, mitigate supply chain risk, which is still a reality and then sustain the service levels for our customers. So we will carry whatever inventory we need to do those things. If you look at our months on hand, we're running right around 3 months on hand. And we really only need a slight improvement in that in the months on hand to get to those free cash flow numbers. So as we sit here today, we do have a line of sight to a ramp-up in the second half. But like I said, we think it's a smart use of this balance sheet to support everything we're trying to do from an organic growth standpoint by taking care of our customers. And I will say this, if we come in at the low end of the range, it won't change anything in terms of our capital allocation plans for the year. We'll still do the buyback. We'll still do, obviously, investments. We'll still do the dividend. And so there's really no trade-off here. But obviously, we'd like to hit the free cash flow number, and we have line of sight to doing that for the back half of the year. And we are obviously aware that it's a little bit more of a ramp than what we normally have."

            "content": "Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The ITW team delivered another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance with organic growth of 10.4%, operating margin of 23.1%, after-tax return on invested capital of 27.8% and GAAP EPS of $2.37. In the second quarter, we saw continued strong demand across our portfolio, supported by our 80/20 front-to-back driven operational capabilities. Our teams continue to do an exceptional job of delivering for our customers and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth. As a result of our advantaged operational execution and delivery performance, we are being rewarded with meaningful additional share by our customers as evidenced by our 10.5% organic growth in the first half of this year. While input cost inflation and supply chain issues remain challenging, we did see some stabilization on both fronts in Q2. In fact, for the first time in 2 years, price/cost margin dilution headwind improved sequentially from negative 250 basis points in Q1 to negative 160 basis points in Q2 as our businesses continue to do an excellent job of adjusting price to offset input cost inflation, and the pace and magnitude of input cost increases moderated somewhat. Importantly, our teams delivered these strong operational and financial results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy. And they delivered another 90 basis points of margin improvement from enterprise initiatives in the quarter. Based on our first half results and projecting current demand and supply rates through the balance of the year, we are maintaining our guidance for full year 2022, with organic growth of 8.5% at the midpoint, margins in the range of 24% to 25% and GAAP EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint, which would be an all-time record for the company. Excluding onetime tax items in both years, this represents EPS growth of 12%. While the near-term environment remains challenging and the global macro is certainly uncertain, ITW remains strongly positioned to continue to deliver differentiated performance for our shareholders, differentiated service to our customers and continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential performance through the back half of the year and beyond. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will provide more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Michael? I was going to say, I think Michael told you exactly where we're seeing it, which is a couple of pockets. One is the auto aftermarket business for reasons that are pretty logical related to the gas prices and consumers' discretionary spending in that arena and then the other is our international construction businesses that we did see a little bit of a pullback. Those 2 -- those businesses combined represent, I think, less than 15% of the company's overall revenues. And for the other 85%, we see things remain very strong. And decrease -- Yes. The biggest positions we have in both of those markets is by far residential. So I think they mostly speak to what's going on in those markets in the residential side in both Europe and Australia. And just maybe a little additional color. The real strike there in Q2 is the Industrial side. I think, Jeff, part of your question was related to the channel, and that's not a product -- a category of products that typically is inventory in a significant degree of the channel. These are larger, more complex products, machines and systems and they are typically sold into end users for specific projects. So there's not a lot of channel inventory at any point on those products. We do almost -- yes. Sorry to cut you off, Scott. I'll let you finish your question. I was just going to say, we are producing locally to sell locally. We do very little cross-border commerce, either on the input side or the export side. There's a little bit here and there, but less than 5% of our revenue. It's something like. Yes, it's something like 2% of our imports are from China. I mean, it's really de minimis. We are produced where we sell a company. Our suppliers are local, our customers are local so our exposure is largely translation. So we are sourcing in the same currency that we are producing and selling in the vast majority of cases. I think, Joe, we really highlighted the 2 big ones, which is construction, residential and then the automotive aftermarket business. The other one maybe that I would add is in our specialty business, we do a fair amount of consumer packaging. So beverages and resealable closures for things like cheese and other food products that I think have generally proven to be pretty resilient during times of economic contraction, consumer staples basically. What I would say overall is we have no visibility to any improvement. We are not planning on it. I'm sure that it will get better at some point. I think we have been -- our business has been very resilient in terms of working their way through various issues and challenges, computer chips, you name it. And we are finding a way to serve our customers, and that's that remains, I think, the posture that we have. And until it changes, we're not changing what we're doing and I think we're on it, but it's still not easy. We've got to get it to our planning process, which is really we're talking about November-ish before we'll have a reasonable view on that, and I think that's the appropriate time. Well, I don't know exactly what I can do to reassure you other than to tell you that it continues to be the #1 dominant priority of every member of ITW from China to Europe to North America to South America, and it is, certainly, we think we've got a terrific opportunity going forward. We have done a lot of things in terms of investing and positioning ourselves to execute on it and the proof will be in the pudding. But it's already happening."

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the ITW Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, David. Good morning everyone, and welcome to ITW\u2019s first quarter 2022 conference call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss ITW\u2019s first quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2022. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2021 Form 10-K for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. So please turn to slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thanks Karen, and good morning, everyone. We have talked often about the fact that the core focus of our enterprise strategy is to leverage the performance power of the ITW business model to consistently deliver top-tier performance in any environment. And our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of doing just that as evidenced by the 11% organic growth and 23% operating margins that they delivered in Q1. In the quarter we saw continued strong demand almost across the board while input cost inflation and supply chain issues remain challenging to say the least and our business has responded. Across the company, we continue to leverage the advantaged supply capabilities inherent in our 80/20 front-to-back operating system to support our customers and execute our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. Many of our businesses continued to receive strong feedback from their customers that their current delivery performance is truly differentiated and that they are being awarded additional share as a result. And despite another step-up in input cost inflation in Q1, we more than offset cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the quarter. Looking ahead at the remainder of 2022 based on our first quarter results and projecting current demand, supply rates and all-known cost increases through the balance of the year, we are raising our guidance for full year 2022 organic growth to 8.5% at the midpoint and GAAP EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint, which is 14% earnings growth year-over-year and would be an all-time record for the company. While the near-term environment certainly has its challenges, we remain focused on delivering differentiated service to our customers, differentiated financial performance for our shareholders and continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael, who'll provide more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. In Q1 demand was strong across the board and supported by our advantaged supply position, ITW grew revenue by 11.2% to more than $3.9 billion. Organic growth was 10.6% and the MTS acquisition contributed about $100 million, or 2.8% to revenue. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 2.2%. GAAP EPS of $2.11 tied last year's Q1 record. Foreign currency translation reduced GAAP EPS by $0.05. By geography, North America grew 13%, international grew 7% with organic growth of 7% in Europe, and China grew 1%. Six of seven segments delivered positive combined organic growth of 14%, while Automotive OEM was down less than 1%. Orders remained strong across the board. And while we're doing significantly better than many of our competitors in terms of lead times and delivery performance, we grew backlogs again in the first quarter. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, organic revenue grew 6% on a sales per day basis, as compared to our historical sequential of minus 1%. And while we're on the topic of sequential improvement GAAP EPS of $2.11 grew 9% relative to Q4 2021. Operating margin was 22.7%, 23.4%, excluding 70 basis points of margin dilution from the recent MTS acquisition. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 90 basis points. And as we always do our business teams reacted appropriately to higher cost inflation by adjusting selling prices. And as a result, we remain positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Price/cost was still dilutive to operating margin by 250 basis points. After-tax ROIC was 27.6%, 29.8%, excluding the impact of the MTS acquisition. Free cash flow was $249 million with a conversion rate of 38%, which is below our typical 80% to 85% in the first quarter. As we've talked about before, the lower conversion rate is due to intentional working capital investments that support our strong growth momentum mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. And down the road once supply conditions begin to normalize, so will our working capital needs resulting in our typical strong cash flow performance. As planned, we repurchased $375 million of our shares in the first quarter and the effective tax rate was 23.1%, 70 basis points higher than Q1 last year. So, overall, for Q1 an excellent start to the year, characterized by strong broad-based demand supported by our differentiated supply position, as we delivered organic growth of 11%, operating margin of 23%, and GAAP EPS of $2.11. Moving to Slide 4. We're including an analysis of our current operating margin performance. Reported Q1 operating margin was 22.7%, but there are three factors pressuring our margins in the near term starting with 250 basis points of margin dilution impact from price cost. At some point in the future when raw material costs begin to normalize, we expect the margin impact from price/cost to turn positive and that we will fully recover the margin differential. Second, Q1 was also the first full quarter of the recent MTS acquisition, which as expected diluted margins by 70 basis points. As we've talked about before, it will take us a few years to fully implement the ITW business model on MTS and get the business growing organically at ITW caliber margins and returns. Finally, we had slightly higher restructuring associated with 80/20 front-to-back projects, which impacted margins by 20 basis points. And the point here is that our core operating margins are currently running around 26%-plus, which is closer to what we would expect from ITW in a normal environment and not far from our pre-pandemic target of 28%-plus and also further evidence of our continued progress on enterprise strategy driven structural margin improvement through the pandemic. If you recall 2019 pre-pandemic margins were right around 24% versus 26% on a core run rate basis here in Q1. And as we've said before, we have full confidence in our ability to deliver sustained above-market organic growth at 30% to 40% incremental margins. And as a result, we will continue to expand operating margins as we grow. Moving on. Automotive OEM was the only segment that didn't grow this quarter with organic revenue down a little less than 1% much improved compared to being down 16% in Q4 2021. By geography, North America grew 3%, Europe was down 11% and China grew 12%. You'll remember that the segment is up against a pretty tough comp of plus 8% organic growth in Q1 last year as the impact on auto production from chip shortages didn't fully materialize until Q2. At this point and for guidance purposes, we do not expect an improvement in the chip shortage situation until 2023. As a result, our guidance assumes that automotive production and our associated automotive OEM revenues are essentially capped at current Q1 levels through the balance of the year. Turning to slide 5 for Food Equipment, which led the way with the highest organic growth rate this quarter at 28%. North America was up 23% with Equipment up 24% and Service up 21%. Restaurants were up over 40% with strength across the board and institutional growth was almost 10% led by education and lodging. International growth was strong at 36% with Europe up 45% and Asia Pacific up 4%. Both Equipment and Service revenues increased around 36%. In Test and Measurement and Electronics, organic growth was 8% with Test and Measurement up 10% and Electronics up 6%. Strong demand for semiconductor-related equipment continued to drive organic growth in the mid-teens, while demand for capital equipment also remained strong with Instron, for example, up 6%. Finally, as expected the MTS acquisition diluted operating margin by about 400 basis points. Excluding the MTS impact margins were 26% versus 26.4% in Q4 2021. Moving to slide 6. Welding organic revenue grew 13% with Equipment up 10% and Consumables up 17%. Industrial grew 14% and the Commercial business grew almost 10%. North America was up 12% and International growth was 17% including 18% growth in oil and gas. Europe was up 20% and Asia Pacific was up 15%. Due to strong operating leverage and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives, Welding operating margin was a record 30.8% an all-time quarterly record for an ITW segment and another proof point that as we deliver organic growth with best-in-class margins there's plenty of room for further margin expansion in all seven segments. In Polymers and Fluids, organic growth was 13%, as automotive aftermarket grew 17%. Polymers was up 11% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Fluids grew 6%. On a geographic basis North America grew 15% and International was up 9%. On to Slide 7. Construction delivered strong organic revenue growth of 21% as North America grew 32% with Residential up 36% and Commercial up 15%. Europe grew 16% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%. While construction margins were impacted by rising steel costs, operating margin was still a solid 24.7% with strong volume leverage and a meaningful contribution from enterprise initiatives. Specialty organic growth was 1% with North America up 7%, while International was down 9%. With that let's turn to Slide 8 for an updated view of our full year 2022 guidance. And based on our Q1 results and projecting current levels of demand through the balance of the year as per our standard approach to guidance, we are now projecting organic growth of 7% to 10% and total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11.5%. Due to the higher revenue growth projections, we're raising GAAP EPS by $0.10 to a range of $9 to $9.40 and the midpoint of $9.20 represents, 14% earnings growth and puts the company on track for another year of record financial performance. Operating margin guidance is unchanged with strong volume leverage and 100 basis points of contribution from enterprise initiatives. When it comes to price cost our operating teams will continue to more than cover inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And as usual, our guidance includes all known costs and price increases as we sit here today. We expect strong free cash flow growth of 10% to 20% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 85% to 95% of net income. As we've talked about before this is below our target of 100%-plus. Because of our decision to invest in the working capital necessary to support the company's strong growth mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. Finally, we are on pace to repurchase 1.5 billion of our shares and we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. So, in summary Q1 was another quarter of high-quality execution in a very challenging environment and as a result, we're off to a solid start on raising both our organic growth and EPS guidance for the full year.  So, with that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. \nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks Michael. David let's open up the lines for questions please. \nOperator:   [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Good morning, guys.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nScott Davis: Thanks for making an uneventful quarter versus what we've seen in some other places. \nScott Santi: You're welcome. \nScott Davis: A couple of little things here. I mean first your guidance implies kind of - or perhaps doesn't imply, but you're not forecasting additional inflation. Does that mean that you've seen kind of some plateauing in the supply chain price increases and materials etcetera? \nMichael Larsen: Well -- so let me just -- it's a good question. So let me just explain kind of how we are modeling price cost because I think there's an opportunity to maybe clarify a few things. So, what we are doing consistent with our past approach around price/cost is we're including in our guidance today. all known cost increases and all of the associate price increases. Those are the two things that we know today. And based on that you saw the actuals of 250 basis points of margin headwind in the first quarter, but actually positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As we project into the future based on what we know today, that 250 basis points is going to become less of a drag on a go-forward basis and maybe even turn slightly positive in the back half of the year, okay? So that's kind of -- that's what we know. What we don't know and that's to your question what are the additional cost increases going to be? We don't know as we sit here today, we have not seen anything to really suggest that inflation is slowing down. But we do know that our operating teams will offset any cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And so therefore, EPS-neutral which is a really important point here. But obviously, that will create additional top line growth, but it will also put pressure on margins as this additional top line growth comes through at essentially no incremental margin if that makes sense. So, hopefully that answers your question. So that's what's embedded here. Everything we know as we sit here today is included in our guidance. Additional inflation will be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And to the extent that happens that will put some further pressure on margins. And so hopefully that answers your question.\nScott Davis: That's totally fair. Is there any way to disaggregate the content growth in auto versus kind of potential inventory builds versus sell-through et cetera? Just any color there will be helpful...\nScott Santi: I'd say at this point, that would be really tough, just given all that's going on.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I agree with that. I would just add. I mean, I think it's a tough number and it doesn't make a lot of sense on a quarterly basis. I think in terms of long term, we're highly confident that we're outgrowing the underlying market by two to three percentage points. What exactly that was in one quarter versus the other is a little bit more difficult to ascertain, especially in the current environment. But on a full year basis, certainly, the way these plans are set up is for two to three percentage points of outgrowth on an annual basis.\nScott Davis: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color.\nScott Santi: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to get some clarity on the improved organic growth guidance you're raising it by one point. And is that a reflection of better-than-expected first quarter performance versus your internal expectations or does it embed improved organic growth you're seeing quarter-to-date? And if the latter, which segments are driving that? And is it solely coming from incremental pricing or are you expecting volume improvement as well?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So Tami, our growth projection is based on the Q1 actual results that we are reporting today. And then we are projecting based on historical run rates into -- through the balance of the year. So there's really no assumption here, no economic forecasts or an underlying assumptions, things are going to get better in the back half or worse than the back half of the year. It's based on again revenue per day in Q1 and projected into -- through the balance of the year.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. And so, you're not embedding any pricing benefit into the updated guidance?\nMichael Larsen: No. I think the only pricing that is included in our guidance is what we know as of today. So we know, what price increases we have actioned and announced and so that is known. But any further increases beyond that would not be included in our guidance as we sit here today.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Super helpful. If I can ask one more follow-up?\nScott Santi: Sure.\nTami Zakaria: Have you seen any slowdown or impact in your business in the European markets since the war in Ukraine broke? Ask another way have you do you feel the demand environment has changed since then?\nMichael Larsen: Well, so I think in Q1 I think Europe was up 7%. I think we're seeing -- we saw some pressure. In -- if you look at the automotive numbers the sales numbers -- we saw a lot of strength on the food equipment side to offset that. I think and if you kind of look at the projection for the balance of the year, I think it adds up to somewhere in the low single-digit type growth rate in Europe. Just to maybe comment or put it down, I think so far through April, everything appears to be on track including Europe.\nTami Zakaria: Great. Thank you so much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everybody.\nScott Santi: Good morning Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: I guess my first question I want to just touch on China, I know it's a relatively small part of your business. I saw that it grew double-digits in the auto business. But maybe just provide some color on what you're seeing on the ground there with the COVID shutdowns and how that's impacting your business if at all?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I mean I think just to kind of dimensionalize it. China is about 8% of our revenues and I think we -- at this point, we've not seen -- we're obviously not immune to what's going on in China. But like I said so far through April, everything appears to be on track including in China.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Good to know. And then I guess just a follow-on question. You guys price/cost negative 250, but only down 100 basis points for the year. I mean it's fair to say I think like where you're seeing the most acute pressure in the auto OEM segment. So, I guess, just maybe confirm that that's correct or if you're seeing other pressure across other parts of your business as well? And then just within that improvement that you're seeing, how much of it is already like baked into the pricing of those auto contracts that come through as the year progresses?\nMichael Larsen: So ,everything that we know is baked in Joe. So and I think the -- it's fair to say that the inflationary pressures are real across all seven segments. They are a little more pronounced as you can see it in the margins in auto, maybe construction this quarter I mentioned that as well as Polymers & Fluids. I think there is a little bit of a -- we're still catching up to some extent. So, the 250 basis points of headwind will be better starting in Q2 based on what we know today somewhere closer to 200 and then from there in the back half if things stay the way they are like I said earlier we're starting to turn positive. And we're beginning -- I think the important point is we're beginning to recover the margin impact that we've had over the last four or five quarters now. So, I think once we get through this cycle like I said in the prepared remarks and when things do begin to normalize down the road from a supply chain and from a cost standpoint that is when the margin recovery begins. And so we're taking to some extent this is a -- we described it as a near-term pressure here in Q1 and over time we'll begin to recover those margins again.\nJoe Ritchie: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just first on auto Scott or Michael. Is the idea that you're capped here what you're hearing directly from your customers, what you can see on kind of forward build schedules, or is this just for lack of a better term a dose of caution given the uncertainty?\nMichael Larsen: It's a combination of things. I think Jeff, if you go back to our last call the -- what was baked into our guidance at the time was half of the IHS growth build forecast of 9%. So we were basically at somewhere around 4% to 5% builds. And that's where IHS is today. So I think there's actually not a big change relative to where we were three months ago. And what we're basically based on various data inputs including from our customers, we thought the best way to update kind of forecast the auto business is to say that revenues stay where they are which is somewhere around $760 million in Q1 and that's what we've assumed for Q2, Q3 and Q4. So -- and then ultimately, I mean we still believe that down the road, when these supply chain issues get resolved and automotive production recovers, this segment is going to be very well set up as a strong contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise. But we just think it's going to take a little bit longer based on everything that we are seeing and hearing from our customers.\nJeff Sprague: Understood. And then just back on price. Understanding that what you know is embedded in the guide, but if we think about the point addition to the organic growth guide, I suspect all of that maybe even more than 100% of it is price. Could you just give us a little color on that?\nMichael Larsen: So I think you tried this on the last call to get me to tell you a little bit more about price versus volume. So -- and just to reiterate, these are our best estimates. So I can't give you a lot of detail other than I can tell you that the -- there is volume leverage on the 1% revenue growth increase and that's really the 10% -- $0.10 a share that we're adding to our guidance, okay? So it is not -- from that you can infer, it's not all price. It's a combination of things.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Understood. Thank you for the color.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nMichael Larsen: Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Scott or Michael, so I know you probably don't want to update us on your segment revenue growth expectations. But outside of auto where you already gave a specific guide, it looks like Food Equipment & Construction accelerated versus your run rate specialty products maybe weakened a bit. Is that a fair characterization of where revenue growth is moving versus your original forecast? And can you give a little more color regarding what you're seeing in specialty products that's maybe holding down that business a bit segment?\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. I think the -- I heard your first part. What the second part was what did you say slowdown?\nAndy Kaplowitz: Specialty. \nMichael Larsen: Specialty. Yeah, I think specialty is really more of a timing issue related to some specific equipment projects in Europe and a few projects in China. So I think that's really more of a timing issue than anything else. I think if you just kind of take a step back I think you pointed out the right ones, in terms of a lot of strength in certainly Food Equipment, but also Welding. Test & Measurement there's some -- up against some difficult comps. Construction, there's certainly a lot of positive momentum, really across the board. And what does not come across and we've talked about this before, we're not a backlog-driven company. But in the segments that are more exposed to the capital equipment space, so that would include Test & Measurement, Welding, Food & Equipment, we are building significant backlog and really despite the fact that we are performing, like I said, at a high level relative to our competitors, we're building substantial backlog. That's not showing up, obviously, yet in our revenues.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And, Michael, you obviously had -- you had a large number in construction, specifically, you mentioned North American renovation, I think, up in the low 30% range. It's been going on for a while here, but this is a big number and you're getting stronger despite sort of concerns about rising rates. So are you taking share there? Is it just a lot of activity and sort of visibility going forward here in 2022?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think as you know, I mean, there's still a lot of strength in the US housing market and that's where you saw these residential remodel numbers up 36%. And included in that is also some meaningful share gains, based on what we're seeing in portions of that business, where it's difficult to supply the market, we are taking advantage of our supply position to take share. The commercial side, 15%, that's a smaller part of the business. And then, really, on a geographic basis, it's not just North America, but it's also Europe, up 16%. For example, the UK up 20%; and then Australia and New Zealand still delivering a solid 10%. So it's pretty broad-based and again, we're modeling based on run rates. And so, we have not seen anything to suggest that the market is slowing down at this point.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate the color.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nNigel Coe: And thanks for leaving a lot of time for -- yes, good morning. It's actually great that you give so much time to Q&A. So thanks, I wish all other company to do this. So, I know you don't like to talk about price. And I know Jeff took a crack at the question. But if I just put through the margin dilution from price/costs and it seem as neutral, then I get to a 9%, 10% type price impact. Is that the kind of scale of pricing we're seeing here? And is the message that pricing gets better from here through the year?\nMichael Larsen: Well, what does get better from here, if things stay the way they are, is price/cost as we talked about. And so, we're going from significant margin dilution here in Q1 of 250 basis points to maybe even slightly positive in the second half of the year. So that's -- and that's based on everything that we know today. And Nigel, it's not that we don't want to -- so the issue around price is that, it is an estimate at best. And it is not -- especially with -- in such a dynamic environment it would be very difficult to sit here and give you a number with a high degree of confidence and we\u2019ve not done that historically. And like, I think, we talked about on the last call, we're not going to go down the path of breaking out price versus volume any further. So that's the best I can do here for you.\nNigel Coe: Okay. No, that's fine. And then, just turn to page 4 as my follow-up the margin bridge. Enterprise was I think 90 bps of tailwinds. So if we put that in as sort of a tailwind to that bridge there would have been 90 bps elsewhere so -- as an offset. So, I'm assuming that productivity in the plans, et cetera, is that fair Michael? And how do you see sort of productivity, labor productivity, et cetera, improving through the year?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think that's productivity. I'm not sure exactly how you get there. I mean I think there's 90 basis points of enterprise initiatives that's not on here.\nScott Santi: That's embedded in the 26.1%.\nMichael Larsen: In the 26.1%. And so, is the -- any other productivity gains. There's a couple of things that are nodding here is there's some margin dilution from increased sales commissions. When you grow your revenues double-digit, your commissions are going to go up. But broadly speaking, what we try to do is give you a fairly accurate representation of these near-term pressures and therefore, what our core operating margins are running at, which is somewhere around 26%-plus in the current environment. And as we just talked about these price/cost pressures normalize, that's where we would expect margins to head as we continue on our path to our target of 28%-plus.\nNigel Coe: No, that\u2019s very clear. Thank you very much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.\nMig Dobre: Good morning, everyone. So, Michael a question for you. I think I heard you mention that in the second quarter, the price/cost headwind moderates to the tune of about 50 basis points. So when we're thinking about year-over-year margin, is it fair to still embed roughly 200 basis points of year-over-year compression in Q2 and then things get better in the back half basically?\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. I think that's what I said. Yeah, I think that's a -- based again with the caveat that we are in a very dynamic uncertain environment. But to the extent that -- based on what we know today that is -- that would be correct.\nMig Dobre: Okay. And then, sorry to keep beating up this topic on price. It's just that this environment, it's not something I've encountered in my career well frankly before. But when we're looking at PPI data, I mean we're seeing some pretty material increases in Food Equipment in Welding. And I'm sort of wondering if your business is sort of kind of keeping up with this industry data as well or if there are some divergence that we need to be aware of, because it would seem that most of the growth is really coming from pricing not volume if volume grows at all in 2022?\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. I mean, I...\nScott Santi: We wouldn't share that view.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. We don't agree with that one. Two, I'm not quite sure what you're -- what data you're looking at. So it's a little bit difficult for me to comment. All I can do is report the actual results for our Food Equipment business, for example. And I think we give you a fair bit of detail including by end market. And beyond that I can't really -- like I said before, we don't report price versus volume and so I'm not sure I can help you.\nMig Dobre: Understood. Maybe one last follow-up. I'm curious as to how you're thinking about this pricing dynamic longer term? Because to your point eventually we're going to start to see material costs coming down, do you expect to be able to keep the pricing gains that you have had in this environment, or is it fair to assume some pressure is weakened about 2023 and beyond? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Well, so, I think let me just start by saying that our customer relationships are strategic long-term relationships. We're not trying to maximize price. We're trying to serve our customers and make sure that we get paid for offering a really differentiated product service or solution. So we've always had pricing power in these businesses. I think ultimately, these are going to be discussions with customers when costs start to normalize and there might be a few exceptions, but by and large, we expect to hold on to these price increases to recover the margins like I said earlier. So that's typically what happens. If you go back and look in time, we're going to end up with a period where we recover that margin percentage and we don't expect the current cycle to be any different.\nMig Dobre: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to try and understand the sort of earnings framework for the year a little bit. So it looks as if sort of operating margins are set to go up by about 300 basis points between kind of Q1 and Q4 with a flattish dollar revenue. Is that all simply the price cost removal of the headwind? Is there any other kind of major moving parts? And also to that point, are you sticking to that kind of 47-53 first half second half EPS split?\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. So let me address that. I mean, I think, we're still in that 46% to 47% in the first half and the balance in the second half. And the big driver really is, what we've talked about it feels like for a while here is price/cost beginning to turn positive, based again on the assumptions that we're making in our guidance. So that's the drive. Now historically, we do 49%, 51%. So it's a couple of percentage points. So, but it is a little bit more back-end loaded. We expect that as we go through the year, sequentially starting in Q2 margins will improve and so will revenues. And that's just based again on kind of historical run rates. And so we expect a steady kind of improvement in Q2, Q3 and in Q4 including on the margin side. Whether it's exactly the number you laid out, I can't really comment. But directionally that's \u2013 that is the right way to look at it.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks, Michael. And then switching to the balance sheet, which I don't think has been touched on yet, and maybe some customer element as well. But your inventories are up, I think almost sort of 50% year-on-year, and up 10%-plus sequentially in Q1. Just kind of trying to understand, when do you think that starts to level out? And this major sort of inventory build that you're seeing how assure you that you're not seeing the same phenomenon across your customers and channel partners, as well with obviously some risk to that, if we do see final demand slowdown?\nMichael Larsen: Well, so I think if you look at our inventory levels, we were running at about three months on hand. Our historical is two months. And so we have an extra month of inventory on hand. And I think we've been very clear about why that is. It's to mitigate supply chain risk, it's to take care of our customers and ultimately to win this recovery and take share at a point where our competitors are maybe not able to service our customers. So that's the vast majority of these inventory increases, just kind of maybe a little housekeeping. If you look at our conversion rate here in Q1 the difference between the 38% and the 80% to 85% is about $300 million of working capital very intentional investments. We believe a really smart use of our balance sheet. And you saw the top line growth, right at 11% organic this quarter. That I would argue would not have happened if we've not taken this approach starting really last year to make a conscious decision to invest in inventory. And then, obviously, receivables will go up as you grow double-digit. Ultimately, we don't see any reason why structurally when supply chain begins to normalize both from an availability standpoint and also from a cost standpoint that we will go back to two months on hand. And at that point if that happens you'll see these free cash flow numbers will deliver above-average performance, until we're back to kind of normal levels. So we view this really as a temporary increase in working capital.  How quickly that will come down, depends on a lot of things, including what you're talking about and -- which is inventory in the channel where we really don't have a lot of visibility. Other than I can tell you, for the most part the channel does not carry a lot of inventory because they're used to the fact that we will take care of them when they need products. So there's no incentive for them to carry a lot of extra inventory. So, that's probably the best I can give you Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: That's perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for your participating in today's conference call. All lines may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you Scott and good morning everyone. In Q1 demand was strong across the board and supported by our advantaged supply position, ITW grew revenue by 11.2% to more than $3.9 billion. Organic growth was 10.6% and the MTS acquisition contributed about $100 million, or 2.8% to revenue. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 2.2%. GAAP EPS of $2.11 tied last year's Q1 record. Foreign currency translation reduced GAAP EPS by $0.05. By geography, North America grew 13%, international grew 7% with organic growth of 7% in Europe, and China grew 1%. Six of seven segments delivered positive combined organic growth of 14%, while Automotive OEM was down less than 1%. Orders remained strong across the board. And while we're doing significantly better than many of our competitors in terms of lead times and delivery performance, we grew backlogs again in the first quarter. Sequentially from Q4 to Q1, organic revenue grew 6% on a sales per day basis, as compared to our historical sequential of minus 1%. And while we're on the topic of sequential improvement GAAP EPS of $2.11 grew 9% relative to Q4 2021. Operating margin was 22.7%, 23.4%, excluding 70 basis points of margin dilution from the recent MTS acquisition. Enterprise Initiatives contributed 90 basis points. And as we always do our business teams reacted appropriately to higher cost inflation by adjusting selling prices. And as a result, we remain positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Price/cost was still dilutive to operating margin by 250 basis points. After-tax ROIC was 27.6%, 29.8%, excluding the impact of the MTS acquisition. Free cash flow was $249 million with a conversion rate of 38%, which is below our typical 80% to 85% in the first quarter. As we've talked about before, the lower conversion rate is due to intentional working capital investments that support our strong growth momentum mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. And down the road once supply conditions begin to normalize, so will our working capital needs resulting in our typical strong cash flow performance. As planned, we repurchased $375 million of our shares in the first quarter and the effective tax rate was 23.1%, 70 basis points higher than Q1 last year. So, overall, for Q1 an excellent start to the year, characterized by strong broad-based demand supported by our differentiated supply position, as we delivered organic growth of 11%, operating margin of 23%, and GAAP EPS of $2.11. Moving to Slide 4. We're including an analysis of our current operating margin performance. Reported Q1 operating margin was 22.7%, but there are three factors pressuring our margins in the near term starting with 250 basis points of margin dilution impact from price cost. At some point in the future when raw material costs begin to normalize, we expect the margin impact from price/cost to turn positive and that we will fully recover the margin differential. Second, Q1 was also the first full quarter of the recent MTS acquisition, which as expected diluted margins by 70 basis points. As we've talked about before, it will take us a few years to fully implement the ITW business model on MTS and get the business growing organically at ITW caliber margins and returns. Finally, we had slightly higher restructuring associated with 80/20 front-to-back projects, which impacted margins by 20 basis points. And the point here is that our core operating margins are currently running around 26%-plus, which is closer to what we would expect from ITW in a normal environment and not far from our pre-pandemic target of 28%-plus and also further evidence of our continued progress on enterprise strategy driven structural margin improvement through the pandemic. If you recall 2019 pre-pandemic margins were right around 24% versus 26% on a core run rate basis here in Q1. And as we've said before, we have full confidence in our ability to deliver sustained above-market organic growth at 30% to 40% incremental margins. And as a result, we will continue to expand operating margins as we grow. Moving on. Automotive OEM was the only segment that didn't grow this quarter with organic revenue down a little less than 1% much improved compared to being down 16% in Q4 2021. By geography, North America grew 3%, Europe was down 11% and China grew 12%. You'll remember that the segment is up against a pretty tough comp of plus 8% organic growth in Q1 last year as the impact on auto production from chip shortages didn't fully materialize until Q2. At this point and for guidance purposes, we do not expect an improvement in the chip shortage situation until 2023. As a result, our guidance assumes that automotive production and our associated automotive OEM revenues are essentially capped at current Q1 levels through the balance of the year. Turning to slide 5 for Food Equipment, which led the way with the highest organic growth rate this quarter at 28%. North America was up 23% with Equipment up 24% and Service up 21%. Restaurants were up over 40% with strength across the board and institutional growth was almost 10% led by education and lodging. International growth was strong at 36% with Europe up 45% and Asia Pacific up 4%. Both Equipment and Service revenues increased around 36%. In Test and Measurement and Electronics, organic growth was 8% with Test and Measurement up 10% and Electronics up 6%. Strong demand for semiconductor-related equipment continued to drive organic growth in the mid-teens, while demand for capital equipment also remained strong with Instron, for example, up 6%. Finally, as expected the MTS acquisition diluted operating margin by about 400 basis points. Excluding the MTS impact margins were 26% versus 26.4% in Q4 2021. Moving to slide 6. Welding organic revenue grew 13% with Equipment up 10% and Consumables up 17%. Industrial grew 14% and the Commercial business grew almost 10%. North America was up 12% and International growth was 17% including 18% growth in oil and gas. Europe was up 20% and Asia Pacific was up 15%. Due to strong operating leverage and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives, Welding operating margin was a record 30.8% an all-time quarterly record for an ITW segment and another proof point that as we deliver organic growth with best-in-class margins there's plenty of room for further margin expansion in all seven segments. In Polymers and Fluids, organic growth was 13%, as automotive aftermarket grew 17%. Polymers was up 11% with continued strength in MRO and heavy industry applications. Fluids grew 6%. On a geographic basis North America grew 15% and International was up 9%. On to Slide 7. Construction delivered strong organic revenue growth of 21% as North America grew 32% with Residential up 36% and Commercial up 15%. Europe grew 16% and Australia and New Zealand was up 10%. While construction margins were impacted by rising steel costs, operating margin was still a solid 24.7% with strong volume leverage and a meaningful contribution from enterprise initiatives. Specialty organic growth was 1% with North America up 7%, while International was down 9%. With that let's turn to Slide 8 for an updated view of our full year 2022 guidance. And based on our Q1 results and projecting current levels of demand through the balance of the year as per our standard approach to guidance, we are now projecting organic growth of 7% to 10% and total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11.5%. Due to the higher revenue growth projections, we're raising GAAP EPS by $0.10 to a range of $9 to $9.40 and the midpoint of $9.20 represents, 14% earnings growth and puts the company on track for another year of record financial performance. Operating margin guidance is unchanged with strong volume leverage and 100 basis points of contribution from enterprise initiatives. When it comes to price cost our operating teams will continue to more than cover inflation on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And as usual, our guidance includes all known costs and price increases as we sit here today. We expect strong free cash flow growth of 10% to 20% year-over-year with a conversion rate of 85% to 95% of net income. As we've talked about before this is below our target of 100%-plus. Because of our decision to invest in the working capital necessary to support the company's strong growth mitigate supply chain risk and sustained service levels to our key customers. Finally, we are on pace to repurchase 1.5 billion of our shares and we continue to expect an effective tax rate of 23% to 24%. So, in summary Q1 was another quarter of high-quality execution in a very challenging environment and as a result, we're off to a solid start on raising both our organic growth and EPS guidance for the full year.  So, with that Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Well -- so let me just -- it's a good question. So let me just explain kind of how we are modeling price cost because I think there's an opportunity to maybe clarify a few things. So, what we are doing consistent with our past approach around price/cost is we're including in our guidance today. all known cost increases and all of the associate price increases. Those are the two things that we know today. And based on that you saw the actuals of 250 basis points of margin headwind in the first quarter, but actually positive on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As we project into the future based on what we know today, that 250 basis points is going to become less of a drag on a go-forward basis and maybe even turn slightly positive in the back half of the year, okay? So that's kind of -- that's what we know. What we don't know and that's to your question what are the additional cost increases going to be? We don't know as we sit here today, we have not seen anything to really suggest that inflation is slowing down. But we do know that our operating teams will offset any cost increases with price on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And so therefore, EPS-neutral which is a really important point here. But obviously, that will create additional top line growth, but it will also put pressure on margins as this additional top line growth comes through at essentially no incremental margin if that makes sense. So, hopefully that answers your question. So that's what's embedded here. Everything we know as we sit here today is included in our guidance. Additional inflation will be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis. And to the extent that happens that will put some further pressure on margins. And so hopefully that answers your question. Yes, I agree with that. I would just add. I mean, I think it's a tough number and it doesn't make a lot of sense on a quarterly basis. I think in terms of long term, we're highly confident that we're outgrowing the underlying market by two to three percentage points. What exactly that was in one quarter versus the other is a little bit more difficult to ascertain, especially in the current environment. But on a full year basis, certainly, the way these plans are set up is for two to three percentage points of outgrowth on an annual basis. Yes. So Tami, our growth projection is based on the Q1 actual results that we are reporting today. And then we are projecting based on historical run rates into -- through the balance of the year. So there's really no assumption here, no economic forecasts or an underlying assumptions, things are going to get better in the back half or worse than the back half of the year. It's based on again revenue per day in Q1 and projected into -- through the balance of the year. No. I think the only pricing that is included in our guidance is what we know as of today. So we know, what price increases we have actioned and announced and so that is known. But any further increases beyond that would not be included in our guidance as we sit here today. Well, so I think in Q1 I think Europe was up 7%. I think we're seeing -- we saw some pressure. In -- if you look at the automotive numbers the sales numbers -- we saw a lot of strength on the food equipment side to offset that. I think and if you kind of look at the projection for the balance of the year, I think it adds up to somewhere in the low single-digit type growth rate in Europe. Just to maybe comment or put it down, I think so far through April, everything appears to be on track including Europe. Sure. Yes, I mean I think just to kind of dimensionalize it. China is about 8% of our revenues and I think we -- at this point, we've not seen -- we're obviously not immune to what's going on in China. But like I said so far through April, everything appears to be on track including in China. So ,everything that we know is baked in Joe. So and I think the -- it's fair to say that the inflationary pressures are real across all seven segments. They are a little more pronounced as you can see it in the margins in auto, maybe construction this quarter I mentioned that as well as Polymers & Fluids. I think there is a little bit of a -- we're still catching up to some extent. So, the 250 basis points of headwind will be better starting in Q2 based on what we know today somewhere closer to 200 and then from there in the back half if things stay the way they are like I said earlier we're starting to turn positive. And we're beginning -- I think the important point is we're beginning to recover the margin impact that we've had over the last four or five quarters now. So, I think once we get through this cycle like I said in the prepared remarks and when things do begin to normalize down the road from a supply chain and from a cost standpoint that is when the margin recovery begins. And so we're taking to some extent this is a -- we described it as a near-term pressure here in Q1 and over time we'll begin to recover those margins again. It's a combination of things. I think Jeff, if you go back to our last call the -- what was baked into our guidance at the time was half of the IHS growth build forecast of 9%. So we were basically at somewhere around 4% to 5% builds. And that's where IHS is today. So I think there's actually not a big change relative to where we were three months ago. And what we're basically based on various data inputs including from our customers, we thought the best way to update kind of forecast the auto business is to say that revenues stay where they are which is somewhere around $760 million in Q1 and that's what we've assumed for Q2, Q3 and Q4. So -- and then ultimately, I mean we still believe that down the road, when these supply chain issues get resolved and automotive production recovers, this segment is going to be very well set up as a strong contributor to the overall organic growth rate of the enterprise. But we just think it's going to take a little bit longer based on everything that we are seeing and hearing from our customers. So I think you tried this on the last call to get me to tell you a little bit more about price versus volume. So -- and just to reiterate, these are our best estimates. So I can't give you a lot of detail other than I can tell you that the -- there is volume leverage on the 1% revenue growth increase and that's really the 10% -- $0.10 a share that we're adding to our guidance, okay? So it is not -- from that you can infer, it's not all price. It's a combination of things. Sure. Andy. Yeah. I think the -- I heard your first part. What the second part was what did you say slowdown? Specialty. Yeah, I think specialty is really more of a timing issue related to some specific equipment projects in Europe and a few projects in China. So I think that's really more of a timing issue than anything else. I think if you just kind of take a step back I think you pointed out the right ones, in terms of a lot of strength in certainly Food Equipment, but also Welding. Test & Measurement there's some -- up against some difficult comps. Construction, there's certainly a lot of positive momentum, really across the board. And what does not come across and we've talked about this before, we're not a backlog-driven company. But in the segments that are more exposed to the capital equipment space, so that would include Test & Measurement, Welding, Food & Equipment, we are building significant backlog and really despite the fact that we are performing, like I said, at a high level relative to our competitors, we're building substantial backlog. That's not showing up, obviously, yet in our revenues. Well, I think as you know, I mean, there's still a lot of strength in the US housing market and that's where you saw these residential remodel numbers up 36%. And included in that is also some meaningful share gains, based on what we're seeing in portions of that business, where it's difficult to supply the market, we are taking advantage of our supply position to take share. The commercial side, 15%, that's a smaller part of the business. And then, really, on a geographic basis, it's not just North America, but it's also Europe, up 16%. For example, the UK up 20%; and then Australia and New Zealand still delivering a solid 10%. So it's pretty broad-based and again, we're modeling based on run rates. And so, we have not seen anything to suggest that the market is slowing down at this point. Sure. Good morning. Well, what does get better from here, if things stay the way they are, is price/cost as we talked about. And so, we're going from significant margin dilution here in Q1 of 250 basis points to maybe even slightly positive in the second half of the year. So that's -- and that's based on everything that we know today. And Nigel, it's not that we don't want to -- so the issue around price is that, it is an estimate at best. And it is not -- especially with -- in such a dynamic environment it would be very difficult to sit here and give you a number with a high degree of confidence and we've not done that historically. And like, I think, we talked about on the last call, we're not going to go down the path of breaking out price versus volume any further. So that's the best I can do here for you. Well, I think that's productivity. I'm not sure exactly how you get there. I mean I think there's 90 basis points of enterprise initiatives that's not on here. In the 26.1%. And so, is the -- any other productivity gains. There's a couple of things that are nodding here is there's some margin dilution from increased sales commissions. When you grow your revenues double-digit, your commissions are going to go up. But broadly speaking, what we try to do is give you a fairly accurate representation of these near-term pressures and therefore, what our core operating margins are running at, which is somewhere around 26%-plus in the current environment. And as we just talked about these price/cost pressures normalize, that's where we would expect margins to head as we continue on our path to our target of 28%-plus. Sure. Yeah. I think that's what I said. Yeah, I think that's a -- based again with the caveat that we are in a very dynamic uncertain environment. But to the extent that -- based on what we know today that is -- that would be correct. Yeah. I mean, I... Yeah. We don't agree with that one. Two, I'm not quite sure what you're -- what data you're looking at. So it's a little bit difficult for me to comment. All I can do is report the actual results for our Food Equipment business, for example. And I think we give you a fair bit of detail including by end market. And beyond that I can't really -- like I said before, we don't report price versus volume and so I'm not sure I can help you. Well, so, I think let me just start by saying that our customer relationships are strategic long-term relationships. We're not trying to maximize price. We're trying to serve our customers and make sure that we get paid for offering a really differentiated product service or solution. So we've always had pricing power in these businesses. I think ultimately, these are going to be discussions with customers when costs start to normalize and there might be a few exceptions, but by and large, we expect to hold on to these price increases to recover the margins like I said earlier. So that's typically what happens. If you go back and look in time, we're going to end up with a period where we recover that margin percentage and we don't expect the current cycle to be any different. Sure. Yeah. So let me address that. I mean, I think, we're still in that 46% to 47% in the first half and the balance in the second half. And the big driver really is, what we've talked about it feels like for a while here is price/cost beginning to turn positive, based again on the assumptions that we're making in our guidance. So that's the drive. Now historically, we do 49%, 51%. So it's a couple of percentage points. So, but it is a little bit more back-end loaded. We expect that as we go through the year, sequentially starting in Q2 margins will improve and so will revenues. And that's just based again on kind of historical run rates. And so we expect a steady kind of improvement in Q2, Q3 and in Q4 including on the margin side. Whether it's exactly the number you laid out, I can't really comment. But directionally that's \u2013 that is the right way to look at it. Well, so I think if you look at our inventory levels, we were running at about three months on hand. Our historical is two months. And so we have an extra month of inventory on hand. And I think we've been very clear about why that is. It's to mitigate supply chain risk, it's to take care of our customers and ultimately to win this recovery and take share at a point where our competitors are maybe not able to service our customers. So that's the vast majority of these inventory increases, just kind of maybe a little housekeeping. If you look at our conversion rate here in Q1 the difference between the 38% and the 80% to 85% is about $300 million of working capital very intentional investments. We believe a really smart use of our balance sheet. And you saw the top line growth, right at 11% organic this quarter. That I would argue would not have happened if we've not taken this approach starting really last year to make a conscious decision to invest in inventory. And then, obviously, receivables will go up as you grow double-digit. Ultimately, we don't see any reason why structurally when supply chain begins to normalize both from an availability standpoint and also from a cost standpoint that we will go back to two months on hand. And at that point if that happens you'll see these free cash flow numbers will deliver above-average performance, until we're back to kind of normal levels. So we view this really as a temporary increase in working capital.  How quickly that will come down, depends on a lot of things, including what you're talking about and -- which is inventory in the channel where we really don't have a lot of visibility. Other than I can tell you, for the most part the channel does not carry a lot of inventory because they're used to the fact that we will take care of them when they need products. So there's no incentive for them to carry a lot of extra inventory. So, that's probably the best I can give you Julian."

            "content": "Thanks Karen, and good morning, everyone. We have talked often about the fact that the core focus of our enterprise strategy is to leverage the performance power of the ITW business model to consistently deliver top-tier performance in any environment. And our teams around the world continue to do an exceptional job of doing just that as evidenced by the 11% organic growth and 23% operating margins that they delivered in Q1. In the quarter we saw continued strong demand almost across the board while input cost inflation and supply chain issues remain challenging to say the least and our business has responded. Across the company, we continue to leverage the advantaged supply capabilities inherent in our 80/20 front-to-back operating system to support our customers and execute our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio. Many of our businesses continued to receive strong feedback from their customers that their current delivery performance is truly differentiated and that they are being awarded additional share as a result. And despite another step-up in input cost inflation in Q1, we more than offset cost increases on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the quarter. Looking ahead at the remainder of 2022 based on our first quarter results and projecting current demand, supply rates and all-known cost increases through the balance of the year, we are raising our guidance for full year 2022 organic growth to 8.5% at the midpoint and GAAP EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint, which is 14% earnings growth year-over-year and would be an all-time record for the company. While the near-term environment certainly has its challenges, we remain focused on delivering differentiated service to our customers, differentiated financial performance for our shareholders and continued progress on our path to ITW's full potential. Now I'll turn the call over to Michael, who'll provide more detail on the quarter and our full year outlook. Michael? Good morning. You're welcome. I'd say at this point, that would be really tough, just given all that's going on. Sure. Thank you. Sure. Good morning Joe. That's embedded in the 26.1%. We wouldn't share that view."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's fourth quarter 2023 conference call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. Also with us today is Erin Linnihan who joined our Investor Relations team last month as Vice President. Erin, welcome to ITW. During today's call, we'll discuss ITW's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide guidance for full-year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, we delivered a solid finish to a year of high quality execution and face some pretty unique challenges, including slowing demand for CapEx, headwinds from customer and channel inventory reductions and an automotive industry strike. As a result, organic growth was essentially flat in the fourth quarter. Operating margin came in at 24.8% with 150 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives and free cash flow grew almost 40%. GAAP EPS of $2.38 included $0.04 of unfavorable impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. Throughout 2023, the ITW team continued to leverage the strength and resilience of the business model and our high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver a year of strong operational and financial performance, including solid organic growth of 2% on top of 12% growth in both 2021 and 2022. Operating margin of 25.1% and an improvement year-over-year of 130 basis points. Income growth of 7% to a record $4 billion, after-tax ROIC of more than 30%, 50% plus free cash flow growth and GAAP EPS of $9.74. We delivered these results while investing almost $800 million to sustain productivity and accelerate our organic growth initiatives in our highly profitable core businesses. As we outlined at our Investor Day, our key strategic priority as we enter this next phase of our enterprise strategy in 2024 is to build above market organic growth fueled by customer-back innovation into defining ITW strength on par with our world class financial and operational capabilities. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of demand across the majority of our portfolio, along with some meaningful improvements in both customer and channel partner inventory levels and input cost inflation, as well as continued progress on customer-back innovation.  For our usual process, our organic growth projection for 2024 of 1% to 3%, and our EPS guidance of $10.20 at the midpoint, reflect current levels of demand adjusted for seasonality. Operating margin is projected to improve by about a 100 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. This includes another solid contribution of approximately a 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and full-year performance as well as our guidance for 2024, I want to thank my ITW colleagues around the world. Their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence and for their incredible support as I transition into the CEO role. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, the ITW team delivered a solid finish operationally and financially to a strong year for the company. Starting with the topline, the soft market demand for CapEx that we talked about on our Q3 earnings call continued into the fourth quarter. In addition, customer and channel inventory reductions and the automotive industry strike reduced our organic growth rate by approximately 1.5%, resulting in essentially Fed revenue and organic growth on a year-over-year basis. That said, we finished the year with stable to slightly improving demand on a sales per day basis, as evidenced by sequential revenue growth of plus 2.5% from Q3 into Q4 compared to our historical sequential growth of plus 1.5%. Foreign currency translation added 1.2% to revenue and divestitures reduced revenue by 0.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.38 and included $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. On the bottom line, operating income was a Q4 record of $988 million and operating margin was flat year-over-year as enterprise initiatives of 150 basis points and 60 basis points of price, cost, margin benefit, net of year-over-year inventory revaluations were offset by a combination of growth investments including headcount ads, higher employee-related costs, such as wages and benefits, as well as increased restructuring expenses year-over-year. Free cash flow grew 39% to a fourth quarter record of 908 million with a conversion to net income of 127%. Overall for Q4, solid operational execution and financial performance in a pretty challenging environment. Please turn to Slide 4, starting with one of the highlights for Q4 and the year. Our free cash flow performance on the left side of the page. And as you can see, our full-year free cash flow was up more than a $1 billion to a record $3.1 billion as our inventory months on hand metric continued its slide path to pre-COVID levels. Now let's move to the segment results starting with automotive OEM, which led the way with organic growth of 8%, despite North America being down 9% due to the impact of the automotive strike. Meanwhile, Europe's organic growth rate was plus 11%, and China was up 31% driven by strong market share and penetration gains in the rapidly growing EV market. Operating margin was 19.2% excluding 160 basis points of headwind from higher 80/20 front-to-back restructuring expenses as the automotive OEM team continues to work toward its margin goal in the low to mid-20s over the next two to three years as outlined at our Investor Day. Looking forward, we expect automotive OEM to grow 3% to 5% in 2024, based on an assumption of essentially flat global auto bills year-over-year, plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued above market organic growth in China. Turn to Slide 5. Food equipment delivered organic growth of 3% against a tough comparison of plus 17% in Q4 last year. Equipment grew 1% and service was very strong, up 7% for the quarter. By region, North America grew 4% with institutional end markets up in the mid-teens, retail up mid-single digits and restaurants down in the high-single digits. Europe and Asia Pacific both grew 1%. Test and measurement and electronics, organic revenue was down 1% due to continued softness in semiconductor-related end markets. While test and measurement grew 5%, electronics declined 14%. Moving on to Slide 6. Slower demand in welding resulted in an organic revenue decline of 7%. Equipment was down 8% and consumables were down 6%. Industrial sales declined 11% versus a tough comparison of plus 23%. Commercial was down 2% and oil and gas was down 3%. Overall, North America was down 7% and international was down 6%. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue declined 2% with our automotive aftermarket down 3%, Polymers grew 6% and Fluids was down 7%. Operating margin expanded 270 basis points to an all-time high of 28.5% for the segment. Turning to Slide 7. In a tough housing market, construction products, organic revenue declined 4% as North America was essentially flat with residential renovation flat and commercial construction up 3%. International markets have been soft all year and in the fourth quarter, Europe was down 9% and Australia, New Zealand was down 5%. Specialty products, organic revenue was down 5% as North America was down 6% and international declined 5%. Consumables were down 10% and equipment revenue grew 8%. Moving to Slide 8 and full-year 2023 results. And as Chris said, throughout the year, our colleagues around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers and responding decisively to a challenging and volatile market demand environment. As a result of their efforts, ITW delivered record financial performance in 2023 with solid organic growth of 2% on top of 12% growth in both 2021 and 2022. Best-in-class margins of more than 25% and after-tax return on invested capital of more than 30%. And we delivered these results while continuing to fully fund projects to accelerate above market organic growth and sustain productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. We raised our dividend 7% and return more than $3 billion of shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let's move to Slide 9 and our guidance for full-year 2024. And looking ahead, we definitely see some positives in terms of moderating headwinds in the external environment from supply chain, input cost inflation, and customer channel partner inventory reductions. But there are certainly some challenges, including lower automotive bills that I talked about earlier for example. For our usual process, our topline guidance of revenue growth of 2% to 4%, an organic growth of 1% to 3% is based on current levels of demand adjusted for typical seasonality and incorporate current foreign exchange rates. Operating margin is expected to improve by about a 100 basis points to a range of 25.5% to 26.5%, which includes a 100 basis points contribution from our enterprise initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital is expected to remain firmly at 30% plus, and we expect strong free cash flows again with conversion greater than net income. For 2024, we are projecting GAAP EPS in the range of $10 to $10.40, which includes headwinds of about $0.10 of higher interest expense and $0.20 of higher income tax expense with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In terms of cadence for the year, we expect our typical first half, second half EPS split of 49% and 51%. Our capital allocation plans for 2024 are consistent with our longstanding disciplined capital allocation framework that we discussed at last year's Investor Day. Our top priority remains internal investments to support the organic growth initiatives associated with the next phase of the enterprise strategy and sustained productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. Second priority is an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, which remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high quality acquisitions that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement opportunity from the application of our proprietary and powerful 80/20 front to back methodology and can generate acceptable risk adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital. And finally, ITW's surplus capital is allocated to an active share repurchase program as we plan to buy back $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2024.  Turn to our last slide, Slide 10 for our 2024 organic growth projections by segment. And as you can see, five of seven segments combined are projecting organic growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint, partially offset by some unique challenges in construction and specialty products. These segment projections are the outcome of the bottom up planning process that we completed in January, and a combination of several factors including current levels of demand, deep underground market and customer insights from our divisions, market share gain expectations, and the growing contribution from our customer-back innovation efforts and the associated new product launches in every one of our divisions. Consistent with ITWs continuous improvement, never satisfied mindset, every segment is projecting to improve their operating margin performance again in 2024 with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives across the Board. So overall, we are heading into the first year of our next phase enterprise strategy, well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge as we move through 2024. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Michael. Eric, can you please open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hello. Good morning. Thank you so much. So my first question is, when we look at the annual guide, organic growth guide for 2024 for each segment, how should we think about these segment growth rates for the first quarter? Should it be similar to the annual guide, or do you expect any deviation from that in the first quarter and then maybe improvement throughout the year?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think, you'll see improvement in the year-over-year organic growth rates as the comparisons get easier as we move through the year. But by and large, the projections here track kind of typical seasonality from Q4 into Q1 and so forth. So there's really nothing unusual there. The other thing to keep in mind is while the guidance at the enterprise level is essentially based on current run rates as we talked about. It's a much more granular projection at the segment level, which includes also significant contribution again from new products as well as our normal pricing less drag from the inventory reduction that we've been talking about really all year. And so really give a better kind of number as we look at the segments. So that's how I would think about it.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. And then it seems like the inside incremental margin for the year is in the 60% to 70% range, probably in the high 60 if my math is right versus normally 35% to 40%. So what's really driving this? Any specific segment you want to call up that may drive this overall high incremental for the year?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think Tami, we've got fairly modest kind of revenue growth that we're calling for here, 1% to 3%. And our incremental margins embedded in the guidance are higher than our typical long-term 35% to 40%, which is what I would still use in terms of long-term modeling. The reason why is a 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives that give us a higher incremental margin in 2024. As part of our planning process that I just described, we've now had a chance to go through all the projects and activities that contribute to a 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives, again in 2024. And I might add, these are largely independent of volume. So regardless of what volume does, we're seeing another significant contribution here, which is certainly a nice thing to have in your hip pocket in what we would describe still as a fairly uncertain and volatile environment.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you so much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann: Great. Good morning, everybody. I actually wanted to ask \u2013 excuse me \u2013 I wanted to ask the margin question a little bit differently, Michael, because if you have a 100 basis points from enterprise, and that's kind of the total that we're looking for, I suppose there must be some offsets in maybe some other costs or something because we're not really getting underlying incrementals. We're sort of getting it all from the enterprise initiatives, if you follow me. So just any detail on that would be great.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So I think the math is actually pretty simple for 2024. So we've got some volume leverage at that 2% to 4% revenue growth, maybe just round numbers, maybe that's about 50 basis points. The enterprise initiatives add about a 100 basis points. We're entering into what we would describe as a normal price cost environment at this point. And so there's like a modest positive contribution from our price cost efforts. And then the offset is really our continued investments in growth, including some headcount, some employee-related cost, wages and benefits, even though those costs are moderating in 2023 that's still is approximately a 100 basis points of headwind, which then gets us to that midpoint of 26% in 2024. And I might add, well, on our way to our 30% target here by 2030 that we talked about at Investor Day.\nStephen Volkmann: Super. Okay. Thanks for filling that in. And then maybe if I could just follow-up, the food guide, the bottoms up food sort of outlook of 3% to 5% seems like a bit of an acceleration from sort of recent trends, and we don't have super easy comps, I don't think. So what are you seeing in that end market?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. Sure, Steve. So on Food Equipment, projecting 3% to 5% growth next year, really on the back of a few different aspects. Firstly, as always, with Food Equipment, it's a very fertile environment for innovation. So we see several new product launches across all product categories. We would expect less channel destocking Food Equipment in 2024. And also I would say we have a continued recovery in service. As I think, service is about one-third of our revenues in food. We're the only major manufacturer with that captive service business and service is a business that's still in recovery pretty much from COVID, equipment has recovered, but we will see probably the final year of recovery in service in 2024, and all that is adding up to a 3% to 5% growth rate in food next year.\nStephen Volkmann: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Michael, when we look at your 1% to 3% organic growth forecast for 2024, you have a nice acceleration dialed into for your CapEx businesses such as welding and T&M. You're saying you're basing your guidance and current run rates. So you obviously did mention some improvement in sequential demand in Q4. Could you give us more color on what you're seeing in these CapEx businesses that's allowing you to forecast what you're forecasting? I would imagine you're dialing an improvements in semicon and electronics, for instance, in T&M, but that goes into now what you usually do. I'm just curious as to what's flushing out.\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think, like we've said, really most of the year we've seen some slowing in demand for CapEx and certainly in Q3 and Q4. I think as we go into 2024, as Chris just said, we've got less headwind from these customer and channel partner inventory reductions that were drag of about 1% in 2023. We have a meaningful contribution and increased contribution from new products, given all the efforts around customer-back innovation that we're driving. And then we have normal pricing, and you put all of that together and just based on, I think as you point out, it was encouraging that we saw a pickup in the sequential revenue per day from Q3 to Q4, that I think tells you that there's certainly some stability here and some of the headwinds I just described are maybe mostly behind us. We expect still a little bit of headwind from these inventory reductions as we go through the first half of the year. I think of it \u2013 we're working through our own inventory levels here and we expect to reduce our inventories in the first half. We think our customers and channel partners maybe doing some of the same, but it'll be less of a headwind here in 2024. So you put all of that together, I think you're an environment where things are pretty stable. Test and measurement you mentioned semi, it's less than 3% of our revenues. There is an expectation of a modest market pickup here in the second half. We expect to gain share and launch new products in this space. So we'll grow a little bit faster than market there. But overall, we're not expecting a big recovery in demand or the economy to pick up in the second half. This is basically based on kind of current run rates. The one outlier I'll just reiterate is automotive, we're going from a build environment in 2023, that was up in the high-single digits. We expect that to be about flat. And so the growth in automotive is all from penetration gains and continued market share and innovation in China which has been an incredible contributor to our overall growth rate and will remain so for the foreseeable future.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful color, Michael. And then Chris or Michael, you mentioned unique challenges in specialty equipment and construction products. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing in these segments. Doing more PLS in specialty, for example, what's the outlook or frame the outlook for 2024?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. That's correct, Andy. In terms of specialty particularly, we're doing some strategic portfolio work there heavier, I would say amount of product line pruning than we normally expect in a normal maintenance environment. We're doing quite a bit more on specialty really to position that segment for long-term growth of 4% plus. So that's what's going on there, and we're pretty pleased with the progress around that. On construction, it is very much a market story. I mean, obviously, all three main markets for us, North America, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand are all forecasting significantly declines in housing bills next year, that will be 11% in North America, mid-single digits in Europe and high-single digits in A and Z. So that's really what's impacting the construction business.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Helpful, guys. Thank you.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoseph O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning. Yes.\nJoseph O'Dea: So I mean, you talked about the daily sales rate from Q3 to Q4. It sounds like overall customer tone is perhaps getting a little bit better. You're talking about adding some headcount. Can you just expand a little bit on customer conversations over the last several months to understand a little bit better sort of the verticals where you see some of that uptick happening, and then where you are adding headcount within the business?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, I think the tone from customers has been pretty cautious all year, particularly on the CapEx side of things as we talked about. If you go back to our Investor Day last year, we talked a lot about accelerating our efforts to drive high quality above market organic growth primarily fueled by, as Chris said earlier, our customer-back innovation efforts. And so those are the areas, all growth related headcount ads that we're making to make sure that we have all the capability we need in terms of innovation, commercial, sales and marketing resources to drive continued progress and deliver on our above market organic growth commitments.\nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. And then on the channel inventory side of things, can you just talk about the visibility that you have and any context on how maybe elevated those inventory levels got during supply chain constraints? Where you think they are now relative to normal? It sounds like you think first half of this year you could still see customers doing a little bit of work to trim inventories.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think by and large, if you go back historically, we haven't had great visibility to the levels of inventory in the channel and with our customers. I think we have much better visibility today, given that we've been talking about it all year. Overall, it's been a drag of a percentage point on our growth rate for the year. It was 1.5% in Q3, 1% in Q4, and I think several of our segments, we are back to kind of normal inventory levels and this is largely behind us. And then there's maybe a few other areas where there might be some continued, but certainly less headwind as we go into Q1 and Q2. And then I think at that point, we'll give you an update. I think we'll be able to say this is now completely behind us.\nJoseph O'Dea: And so with respect to the growth outlook that there's no real inventory \u2013 notable inventory headwind within that growth range?\nMichael Larsen: Well, there's a little bit. I mean, obviously if you look at our run rates, it is included in our run rates at a higher level than what we might reasonably expect. So if that plays out the way we expect, that would be certainly favorable to the run rate and to the guidance that we just gave you.\nJoseph O'Dea: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nSabrina: Hey, good morning. You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin.\nMichael Larsen: Hey, Sabrina.\nSabrina: As we think about pricing into 2024, are there any segments or any particular businesses where on the margin you're seeing more competition and pricing competition as cost moderate?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think, Sabrina, we've talked about this before, we want to maintain our price premium based on the quality and the customer service, the lead times that ITW is uniquely positioned to provide, but we also want to compete and we want to gain market share. That's kind of central to our overall enterprise strategy and the focus I just talked about around organic growth. So that's said, I think we expect a normal contribution from price here in 2024. These inflation-driven price increases are now behind us. Input cost inflation, that big wave we've been dealing with, as we sit here today, we'd say is largely behind us. And so we're entering into a normal pricing environment across the portfolio. I think that is a fair statement. If you just look at, we've now essentially recovered the margin impact from that price costs, the price cost dynamics, and we're entering into a normal environment in 2024.\nSabrina: Thanks. And then as a follow-up on welding, what is driving the reacceleration in growth there from down 6% in 4Q? And how are you thinking about margins in the segment in 2024 given where you're exiting the year and the sort of margins you reported in 2023 here?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Well, I think welding, so we're not counting on a market acceleration, just to be clear. This is if you look at in a normal market environment, just assume for a minute, let's assume the market is flat. The contribution from new products and normal price very quickly gets you to something in the low-single digits. So I just want to be clear around that. The other thing I'd say, just on the margins. We talked a little about the year-over-year inventory revaluations. That's what caused the margins to drop in the fourth quarter, below 30%. And we expect that to be back above 30% here in the first quarter as that one-time kind of year-over-year inventory impact is behind us. So we would expect margins to kind of remain in that 30% plus as we go through 2024. And as I said earlier, that's not unusual. Every one of our segments told us as part of this bottom up planning process that they are on target to improve their operating margin performance in 2024.\nSabrina: Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Well, thanks. Good morning.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nSteven Fisher: This has been asked in a few ways about the segments, but really just trying to think about the 1% to 3% organic growth in the context of your sort of 4% to 7% CAGR through 2030. I guess what's the buildup of market growth and price versus market penetration and customer-back innovation? I know again, there's lots of different segment dynamics here, but when you roll it all up, are you basically assuming that it is kind of like flat markets and a couple of points of penetration and innovation. Is that the way to think about it?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. I think it is. I mean, as we say, in our four to seven calculus that we outlined at our Investor Day, you have a contribution from market \u2013 contribution from market penetration, and the largest contribution is actually from customer-back innovation. And that's what we're seeing here in 2024 really across most of our businesses. As we used to think about growth, 2% growth last year on top of 2021 \u2013 or 12% growth in 2021 and 2022 and targeting 1% to 3% here on the path to four plus, is kind of how are outlining this. And I would say that it's a target and a goal that we're very confident on the basis that it's where the bulk of our divisions are spending their time. We're making progress, certainly more to do, but given the portfolio, given the fact that we've got plenty of room to grow in each segment, given the investments that Michael has been talking about that we've been making now for quite a few years in strategic marketing and innovation. We're really putting ourselves and building the muscle here to get into a position where we will grow 4% plus over the entirety of this next phase. And I think in terms of just capability build, if you think about this in the way that \u2013 the way we leaned into front to back 80/20 in the last phase of our strategy, that's the way we're leaning into innovation in the next phase of our strategy. The same level of rigor, scope, and capability building that we applied to front to back 80/20 in the first phase. We are now applying to customer-back innovation here in this next phase. And I would say we're very encouraged by the progress that we've seen on innovation over the last couple of years. It was a 1% contributor five years ago. It's now a 2% contributor on its way to 3% and beyond. And again, very encouraged by the progress that we're seeing across many of our divisions in terms of the qualitative work they're doing on innovation, but also in terms of the quality of the innovation pipeline across all seven segments.\nSteven Fisher: That's really helpful. And just to follow-up, sort of the macro level of the pace of economic growth seems to be diverging between Europe and North America increasingly. So can you just give us a sense of what you've factored in on the European economy and how you're thinking about that? I know you talked about the construction side, and I guess similarly on China, how are you thinking about China in 2024 sort of a net positive for you, I think in 2023, maybe different for some other companies. So how are you thinking about that in 2024?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. I think in our overall guidance here of 1% to 3% organic, that's where you'll find all the major geographies. So North America, in that low single-digit, 1% to 3% range. And Europe kind of similar to North America, definitely we've seen some challenges on the construction side as you pointed out, but kind of you put it all together, it's in that one to three range. And then the China is more positive, but that's really driven by the automotive business, which is more than half of our revenues in China. So we expect another double-digit type growth for the auto business in China. And that takes China to kind of the mid single-digit range in 2024.\nSteven Fisher: Really helpful. Thank you so much. \nChristopher O'Herlihy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much and good morning.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe \u2013 and apologies if I'm somewhat retreading some worn ground already, but just trying to understand on the revenue outlook again, because it sounds like you had suffered from some destocking in 2023. You're assuming that destocking continues Q1 and Q2 or you're seeing that destocking continue as we speak. But you sound confident on the sort of sell-through, I suppose and so the guidance embeds your selling recouples upwards to sell through in the second half. So I just wanted to make sure, is that the right way of thinking about it? And when you're thinking about sell-through right now, is your sense from your salespeople and the bottom up work that you mentioned that the sell-through in most of your markets is sort of better now than a few months ago. Just trying to understand that, please?\nMichael Larsen: I'd say it's about the same, Julian. I mean, I think we \u2013 as Chris said, we just delivered 2% organic growth in 2023 in a pretty challenging environment as we talked about. And that included a point of inventory reduction impact. And I might add a point of drag from semi since it came up earlier. So if those two don't repeat, which is what we're saying, then you go from 2% to 4% pretty quickly. And we're not saying that destocking continues at the same level in the first half, which I think is what you said. We do expect it to be less of a drag in the first half. We also said the comps year-over-year are certainly more challenging in the first half than they are in the second half. So I think we're confident because when we look at everything going on inside the company and this focus on driving above market organic growth, a big focus on customer-back innovation, we look at the pipeline and new products that are being launched in every one of our divisions across the company. We look at a kind of a normal pricing environment. We feel pretty confident based on what we're seeing, as we sit here today. Now, we also said this is a pretty uncertain and volatile environment, things can change quickly. And so the thing that we have a lot of confidence is our ability to continue to read and react to whatever conditions our divisions are dealing with on the ground and deliver strong performance as we go through 2024. So we're not economists. We're not trying to forecast where the global economy is going. We're kind of basing our guidance on all the things we just talked about. And that's how we end up in that 1% to 3% range for 2024, which to us doesn't seem like a moonshot based on everything we just talked about.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching away from the topline. On the margin front, I think in an earlier question reply, you mentioned sort of higher investments offsetting enterprise initiatives. So there's a couple of things on margin. One was, are we seeing a big increase in R&D and/or CapEx this year and any color on those as a sort of external benchmark for that reinvestment rate? And then price cost, I think a big first half tailwind for you maybe on margins this year. Just wanted to sort of any sense of scale for that.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. Price cost, I think we're kind of in a normal environment for 2024. It's not going to be a material driver of our performance. It'll be a modest contribution to margins and EPS in 2024 based on everything that we know today from a pricing and inflation standpoint. In terms of the investments, I think, our investments grow in line with our sales over time, and that's true both for customer-back innovation, it's also true for our capacity CapEx improvements that \u2013 that are all of these investments, about $800 million in 2024 are geared and centered around driving above market organic growth in every one of our divisions. And the biggest headwind, I think to margins this year was not so much the investments necessarily not just in growth, but we saw inflation in our employee-related costs just like everybody else including wages and benefits. And we expect that part of the equation to moderate here in 2024 based on some of the actions we're taking to manage those costs in 2024. So that's not going to be an increased headwind as we go forward.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.\nMircea Dobre: Thank you for taking our question. Good morning.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning, Mig.\nMircea Dobre: On the topic of outgrowth, it sounds like you're seeing about 2% this year. You're aiming for maybe 3 percentage points. I guess what I'm curious, when you're looking at your portfolio, presumably we don't have this outgrowth notion being sort of evenly distributed, what portions of your portfolio are generating outgrowth at the pace that you need it to be? And where else do we need to see further investment or further adjustments needed to be made?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So Mig, I would say that, we're probably seeing our growth across most of our portfolio. I would use, auto as an example, think about flat bills in 2024. We're talking about 3% to 5% on auto as an example. We've historically outgrown in food equipment. As I think, if you look at some of the comparisons and so on. Also with welding and with construction, large down market here in 2023 which we outgrew, so we have the capacity to outgrow across much of our segment. And with respect to investments, I think we've been making these focused targeted investments for some time now. This is not new news. This is something we've been doing for a few years to really position ourselves to grow at 4% plus across the enterprise over this next phase. And I think the big driver of that, as we said a few times is customer-back innovation, is leaning on customer-back innovation that we've been working on for a couple of years, and we'll accelerate over this next phase. And that's really what will drive the outgrowth going forward. And that customer-back innovation opportunity resides in every segment on the basis of the level of differentiation in every segment, the share runway opportunity we have in every segment. So we would expect every segment in time to meaningfully contribute to that 4% plus organic growth.\nMichael Larsen: I would just add to that, Mig. We've talked a lot about the individual segments today. I think you got to look at ITW as the beneficiary of a highly diversified, high quality portfolio. All of our segments with margins in the high-20s, we're working through automotive, and so you're always going to have some puts and takes, which is what we're talking about. But this portfolio really gives us a level of resilience and a real competitive advantage relative to others, and puts us in a great position to perform, continue to perform at a high level in any type of demand environment over the long-term. Now, we never said that we were going to be the fastest grower. There's always going to be certain end market trends, whether it be aerospace or electrification or whatever it maybe. But you put this portfolio together in its totality. We have all the firepower that we need to deliver a 4% plus average annual organic growth as we go forward. And by the way, five of our segments are doing that, as we said earlier in 2024. So I wouldn't lose sight of the fact that, we're a business model centric company and a huge beneficiary of this high quality diversified portfolio.\nMircea Dobre: Understood. Then my follow-up, maybe a question on M&A, Chris, love to get your thoughts on this and maybe how you think about using M&A as a potential tool to generate this outgrowth that you're talking about? Thank you.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. Sure, Mig. So effectively, we are very much sticking to our disciplined portfolio management strategy, which is very consistent in terms of \u2013 we are certainly interested in high quality acquisitions where we can find them that extend our long-term growth potential to grow at a minimum 4% plus at high quality. That's the primary kind of lens, we look at acquisitions. We've been able to leverage the business model to improve margins. And so we certainly review opportunities on an ongoing basis, but we're pretty selective here about acquisitions, given the fact that we believe we've got a lot of organic growth potential that we're going to execute on here over the next few years. If I think about MTS as an example of the typical \u2013 attractive candidate, we look at and ticked all the boxes in terms of strategic attraction, in terms of differentiation, solving customer pain points, opportunity to leverage the business model to improve margins. And having owned that business now for just over two years because we stuck to the characteristics that we believe in with respect to acquisitions. This is an acquisition that's turning on to be a home run and will be a great ITW business in the long-term. So it's a real blueprint for how we think about acquisitions and how we'd be thinking about acquisitions going forward.\nMircea Dobre: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, the ITW team delivered a solid finish operationally and financially to a strong year for the company. Starting with the topline, the soft market demand for CapEx that we talked about on our Q3 earnings call continued into the fourth quarter. In addition, customer and channel inventory reductions and the automotive industry strike reduced our organic growth rate by approximately 1.5%, resulting in essentially Fed revenue and organic growth on a year-over-year basis. That said, we finished the year with stable to slightly improving demand on a sales per day basis, as evidenced by sequential revenue growth of plus 2.5% from Q3 into Q4 compared to our historical sequential growth of plus 1.5%. Foreign currency translation added 1.2% to revenue and divestitures reduced revenue by 0.4%. GAAP EPS was $2.38 and included $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. On the bottom line, operating income was a Q4 record of $988 million and operating margin was flat year-over-year as enterprise initiatives of 150 basis points and 60 basis points of price, cost, margin benefit, net of year-over-year inventory revaluations were offset by a combination of growth investments including headcount ads, higher employee-related costs, such as wages and benefits, as well as increased restructuring expenses year-over-year. Free cash flow grew 39% to a fourth quarter record of 908 million with a conversion to net income of 127%. Overall for Q4, solid operational execution and financial performance in a pretty challenging environment. Please turn to Slide 4, starting with one of the highlights for Q4 and the year. Our free cash flow performance on the left side of the page. And as you can see, our full-year free cash flow was up more than a $1 billion to a record $3.1 billion as our inventory months on hand metric continued its slide path to pre-COVID levels. Now let's move to the segment results starting with automotive OEM, which led the way with organic growth of 8%, despite North America being down 9% due to the impact of the automotive strike. Meanwhile, Europe's organic growth rate was plus 11%, and China was up 31% driven by strong market share and penetration gains in the rapidly growing EV market. Operating margin was 19.2% excluding 160 basis points of headwind from higher 80/20 front-to-back restructuring expenses as the automotive OEM team continues to work toward its margin goal in the low to mid-20s over the next two to three years as outlined at our Investor Day. Looking forward, we expect automotive OEM to grow 3% to 5% in 2024, based on an assumption of essentially flat global auto bills year-over-year, plus our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued above market organic growth in China. Turn to Slide 5. Food equipment delivered organic growth of 3% against a tough comparison of plus 17% in Q4 last year. Equipment grew 1% and service was very strong, up 7% for the quarter. By region, North America grew 4% with institutional end markets up in the mid-teens, retail up mid-single digits and restaurants down in the high-single digits. Europe and Asia Pacific both grew 1%. Test and measurement and electronics, organic revenue was down 1% due to continued softness in semiconductor-related end markets. While test and measurement grew 5%, electronics declined 14%. Moving on to Slide 6. Slower demand in welding resulted in an organic revenue decline of 7%. Equipment was down 8% and consumables were down 6%. Industrial sales declined 11% versus a tough comparison of plus 23%. Commercial was down 2% and oil and gas was down 3%. Overall, North America was down 7% and international was down 6%. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue declined 2% with our automotive aftermarket down 3%, Polymers grew 6% and Fluids was down 7%. Operating margin expanded 270 basis points to an all-time high of 28.5% for the segment. Turning to Slide 7. In a tough housing market, construction products, organic revenue declined 4% as North America was essentially flat with residential renovation flat and commercial construction up 3%. International markets have been soft all year and in the fourth quarter, Europe was down 9% and Australia, New Zealand was down 5%. Specialty products, organic revenue was down 5% as North America was down 6% and international declined 5%. Consumables were down 10% and equipment revenue grew 8%. Moving to Slide 8 and full-year 2023 results. And as Chris said, throughout the year, our colleagues around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers and responding decisively to a challenging and volatile market demand environment. As a result of their efforts, ITW delivered record financial performance in 2023 with solid organic growth of 2% on top of 12% growth in both 2021 and 2022. Best-in-class margins of more than 25% and after-tax return on invested capital of more than 30%. And we delivered these results while continuing to fully fund projects to accelerate above market organic growth and sustain productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. We raised our dividend 7% and return more than $3 billion of shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let's move to Slide 9 and our guidance for full-year 2024. And looking ahead, we definitely see some positives in terms of moderating headwinds in the external environment from supply chain, input cost inflation, and customer channel partner inventory reductions. But there are certainly some challenges, including lower automotive bills that I talked about earlier for example. For our usual process, our topline guidance of revenue growth of 2% to 4%, an organic growth of 1% to 3% is based on current levels of demand adjusted for typical seasonality and incorporate current foreign exchange rates. Operating margin is expected to improve by about a 100 basis points to a range of 25.5% to 26.5%, which includes a 100 basis points contribution from our enterprise initiatives. After-tax return on invested capital is expected to remain firmly at 30% plus, and we expect strong free cash flows again with conversion greater than net income. For 2024, we are projecting GAAP EPS in the range of $10 to $10.40, which includes headwinds of about $0.10 of higher interest expense and $0.20 of higher income tax expense with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. In terms of cadence for the year, we expect our typical first half, second half EPS split of 49% and 51%. Our capital allocation plans for 2024 are consistent with our longstanding disciplined capital allocation framework that we discussed at last year's Investor Day. Our top priority remains internal investments to support the organic growth initiatives associated with the next phase of the enterprise strategy and sustained productivity in our highly profitable core businesses. Second priority is an attractive dividend that grows in line with earnings over time, which remains a critical component of ITW's total shareholder return model. Third, selective high quality acquisitions that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement opportunity from the application of our proprietary and powerful 80/20 front to back methodology and can generate acceptable risk adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital. And finally, ITW's surplus capital is allocated to an active share repurchase program as we plan to buy back $1.5 billion of our own shares in 2024.  Turn to our last slide, Slide 10 for our 2024 organic growth projections by segment. And as you can see, five of seven segments combined are projecting organic growth of approximately 4% at the midpoint, partially offset by some unique challenges in construction and specialty products. These segment projections are the outcome of the bottom up planning process that we completed in January, and a combination of several factors including current levels of demand, deep underground market and customer insights from our divisions, market share gain expectations, and the growing contribution from our customer-back innovation efforts and the associated new product launches in every one of our divisions. Consistent with ITWs continuous improvement, never satisfied mindset, every segment is projecting to improve their operating margin performance again in 2024 with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives across the Board. So overall, we are heading into the first year of our next phase enterprise strategy, well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge as we move through 2024. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Well, I think, you'll see improvement in the year-over-year organic growth rates as the comparisons get easier as we move through the year. But by and large, the projections here track kind of typical seasonality from Q4 into Q1 and so forth. So there's really nothing unusual there. The other thing to keep in mind is while the guidance at the enterprise level is essentially based on current run rates as we talked about. It's a much more granular projection at the segment level, which includes also significant contribution again from new products as well as our normal pricing less drag from the inventory reduction that we've been talking about really all year. And so really give a better kind of number as we look at the segments. So that's how I would think about it. Yes. I think Tami, we've got fairly modest kind of revenue growth that we're calling for here, 1% to 3%. And our incremental margins embedded in the guidance are higher than our typical long-term 35% to 40%, which is what I would still use in terms of long-term modeling. The reason why is a 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives that give us a higher incremental margin in 2024. As part of our planning process that I just described, we've now had a chance to go through all the projects and activities that contribute to a 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives, again in 2024. And I might add, these are largely independent of volume. So regardless of what volume does, we're seeing another significant contribution here, which is certainly a nice thing to have in your hip pocket in what we would describe still as a fairly uncertain and volatile environment. Sure. Yes. So I think the math is actually pretty simple for 2024. So we've got some volume leverage at that 2% to 4% revenue growth, maybe just round numbers, maybe that's about 50 basis points. The enterprise initiatives add about a 100 basis points. We're entering into what we would describe as a normal price cost environment at this point. And so there's like a modest positive contribution from our price cost efforts. And then the offset is really our continued investments in growth, including some headcount, some employee-related cost, wages and benefits, even though those costs are moderating in 2023 that's still is approximately a 100 basis points of headwind, which then gets us to that midpoint of 26% in 2024. And I might add, well, on our way to our 30% target here by 2030 that we talked about at Investor Day. Well, I think, like we've said, really most of the year we've seen some slowing in demand for CapEx and certainly in Q3 and Q4. I think as we go into 2024, as Chris just said, we've got less headwind from these customer and channel partner inventory reductions that were drag of about 1% in 2023. We have a meaningful contribution and increased contribution from new products, given all the efforts around customer-back innovation that we're driving. And then we have normal pricing, and you put all of that together and just based on, I think as you point out, it was encouraging that we saw a pickup in the sequential revenue per day from Q3 to Q4, that I think tells you that there's certainly some stability here and some of the headwinds I just described are maybe mostly behind us. We expect still a little bit of headwind from these inventory reductions as we go through the first half of the year. I think of it \u2013 we're working through our own inventory levels here and we expect to reduce our inventories in the first half. We think our customers and channel partners maybe doing some of the same, but it'll be less of a headwind here in 2024. So you put all of that together, I think you're an environment where things are pretty stable. Test and measurement you mentioned semi, it's less than 3% of our revenues. There is an expectation of a modest market pickup here in the second half. We expect to gain share and launch new products in this space. So we'll grow a little bit faster than market there. But overall, we're not expecting a big recovery in demand or the economy to pick up in the second half. This is basically based on kind of current run rates. The one outlier I'll just reiterate is automotive, we're going from a build environment in 2023, that was up in the high-single digits. We expect that to be about flat. And so the growth in automotive is all from penetration gains and continued market share and innovation in China which has been an incredible contributor to our overall growth rate and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Yes. I mean, I think the tone from customers has been pretty cautious all year, particularly on the CapEx side of things as we talked about. If you go back to our Investor Day last year, we talked a lot about accelerating our efforts to drive high quality above market organic growth primarily fueled by, as Chris said earlier, our customer-back innovation efforts. And so those are the areas, all growth related headcount ads that we're making to make sure that we have all the capability we need in terms of innovation, commercial, sales and marketing resources to drive continued progress and deliver on our above market organic growth commitments. Yes. I think by and large, if you go back historically, we haven't had great visibility to the levels of inventory in the channel and with our customers. I think we have much better visibility today, given that we've been talking about it all year. Overall, it's been a drag of a percentage point on our growth rate for the year. It was 1.5% in Q3, 1% in Q4, and I think several of our segments, we are back to kind of normal inventory levels and this is largely behind us. And then there's maybe a few other areas where there might be some continued, but certainly less headwind as we go into Q1 and Q2. And then I think at that point, we'll give you an update. I think we'll be able to say this is now completely behind us. Well, there's a little bit. I mean, obviously if you look at our run rates, it is included in our run rates at a higher level than what we might reasonably expect. So if that plays out the way we expect, that would be certainly favorable to the run rate and to the guidance that we just gave you. Hey, Sabrina. Well, I think, Sabrina, we've talked about this before, we want to maintain our price premium based on the quality and the customer service, the lead times that ITW is uniquely positioned to provide, but we also want to compete and we want to gain market share. That's kind of central to our overall enterprise strategy and the focus I just talked about around organic growth. So that's said, I think we expect a normal contribution from price here in 2024. These inflation-driven price increases are now behind us. Input cost inflation, that big wave we've been dealing with, as we sit here today, we'd say is largely behind us. And so we're entering into a normal pricing environment across the portfolio. I think that is a fair statement. If you just look at, we've now essentially recovered the margin impact from that price costs, the price cost dynamics, and we're entering into a normal environment in 2024. I'd say it's about the same, Julian. I mean, I think we \u2013 as Chris said, we just delivered 2% organic growth in 2023 in a pretty challenging environment as we talked about. And that included a point of inventory reduction impact. And I might add a point of drag from semi since it came up earlier. So if those two don't repeat, which is what we're saying, then you go from 2% to 4% pretty quickly. And we're not saying that destocking continues at the same level in the first half, which I think is what you said. We do expect it to be less of a drag in the first half. We also said the comps year-over-year are certainly more challenging in the first half than they are in the second half. So I think we're confident because when we look at everything going on inside the company and this focus on driving above market organic growth, a big focus on customer-back innovation, we look at the pipeline and new products that are being launched in every one of our divisions across the company. We look at a kind of a normal pricing environment. We feel pretty confident based on what we're seeing, as we sit here today. Now, we also said this is a pretty uncertain and volatile environment, things can change quickly. And so the thing that we have a lot of confidence is our ability to continue to read and react to whatever conditions our divisions are dealing with on the ground and deliver strong performance as we go through 2024. So we're not economists. We're not trying to forecast where the global economy is going. We're kind of basing our guidance on all the things we just talked about. And that's how we end up in that 1% to 3% range for 2024, which to us doesn't seem like a moonshot based on everything we just talked about. Yes. Price cost, I think we're kind of in a normal environment for 2024. It's not going to be a material driver of our performance. It'll be a modest contribution to margins and EPS in 2024 based on everything that we know today from a pricing and inflation standpoint. In terms of the investments, I think, our investments grow in line with our sales over time, and that's true both for customer-back innovation, it's also true for our capacity CapEx improvements that \u2013 that are all of these investments, about $800 million in 2024 are geared and centered around driving above market organic growth in every one of our divisions. And the biggest headwind, I think to margins this year was not so much the investments necessarily not just in growth, but we saw inflation in our employee-related costs just like everybody else including wages and benefits. And we expect that part of the equation to moderate here in 2024 based on some of the actions we're taking to manage those costs in 2024. So that's not going to be an increased headwind as we go forward. Sure. I would just add to that, Mig. We've talked a lot about the individual segments today. I think you got to look at ITW as the beneficiary of a highly diversified, high quality portfolio. All of our segments with margins in the high-20s, we're working through automotive, and so you're always going to have some puts and takes, which is what we're talking about. But this portfolio really gives us a level of resilience and a real competitive advantage relative to others, and puts us in a great position to perform, continue to perform at a high level in any type of demand environment over the long-term. Now, we never said that we were going to be the fastest grower. There's always going to be certain end market trends, whether it be aerospace or electrification or whatever it maybe. But you put this portfolio together in its totality. We have all the firepower that we need to deliver a 4% plus average annual organic growth as we go forward. And by the way, five of our segments are doing that, as we said earlier in 2024. So I wouldn't lose sight of the fact that, we're a business model centric company and a huge beneficiary of this high quality diversified portfolio."

            "name": "Christopher O'Herlihy",
            "content": "Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. In Q4, we delivered a solid finish to a year of high quality execution and face some pretty unique challenges, including slowing demand for CapEx, headwinds from customer and channel inventory reductions and an automotive industry strike. As a result, organic growth was essentially flat in the fourth quarter. Operating margin came in at 24.8% with 150 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives and free cash flow grew almost 40%. GAAP EPS of $2.38 included $0.04 of unfavorable impact from the devaluation of the Argentine currency. Throughout 2023, the ITW team continued to leverage the strength and resilience of the business model and our high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver a year of strong operational and financial performance, including solid organic growth of 2% on top of 12% growth in both 2021 and 2022. Operating margin of 25.1% and an improvement year-over-year of 130 basis points. Income growth of 7% to a record $4 billion, after-tax ROIC of more than 30%, 50% plus free cash flow growth and GAAP EPS of $9.74. We delivered these results while investing almost $800 million to sustain productivity and accelerate our organic growth initiatives in our highly profitable core businesses. As we outlined at our Investor Day, our key strategic priority as we enter this next phase of our enterprise strategy in 2024 is to build above market organic growth fueled by customer-back innovation into defining ITW strength on par with our world class financial and operational capabilities. Turning now to our 2024 guidance. We are encouraged by what we are seeing in terms of demand across the majority of our portfolio, along with some meaningful improvements in both customer and channel partner inventory levels and input cost inflation, as well as continued progress on customer-back innovation.  For our usual process, our organic growth projection for 2024 of 1% to 3%, and our EPS guidance of $10.20 at the midpoint, reflect current levels of demand adjusted for seasonality. Operating margin is projected to improve by about a 100 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 25.5% to 26.5%. This includes another solid contribution of approximately a 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Michael to provide more detail on the quarter and full-year performance as well as our guidance for 2024, I want to thank my ITW colleagues around the world. Their extraordinary dedication and commitment to serving our customers and executing our strategy with excellence and for their incredible support as I transition into the CEO role. Michael? Yes. Sure, Steve. So on Food Equipment, projecting 3% to 5% growth next year, really on the back of a few different aspects. Firstly, as always, with Food Equipment, it's a very fertile environment for innovation. So we see several new product launches across all product categories. We would expect less channel destocking Food Equipment in 2024. And also I would say we have a continued recovery in service. As I think, service is about one-third of our revenues in food. We're the only major manufacturer with that captive service business and service is a business that's still in recovery pretty much from COVID, equipment has recovered, but we will see probably the final year of recovery in service in 2024, and all that is adding up to a 3% to 5% growth rate in food next year. Good morning. Yes. That's correct, Andy. In terms of specialty particularly, we're doing some strategic portfolio work there heavier, I would say amount of product line pruning than we normally expect in a normal maintenance environment. We're doing quite a bit more on specialty really to position that segment for long-term growth of 4% plus. So that's what's going on there, and we're pretty pleased with the progress around that. On construction, it is very much a market story. I mean, obviously, all three main markets for us, North America, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand are all forecasting significantly declines in housing bills next year, that will be 11% in North America, mid-single digits in Europe and high-single digits in A and Z. So that's really what's impacting the construction business. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. Well, I think welding, so we're not counting on a market acceleration, just to be clear. This is if you look at in a normal market environment, just assume for a minute, let's assume the market is flat. The contribution from new products and normal price very quickly gets you to something in the low-single digits. So I just want to be clear around that. The other thing I'd say, just on the margins. We talked a little about the year-over-year inventory revaluations. That's what caused the margins to drop in the fourth quarter, below 30%. And we expect that to be back above 30% here in the first quarter as that one-time kind of year-over-year inventory impact is behind us. So we would expect margins to kind of remain in that 30% plus as we go through 2024. And as I said earlier, that's not unusual. Every one of our segments told us as part of this bottom up planning process that they are on target to improve their operating margin performance in 2024. Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. I think it is. I mean, as we say, in our four to seven calculus that we outlined at our Investor Day, you have a contribution from market \u2013 contribution from market penetration, and the largest contribution is actually from customer-back innovation. And that's what we're seeing here in 2024 really across most of our businesses. As we used to think about growth, 2% growth last year on top of 2021 \u2013 or 12% growth in 2021 and 2022 and targeting 1% to 3% here on the path to four plus, is kind of how are outlining this. And I would say that it's a target and a goal that we're very confident on the basis that it's where the bulk of our divisions are spending their time. We're making progress, certainly more to do, but given the portfolio, given the fact that we've got plenty of room to grow in each segment, given the investments that Michael has been talking about that we've been making now for quite a few years in strategic marketing and innovation. We're really putting ourselves and building the muscle here to get into a position where we will grow 4% plus over the entirety of this next phase. And I think in terms of just capability build, if you think about this in the way that \u2013 the way we leaned into front to back 80/20 in the last phase of our strategy, that's the way we're leaning into innovation in the next phase of our strategy. The same level of rigor, scope, and capability building that we applied to front to back 80/20 in the first phase. We are now applying to customer-back innovation here in this next phase. And I would say we're very encouraged by the progress that we've seen on innovation over the last couple of years. It was a 1% contributor five years ago. It's now a 2% contributor on its way to 3% and beyond. And again, very encouraged by the progress that we're seeing across many of our divisions in terms of the qualitative work they're doing on innovation, but also in terms of the quality of the innovation pipeline across all seven segments. Yes. I think in our overall guidance here of 1% to 3% organic, that's where you'll find all the major geographies. So North America, in that low single-digit, 1% to 3% range. And Europe kind of similar to North America, definitely we've seen some challenges on the construction side as you pointed out, but kind of you put it all together, it's in that one to three range. And then the China is more positive, but that's really driven by the automotive business, which is more than half of our revenues in China. So we expect another double-digit type growth for the auto business in China. And that takes China to kind of the mid single-digit range in 2024. Sure. Good morning. Good morning, Mig. Yes. So Mig, I would say that, we're probably seeing our growth across most of our portfolio. I would use, auto as an example, think about flat bills in 2024. We're talking about 3% to 5% on auto as an example. We've historically outgrown in food equipment. As I think, if you look at some of the comparisons and so on. Also with welding and with construction, large down market here in 2023 which we outgrew, so we have the capacity to outgrow across much of our segment. And with respect to investments, I think we've been making these focused targeted investments for some time now. This is not new news. This is something we've been doing for a few years to really position ourselves to grow at 4% plus across the enterprise over this next phase. And I think the big driver of that, as we said a few times is customer-back innovation, is leaning on customer-back innovation that we've been working on for a couple of years, and we'll accelerate over this next phase. And that's really what will drive the outgrowth going forward. And that customer-back innovation opportunity resides in every segment on the basis of the level of differentiation in every segment, the share runway opportunity we have in every segment. So we would expect every segment in time to meaningfully contribute to that 4% plus organic growth. Yes. Sure, Mig. So effectively, we are very much sticking to our disciplined portfolio management strategy, which is very consistent in terms of \u2013 we are certainly interested in high quality acquisitions where we can find them that extend our long-term growth potential to grow at a minimum 4% plus at high quality. That's the primary kind of lens, we look at acquisitions. We've been able to leverage the business model to improve margins. And so we certainly review opportunities on an ongoing basis, but we're pretty selective here about acquisitions, given the fact that we believe we've got a lot of organic growth potential that we're going to execute on here over the next few years. If I think about MTS as an example of the typical \u2013 attractive candidate, we look at and ticked all the boxes in terms of strategic attraction, in terms of differentiation, solving customer pain points, opportunity to leverage the business model to improve margins. And having owned that business now for just over two years because we stuck to the characteristics that we believe in with respect to acquisitions. This is an acquisition that's turning on to be a home run and will be a great ITW business in the long-term. So it's a real blueprint for how we think about acquisitions and how we'd be thinking about acquisitions going forward. Sure."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Krista. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2023 conference call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; Vice Chairman, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss ITW\u2019s third quarter financial results and provide an update on our full year 2023 outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you are all aware, on September 7, we announced our CEO succession plan, wherein I will be turning over the CEO role to my colleague, Chris O'Herlihy at year-end. Chris is an exceptional leader with deep expertise in ITW's highly differentiated business model, our focused strategy to leverage it to full potential and the company's unique one-of-a-kind culture. He has been an invaluable partner and collaborator with me over the past 11 years. We have worked closely together to prepare for this transition. He is more than ready and he will do an exceptional job as ITW's next CEO. If you allow me a brief bit of reflection in the last 11 years, I will simply say that everything we did was driven by our fundamental belief in the performance power of the differentiated set of strategic and operational capabilities and practices that we refer to as the ITW business model. In this past phase, we focused on getting the company properly positioned to be able to leverage them to their full potential over the long term. With this as our foundation, ITW enters our next phase in a position of great strength and resilience with these unique skills and capabilities sharply honed. I wholeheartedly believe that there will be an even bigger source of competitive advantage and differentiated performance in the company's next phase than they were in the last one, especially if you believe as I do that the level of volatility and unpredictability of the world will only increase from here forward. I have absolutely no doubt that Chris and the incredibly talented ITW leadership team behind him will utilize all of the differentiated tools at ITW's disposal to read and react to whatever comes our way and lead the company to even greater heights in our next phase. Let me close by saying that it has been both a privilege and an honor to lead this great company for the last 11 years. And I offer my deepest gratitude to all of my ITW colleagues past and present for all of their support and for their unwavering commitment to working every day to be the best ITW that we can be. With that, it is now my pleasure to turn the call and in a few months, the company over to Chris O'Herlihy. Chris, over to you.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to thank Scott and our Board of Directors for their trust and confidence in electing me as ITW's next CEO. I'm incredibly humbled by the opportunity to lead this great company, our exceptionally talented leadership team and our 46,000 dedicated colleagues around the world. As Scott said, as a result of the work done over the last 11 years in executing our enterprise strategy to leverage the ITW business model to its full potential, our company has never performed better or been better positioned for the future. The central focus of the next phase of our enterprise strategy is to elevate high quality organic growth and customer back innovation as key ITW differentiators on par with our best-in-class operational capabilities and financial performance. Our leadership team and I are deeply committed to doing just that in delivering on ITW's 2030 Enterprise Performance Goals. Now, let's turn to our Q3 performance. The strength and resilience of ITW's proprietary business model and high-quality diversified portfolio once again drove strong operational execution and financial performance this quarter. Starting with the top line, organic growth was 2% on an equal days basis, as demand for CapEx slowed down in test and measurement and electronics and welding. Our margin and income performance continues to be very robust. Operating margin improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 26.5% as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points. Quarterly operating income grew 9% to $1.1 billion. GAAP EPS grew 9% to $2.55 and free cash flow was up 40%. With three quarters behind us, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $9.65 to $9.85, which now incorporates a $0.12 adjustment to the impact of the auto strike in Q4. Looking ahead at the balance of the year, the company remains well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated performance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q3 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Organic growth in the third quarter was essentially flat and plus 2% on an equal days basis as Q3 this year had one less shipping day compared to Q3 last year. Foreign currency translation impact was favorable by 1.5% and divestitures reduced revenue by 1.2%. The net result was revenue growth of 0.5%. Third quarter operating margin was 26.5%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points and price cost margin impact was positive 210 basis points. GAAP EPS of $2.55 was up 9% and included $0.07 net of favorable corporate items on a year-over-year basis starting with unallocated expense, which improved by $43 million due to lower employee related expenses, including health and welfare and a one-time insurance recovery. This favorable item was partially offset by $16 million of lower other income, primarily due to lower investment income. As I said, the net effect of these two items was favorable $0.07 net per share. Free cash flow grew 40% to $856 million, with a conversion to net income of 111% as we continue to make solid progress on returning to our normal historical inventory levels. We repurchased $375 million of our shares this quarter and raised our dividend by 7% to an annualized payout of $5.60 per share, which marks our 60th year of raising the dividend. In summary, Q3 was another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. Turning to Slide 4, organic revenue growth by geography. As you can see, North America was down 2%, Europe was about flat, and Asia Pacific was up 6%, with China up 8%, driven by the Automotive OEM segment. Excluding auto, China was down 1%. Moving to the segments and starting with our Automotive OEM, organic growth was 4%. North America was down 5%, Europe was up 5% and China was up 18%. There was essentially no impact on Automotive OEM segment revenues from the auto strike in Q3. But as Chris noted, that will not be the case in Q4. As a reminder, our North American Automotive OEM business represents approximately 40% of total segment revenues. And within that 40%, approximately two-thirds of our annual sales are tied to D3 automotive customers. Included in our updated earnings guidance today is our estimate that the impact of the auto strike will reduce our Q4 earnings by $0.12 per share, which is essentially based on October D3 domestic production levels continuing through the remainder of the quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered solid organic growth of 6% as Equipment was up 5% and Service grew 9%. North America grew 10%, with institutional sales up in the mid-teens, restaurants up high single digits and retail up in the high teens on the back of new product rollouts. Europe, however, was flat and Asia Pacific was up 6%. In Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down 4%, weighed down six percentage points by semiconductor-related demand, which represents about 15% of segments and for context, only 3% of ITW revenues. Overall, Test & Measurement grew 2% and as demand for CapEx slowed in the quarter and Electronics declined 13%. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding's organic revenue declined 2%, as Equipment revenue was down 3% on the back of softer demand for CapEx. Consumables were down 1% as industrial sales declined 9% versus a tough comparison of plus 30% last year. Commercial, however, was up 6% against an easier year-over-year comparison of down 10%. Overall, though North America revenue was down 3% and international was essentially flat. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue grew 3% as automotive aftermarket grew 10% due to the launch of new products. Polymers was down 1% and Fluids was down 4%. Margins were solid as operating margin improved 280 basis points to 28.1%. Turning to Slide 7, organic revenue in Construction was down 2%, as North America grew 2%, with residential up 2% with some strength on the residential renovation side, which was up 7%. Commercial construction was down 2%. International markets were soft, with Europe down 8%; and Australia and New Zealand down 4%. Margins were solid as operating margin improved 420 basis points to 29.9% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and price cost. Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue was down 6%. North America was down 9% and international grew 1%. Consumables were down 9% and Equipment revenue, which represents about 20% of the segment, was up 9%. Moving to Slide 8 and our updated full year 2023 guidance, as you saw this morning, we are narrowing the range of our GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $9.65 to $9.85 which, as I mentioned earlier, includes a $0.12 adjustment for the estimated auto strike impact in Q4. Based on current levels of demand exiting Q3, including the estimated impact of the auto strike, we're projecting organic growth of 2% to 3% for the full year. We are raising our full year operating margin guidance to 25% to 25.5%, to reflect our stronger margin performance exiting the third quarter, and we expect that margins for the full year will improve by 150 basis points at the midpoint, including a contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We are projecting free cash flow conversion of more than 100% of net income for the year. So while the overall demand environment clearly has some uncertainties in the near-term, inventory normalization, elevated interest rates, increasing CapEx caution and the auto strike just to mention a few. The entire team at ITW remains focused on leveraging ITW's unique strengths and capabilities to optimize our ability to continue to deliver differentiated long-term performance. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Michael. Krista, please open the lines up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Good morning Scott and Chris and Michael and Karen.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nScott Davis: I was -- the price/cost positive 200 basis -- 210, was better. I think we were thinking just some simple math kind of more like 100, 150. What -- were you able to get more, price in the quarter? Or was it lower cost or a little bit of both? Or just a little color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So let me give you a little bit of context here. So we are definitely on track to recover the margin impact now from more than two years of unprecedented inflation, which now appears to have stabilized. There's definitely still some pressure on the cost side, on the labor side, components as well as energy. That said we've made some good progress. Price/cost was positive 190 basis points in Q1, 216 in Q2, which was the peak and then 210 here in the third quarter. And we're now looking at somewhere around 150 basis points in Q4, and that would put us around 200 basis points recovery for the full year. Price is holding, and we're seeing a little bit of deflation on the -- more on the commodity side. So these would be the metals, in particular, which drove the stronger performance here on price/cost in the third quarter.\nScott Davis: That's helpful. Chris, I know it's early. You've got another couple of months, but is there kind of a plan for the first 90 days? Or where do you see the -- I guess the focus shifting, is there a little bit more emphasis on portfolio or -- I know you mentioned kind of driving higher growth rates, but they're just -- given the diversity of end markets you sell into, there's just so much you can do on that front. But maybe just a little color on where you planning on spending your first kind of three to six months and focusing?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So Scott, I would say, in general, our plan is very much in line with what we outlined at our Investor Day in terms of really ensuring that we continue to strengthen our foundation, which is our business model and obviously then building organic growth as a core strength on par with our operational capabilities and financial performance over time. I think the first 90 days I'm just learning the job, just go out and pretty good understanding of our businesses already, but obviously, working with our businesses to make sure that our strategy is well part of dominant businesses, which, of course, it is, that's really the plan for the first 90 days, I would say. But it's really in the context of being very committed to this -- the strategy for the next phase, which is to sustain the strong foundation we have around our business model, we're really leaning in and continuing to build our organic growth capabilities to be on par with our operational capabilities and our financial performance.\nScott Davis: Okay. Best of luck. Thanks all. And congrats, Scott, a fantastic run, really exceptional. So thank you all. Best of luck.\nScott Santi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much. So my first question is, I wanted to understand the operating margin expansion a bit better, 200 basis points, enterprise initiative 140, price/cost 210. So what was the drag to get to the 200 basis points expansion. I remember you were investing in labor and compensation this year. Is that still there? And when do you expect that to taper off, especially as you look into 2024?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. Good morning, Tami. So you're right. If you look at the margin improvement year-over-year, another really strong contribution from Enterprise Industries. I think the best performance in 2.5 years, which is really remarkable given where we're at in the enterprise strategy. Price/cost, we talked about 210, and then 160 basis points of, I don't want to call it headwind necessarily because these are investments that we're making in our long-term organic growth initiatives, including new hires as well as then, obviously, the regular wage and benefit inflation that everybody else is seeing. That all adds up to about 160 basis points. And that's how you get to -- even with all of those investments, that we continue to make, you're getting 200 basis points of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis to 26.5%, which I believe was a new record for the third quarter.\nTami Zakaria: Does that 150 basis points headwind continue in the fourth quarter and maybe in the next several quarters, how should we think about that headwind?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think the normal run rate is somewhere -- we've been running higher than that this year. The normal run rate and we'll see how the plans roll up for next year. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But if you look at historically, that's about 100 to 150 basis points of headwind.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Can I ask one more quick one? The $0.12 headwind from the auto strike you're calling out for the fourth quarter. Does that assume the strike continues through the end of the quarter? And what does that mean in terms of organic growth headwind for the fourth quarter?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So Tami, let me just broaden the lens maybe a little bit here. I think given the uncertainty around auto and the fact that the strike is now in the sixth week here, we decided that we take a more prudent approach, which is basically based on what we're seeing in our businesses right now, maybe with room for things deteriorating a little bit further from where they are today. And if you take that quarter-to-date impact and extrapolate through year-end, that's how you get the $0.12 of EPS adjustment that's now embedded in our guidance. So assuming -- to answer your question, it continues through year-end. If the strike ends before year-end, obviously, we'll do better than that. If it gets worse, our businesses will do a great job in terms of reading and reacting to the conditions on the ground. The optimist might say that some of those -- that production will get deferred into next year. But obviously, a lot of uncertainty, and given that we don't really want to pin down a revenue number, we're just going to give you here the $0.12 of adjustment that I just laid out for you.\nTami Zakaria: Great. Thank you, so much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nAndrew Obin: So question, I think before you were talking about sort of 25% of the portfolio slowing structure over the past couple of quarters. Have any of those markets bottom like electronics? And have any new markets started to slow? Or is it the same 25%? Just how do you look at the world?\nMichael Larsen: Hi Andrew, so there's definitely some puts and takes. I think, for example, if you had asked me that question last quarter, I would have said automotive OEM -- automotive aftermarket would be in that category. They were up 10%. So just an example of things moving in and out. So I'm not sure it's really that relevant to look at. But if you just look at what we would say now is kind of slowing to 25% on a combined basis, those businesses were down year-over-year, 3% in the third quarter. However, sequentially, they did improve from the second quarter by a percentage point, which I would say fairly stable. Talking about electronics and semi specifically, I think consumer electronics remains fairly weak. On the semiconductor side, you will recall that we've talked about an expectation from industry experts, I'll call them as well as our customers that there would be a reacceleration of demand here in the second half of this year. And that now looks like it's been deferred probably until sometime next year. Now obviously, we remain, as we now do on an ongoing basis, committed to those businesses. We continue to invest and really position ourselves for the inevitable recovery down the road, which hopefully comes next year in 2024 and making sure that we're well positioned to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunities that we believe are right in front of us in that part of our businesses, so.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And then maybe you've answered this question as you talked about the business overall, but in Construction Products and Polymers & Fluids, the changes in variable margin cost was a material benefit to margin year-over-year and has been year-to-date. Anything specific that you're doing in these businesses and how much more runway is there?\nMichael Larsen: Well, there's a lot of work that's going on in those businesses to deliver these results. Obviously, I'd say the categories you're familiar with, the first one is the ongoing contribution from the enterprise initiatives. And so both the segments that you mentioned had a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives as well as favorable price/cost impact. So those are really the two big drivers in those businesses. And I think it is pretty remarkable that they're putting up record quarterly margin performance given, frankly, not a lot of volume growth, not a lot of volume leverage. So you can imagine once we get the volume leverage going again, as Chris was talking about at incrementals kind of in that 35 to 40 range, there's even more runway for margin improvement.\nAndrew Obin: Thank you so much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations, Scott. Within the Welding segment, it seemed like the year-over-year was a little weaker on the industrial side relative to last quarter and maybe a little better on the commercial. Is that something that you're projecting at least in the near term? And to what extent is there a margin mix difference between those two subsegments that you could be aware of?\nMichael Larsen: So there's not a lot of difference in terms of the margin performance. But I think this is -- these are some great data points that illustrate kind of the dynamic nature of the environment that we're operating in. And really, what I tried to lay out in the commentary was what's driving this on a year-over-year basis are just a comparison. So it's really hard to draw any conclusions from the year-over-year comparisons. What I think we can say broadly in Welding, as we said upfront, is that the overall demand for equipment appears to be slowing down a little bit in the near term, whether that will remain at those levels on a go-forward basis is difficult to say at this point. Backlogs have normalized. We're not really a backlog-driven company. We're now back to two to three weeks of backlog at the enterprise level. And then the last point I'll make is we're still seeing meaningful impact from our customers and channel partners reducing their levels of inventory. So if you think about at the enterprise level, that was a point to 1.5 points of organic growth drag. So just to maybe normalize the Q3 results a little bit on the top line. So 2% on an equal days basis, and then you factor in the inventory adjustments, you're back at 3, 3.5 just to kind of put things in context a little bit. But there's no question that the activity slowed down a little bit on the welding side here in the third quarter.\nSteven Fisher: Okay, that's helpful. And then when would you get an idea of how your price versus cost is going to shape up for 2024? I'm getting the sense broadly in industrial it is going to be pretty tight. Would you agree with that? And is that something you can sort of 80/20 to kind of tilted in your favor?\nMichael Larsen: Well, so we haven't even rolled up our plans yet for next year. That really happens at the end of this month, and then we'll have some good discussions with our segments and we'll get a much better handle on what the price/cost equation might look like. I do think if you just look at the margin recovery trajectory that we're on. We haven't fully recovered the margin impact. And so I think it's not unreasonable to assume that there will be some carryover into maybe the first half of next year. And then you add on top of that maybe our normal pricing. But again, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. We'll give you a lot more detail when we give you guidance for the full year, which will be early next year. But certainly, if you're -- price is holding at current levels and the raw material cost -- direct material cost equation, those has stabilized. We're not seeing significant deflation at this point, but we're also not seeing anything close to the inflation that we've seen over the last two years. So, that's kind of the good news here.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. Good morning. Maybe one area was interested in was Test & Measurement and Electronics. Also, in light of sort of progress on the integration of the acquisition, how that's gone as it's been in the portfolio several quarters now? And also just on the base business, very mixed to reads some of various peers in that market. Any color you could give us or kind of expectations for Q4 on Electronics versus, say, Test & Measurement within that, please?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So, Julian, we don't give quarterly guidance. But I think if you look at historical information, you'll see that there's typically a ramp-up in Test & Measurement and Electronics in Q4 relative to Q3. And so we do expect some of that. I think overall, on the Electronics side, like I said, the consumer electronics end market remains soft. Just semi in isolation is down 20%, 25% on a year-over-year basis. And that's -- last year, that was about a $500 million segment. So, we're definitely seeing -- that's what's driving these results. If you take out the semi impact in Test & Measurement and Electronics we're actually up 2% on a year-over-year basis. But we expect this pressure to continue. We're not counting on a recovery here in the fourth quarter. It's based on run rate and typical seasonality I'd say on MTS overall, maybe, Chris, do you want to make some comments? You were just up there. So, maybe you want to--\nChristopherO'Herlihy: Yes. So, I would say, Julian, that certainly the assumptions we made when we acquired the MTS business in terms of strategic fit and financial rationale have been very much validated by our two years of owning the business. The business has performed very well. We are currently in the process of implementing our business model. We're already starting to see some real nice results accruing from that. But we strongly feel this is going to be a very, very successful ITW acquisition. In fact, we are taking our Board of Directors up to MTS later this week for them to witness firsthand the level of progress that we've made on the integration in terms of implementing our business model. But like I say, two years in, so far so good. Great people, great brands, great technology, great opportunity to improve the business model, and like I said, this is going to be a great ITW business in the long term.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. And I would just add maybe to quantify what Chris is talking about in the short term. This business grew double-digit top line in the third quarter. And you'll recall maybe margins coming in were somewhere around 7%. And through the implementation of the business model, at this point, we are -- the outlook for the full year is in the mid-teens. So right on track in terms of the potential that we thought we had when we acquired the business. So good progress.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And good to hear on MTS. Maybe just a broader question, perhaps amidst the sort of the CEO transition that was announced and congratulations to both Scott and Chris. But maybe on the sort of thinking about the top line a little bit and it looks like maybe some of the share gains that ITW had enjoyed just after COVID maybe have eased to-date or eased in the last 12 months or so. I realize there's some destocking noise in various channels and so looking at market share in that context may not be that helpful. But just wanted sort of perspectives on market share across the larger ITW businesses and whether there's perhaps a need to redeploy a greater share of enterprise initiatives or price/cost savings into sort of organic reinvestment in the base business?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then, Chris, you can jump in. I think I'll start by saying we completely disagree with the premise that we are not gaining market share. Recognizing that it may be difficult for you looking in from the outside to decipher those market share gains on an annual basis, but if you go to every one of our divisions, they will have a very clear picture, all 84 of them in terms of what market growth is and what their growth rate is and what their competitors are growing at. And in all cases, we would say that given our competitive advantages that we derive from the business model in terms of our customer-facing metrics, in terms of our -- the value add that our customers are getting from buying our products, we're continuing to gain share in the markets that we're focused on. And in some cases, you're able to look at public company peers you can peel back the onion a little bit. And if you do that work -- if you were to do that work, Julian you'll see that we are gaining market share in the areas that we are focused on. And I might just add, not only are we gaining market share, but I'll just note the margin performance of our businesses relative to our competitors which typically we are running at two, three times, our competitors, and you can look at Food Equipment and Lincoln and the Welding side, for example, and you'll see that, that is the case. But maybe, Chris, if you want to comment a little bit?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes, I would echo everything Michael just said in terms of the quality of our portfolio, in terms of the amount of room we have to grow in each segment customer-facing performance and so on and the focused investments that we've made in areas like sales and innovation, coupled with the fact that we've seen a nicely improving yield on customer-back innovation. All this gives the credence to what we're hearing from our businesses that we are getting share in most of our key markets in relation to our competition.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMig Dobre: Yes. Thank you. Good morning and congrats to Scott and Chris. Just a quick question on construction. In your comments, you mentioned that the resi renovation channel has done doing quite well. Maybe a little more color there. Is that a function of new products or anything going on in the channel? I just found that to be a little bit surprising given where productivity and interest rates and all of that seems to be?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So again, Mig, you're right. This is on the residential renovation remodel side of things. So these are typically sales through big box retailers, names that you'd be familiar with. And I think if you look at I think somebody asked earlier about market share, this is a great example of really strong market share gains in this particular end market, because I agree with you, if you just look at the underlying data, you might be a little surprised that, that part of the business is up 7% year-over-year in the current interest rate environment. And like I said, this is essentially all volume and share gain through the big box retailers.\nMig Dobre: And presumably, that has some staying power beyond this quarter?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think that overall construction in North America actually remains fairly stable. I'd say maybe a little bit more concern on the international side, which has been weak. The market demand has been a lot softer on the international side. But North America \u2013 keep in mind that in the fourth quarter, typically, we talked about seasonality by segment, I said Test & Measurement usually does better. Construction is one where, for obvious reasons, the fourth quarter is typically a little bit lower than the third quarter. But in terms of the share gains and our \u2013 the strength in this particular part of the business, that absolutely has staying power.\nMig Dobre: Great. Then my follow-up, maybe on Food Equipment. I'm curious as to how the supply chain has sort of evolved for you here and where your lead times are? I know you've got a number of verticals within this segment, but some context there would be helpful. And also, where are you from a backlog perspective? Are you seeing any sort of noise in the channel around destocking? Or is the segment perhaps less impacted than others? Thanks.\nMichael Larsen: So Mig, just from a lead time perspective, I would say that a natural outcome of our business model is best-in-class lead times and customer-facing performance. And we are very much back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of our ability to supply our customers. In terms of the channel, yes, I think it's an area where there is a little bit of inventory in the channel. We're seeing that coming down. It's probably still out there. It's one of the segments that has been impacted, I think, by channel inventory likely to come down over the next couple of quarters here, but it's fair for sure.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. And then just on the backlog, we're back to normal levels which, in our case, given our customer delivery performance is two to three weeks. So we're back to kind of normal levels here.\nMig Dobre: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to both Scott and Chris. I guess, I wanted to stay on that topic in terms of the channel inventory normalization it is something you talked about last quarter. I think size is pretty similarly last quarter. And so the question is just any changes that you've seen from kind of June, July into where we are now in terms of the trends on some of that inventory rationalization, whether regions, end-markets, pace of it or if it's all kind of trending in line with expectations as of a couple of months ago?\nMichael Larsen: I'd say this is trending right in line with expectations that we kind of laid out on the last call. Like I said, the drag on the organic growth rate of 1% to 1.5% was pretty broad-based, every segment had some impact, very similar Q3 as Q2, and we think this will probably be with us for a few more quarters. And I'd just say, if you just look at our own inventory levels, we are currently running slightly above three months on hand, where typically we're running at low-twos. And we estimate that in our case, it will take us probably until kind of early mid next year to get back to normal inventory levels as we work through the exact same things that our customers and channel partners are working through. And I might just add here that that's obviously going to continue to drive some really strong free cash flow performance for ITW as inventory levels, working capital continues to normalize, as a result of supply chain having stabilized.\nJoe O'Dea: And then, how does that kind of compare, relate to some of what you're seeing from your customers right now, I think, in the prepared remarks, you talked about maybe a little bit of slower kind of CapEx demand trends out of your customers. What you're seeing in sort of test and measurement or welding and the degree to what you're hearing from customers is this is more inventory related or if it's something that's a little bit of a pause that's more maybe macro uncertainty related?\nMichael Larsen: I think it's really hard to tell. I mean, I think overall, the demand environment, as we said there's, clearly some uncertainties here in the near-term. Inventory as part of that, the interest rate environment, everybody being maybe a little bit more cautious on the CapEx side and then in of our segments, particularly, the auto strike. So there's, a lot of things going on here. It is a pretty dynamic environment, it can change pretty quickly. The only thing we know for sure is that, the ITW team will continue to read and react to whatever conditions are on the ground. And I think if you just look at our track record, we'll continue to deliver differentiated long-term performance. And so that's really our focus is on continuing to do just that.\nJoe O'Dea: Understood. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Organic growth in the third quarter was essentially flat and plus 2% on an equal days basis as Q3 this year had one less shipping day compared to Q3 last year. Foreign currency translation impact was favorable by 1.5% and divestitures reduced revenue by 1.2%. The net result was revenue growth of 0.5%. Third quarter operating margin was 26.5%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points and price cost margin impact was positive 210 basis points. GAAP EPS of $2.55 was up 9% and included $0.07 net of favorable corporate items on a year-over-year basis starting with unallocated expense, which improved by $43 million due to lower employee related expenses, including health and welfare and a one-time insurance recovery. This favorable item was partially offset by $16 million of lower other income, primarily due to lower investment income. As I said, the net effect of these two items was favorable $0.07 net per share. Free cash flow grew 40% to $856 million, with a conversion to net income of 111% as we continue to make solid progress on returning to our normal historical inventory levels. We repurchased $375 million of our shares this quarter and raised our dividend by 7% to an annualized payout of $5.60 per share, which marks our 60th year of raising the dividend. In summary, Q3 was another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. Turning to Slide 4, organic revenue growth by geography. As you can see, North America was down 2%, Europe was about flat, and Asia Pacific was up 6%, with China up 8%, driven by the Automotive OEM segment. Excluding auto, China was down 1%. Moving to the segments and starting with our Automotive OEM, organic growth was 4%. North America was down 5%, Europe was up 5% and China was up 18%. There was essentially no impact on Automotive OEM segment revenues from the auto strike in Q3. But as Chris noted, that will not be the case in Q4. As a reminder, our North American Automotive OEM business represents approximately 40% of total segment revenues. And within that 40%, approximately two-thirds of our annual sales are tied to D3 automotive customers. Included in our updated earnings guidance today is our estimate that the impact of the auto strike will reduce our Q4 earnings by $0.12 per share, which is essentially based on October D3 domestic production levels continuing through the remainder of the quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered solid organic growth of 6% as Equipment was up 5% and Service grew 9%. North America grew 10%, with institutional sales up in the mid-teens, restaurants up high single digits and retail up in the high teens on the back of new product rollouts. Europe, however, was flat and Asia Pacific was up 6%. In Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down 4%, weighed down six percentage points by semiconductor-related demand, which represents about 15% of segments and for context, only 3% of ITW revenues. Overall, Test & Measurement grew 2% and as demand for CapEx slowed in the quarter and Electronics declined 13%. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding's organic revenue declined 2%, as Equipment revenue was down 3% on the back of softer demand for CapEx. Consumables were down 1% as industrial sales declined 9% versus a tough comparison of plus 30% last year. Commercial, however, was up 6% against an easier year-over-year comparison of down 10%. Overall, though North America revenue was down 3% and international was essentially flat. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue grew 3% as automotive aftermarket grew 10% due to the launch of new products. Polymers was down 1% and Fluids was down 4%. Margins were solid as operating margin improved 280 basis points to 28.1%. Turning to Slide 7, organic revenue in Construction was down 2%, as North America grew 2%, with residential up 2% with some strength on the residential renovation side, which was up 7%. Commercial construction was down 2%. International markets were soft, with Europe down 8%; and Australia and New Zealand down 4%. Margins were solid as operating margin improved 420 basis points to 29.9% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and price cost. Finally, Specialty Products, organic revenue was down 6%. North America was down 9% and international grew 1%. Consumables were down 9% and Equipment revenue, which represents about 20% of the segment, was up 9%. Moving to Slide 8 and our updated full year 2023 guidance, as you saw this morning, we are narrowing the range of our GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $9.65 to $9.85 which, as I mentioned earlier, includes a $0.12 adjustment for the estimated auto strike impact in Q4. Based on current levels of demand exiting Q3, including the estimated impact of the auto strike, we're projecting organic growth of 2% to 3% for the full year. We are raising our full year operating margin guidance to 25% to 25.5%, to reflect our stronger margin performance exiting the third quarter, and we expect that margins for the full year will improve by 150 basis points at the midpoint, including a contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We are projecting free cash flow conversion of more than 100% of net income for the year. So while the overall demand environment clearly has some uncertainties in the near-term, inventory normalization, elevated interest rates, increasing CapEx caution and the auto strike just to mention a few. The entire team at ITW remains focused on leveraging ITW's unique strengths and capabilities to optimize our ability to continue to deliver differentiated long-term performance. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Good morning. Yes. So let me give you a little bit of context here. So we are definitely on track to recover the margin impact now from more than two years of unprecedented inflation, which now appears to have stabilized. There's definitely still some pressure on the cost side, on the labor side, components as well as energy. That said we've made some good progress. Price/cost was positive 190 basis points in Q1, 216 in Q2, which was the peak and then 210 here in the third quarter. And we're now looking at somewhere around 150 basis points in Q4, and that would put us around 200 basis points recovery for the full year. Price is holding, and we're seeing a little bit of deflation on the -- more on the commodity side. So these would be the metals, in particular, which drove the stronger performance here on price/cost in the third quarter. Yes. Good morning, Tami. So you're right. If you look at the margin improvement year-over-year, another really strong contribution from Enterprise Industries. I think the best performance in 2.5 years, which is really remarkable given where we're at in the enterprise strategy. Price/cost, we talked about 210, and then 160 basis points of, I don't want to call it headwind necessarily because these are investments that we're making in our long-term organic growth initiatives, including new hires as well as then, obviously, the regular wage and benefit inflation that everybody else is seeing. That all adds up to about 160 basis points. And that's how you get to -- even with all of those investments, that we continue to make, you're getting 200 basis points of margin improvement on a year-over-year basis to 26.5%, which I believe was a new record for the third quarter. Yes, I think the normal run rate is somewhere -- we've been running higher than that this year. The normal run rate and we'll see how the plans roll up for next year. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But if you look at historically, that's about 100 to 150 basis points of headwind. Yes. So Tami, let me just broaden the lens maybe a little bit here. I think given the uncertainty around auto and the fact that the strike is now in the sixth week here, we decided that we take a more prudent approach, which is basically based on what we're seeing in our businesses right now, maybe with room for things deteriorating a little bit further from where they are today. And if you take that quarter-to-date impact and extrapolate through year-end, that's how you get the $0.12 of EPS adjustment that's now embedded in our guidance. So assuming -- to answer your question, it continues through year-end. If the strike ends before year-end, obviously, we'll do better than that. If it gets worse, our businesses will do a great job in terms of reading and reacting to the conditions on the ground. The optimist might say that some of those -- that production will get deferred into next year. But obviously, a lot of uncertainty, and given that we don't really want to pin down a revenue number, we're just going to give you here the $0.12 of adjustment that I just laid out for you. Sure. Good morning. Hi Andrew, so there's definitely some puts and takes. I think, for example, if you had asked me that question last quarter, I would have said automotive OEM -- automotive aftermarket would be in that category. They were up 10%. So just an example of things moving in and out. So I'm not sure it's really that relevant to look at. But if you just look at what we would say now is kind of slowing to 25% on a combined basis, those businesses were down year-over-year, 3% in the third quarter. However, sequentially, they did improve from the second quarter by a percentage point, which I would say fairly stable. Talking about electronics and semi specifically, I think consumer electronics remains fairly weak. On the semiconductor side, you will recall that we've talked about an expectation from industry experts, I'll call them as well as our customers that there would be a reacceleration of demand here in the second half of this year. And that now looks like it's been deferred probably until sometime next year. Now obviously, we remain, as we now do on an ongoing basis, committed to those businesses. We continue to invest and really position ourselves for the inevitable recovery down the road, which hopefully comes next year in 2024 and making sure that we're well positioned to take full advantage of the long-term growth opportunities that we believe are right in front of us in that part of our businesses, so. Well, there's a lot of work that's going on in those businesses to deliver these results. Obviously, I'd say the categories you're familiar with, the first one is the ongoing contribution from the enterprise initiatives. And so both the segments that you mentioned had a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives as well as favorable price/cost impact. So those are really the two big drivers in those businesses. And I think it is pretty remarkable that they're putting up record quarterly margin performance given, frankly, not a lot of volume growth, not a lot of volume leverage. So you can imagine once we get the volume leverage going again, as Chris was talking about at incrementals kind of in that 35 to 40 range, there's even more runway for margin improvement. Sure. So there's not a lot of difference in terms of the margin performance. But I think this is -- these are some great data points that illustrate kind of the dynamic nature of the environment that we're operating in. And really, what I tried to lay out in the commentary was what's driving this on a year-over-year basis are just a comparison. So it's really hard to draw any conclusions from the year-over-year comparisons. What I think we can say broadly in Welding, as we said upfront, is that the overall demand for equipment appears to be slowing down a little bit in the near term, whether that will remain at those levels on a go-forward basis is difficult to say at this point. Backlogs have normalized. We're not really a backlog-driven company. We're now back to two to three weeks of backlog at the enterprise level. And then the last point I'll make is we're still seeing meaningful impact from our customers and channel partners reducing their levels of inventory. So if you think about at the enterprise level, that was a point to 1.5 points of organic growth drag. So just to maybe normalize the Q3 results a little bit on the top line. So 2% on an equal days basis, and then you factor in the inventory adjustments, you're back at 3, 3.5 just to kind of put things in context a little bit. But there's no question that the activity slowed down a little bit on the welding side here in the third quarter. Well, so we haven't even rolled up our plans yet for next year. That really happens at the end of this month, and then we'll have some good discussions with our segments and we'll get a much better handle on what the price/cost equation might look like. I do think if you just look at the margin recovery trajectory that we're on. We haven't fully recovered the margin impact. And so I think it's not unreasonable to assume that there will be some carryover into maybe the first half of next year. And then you add on top of that maybe our normal pricing. But again, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. We'll give you a lot more detail when we give you guidance for the full year, which will be early next year. But certainly, if you're -- price is holding at current levels and the raw material cost -- direct material cost equation, those has stabilized. We're not seeing significant deflation at this point, but we're also not seeing anything close to the inflation that we've seen over the last two years. So, that's kind of the good news here. Yes. So, Julian, we don't give quarterly guidance. But I think if you look at historical information, you'll see that there's typically a ramp-up in Test & Measurement and Electronics in Q4 relative to Q3. And so we do expect some of that. I think overall, on the Electronics side, like I said, the consumer electronics end market remains soft. Just semi in isolation is down 20%, 25% on a year-over-year basis. And that's -- last year, that was about a $500 million segment. So, we're definitely seeing -- that's what's driving these results. If you take out the semi impact in Test & Measurement and Electronics we're actually up 2% on a year-over-year basis. But we expect this pressure to continue. We're not counting on a recovery here in the fourth quarter. It's based on run rate and typical seasonality I'd say on MTS overall, maybe, Chris, do you want to make some comments? You were just up there. So, maybe you want to-- Yes. And I would just add maybe to quantify what Chris is talking about in the short term. This business grew double-digit top line in the third quarter. And you'll recall maybe margins coming in were somewhere around 7%. And through the implementation of the business model, at this point, we are -- the outlook for the full year is in the mid-teens. So right on track in terms of the potential that we thought we had when we acquired the business. So good progress. Yes. Maybe I'll start and then, Chris, you can jump in. I think I'll start by saying we completely disagree with the premise that we are not gaining market share. Recognizing that it may be difficult for you looking in from the outside to decipher those market share gains on an annual basis, but if you go to every one of our divisions, they will have a very clear picture, all 84 of them in terms of what market growth is and what their growth rate is and what their competitors are growing at. And in all cases, we would say that given our competitive advantages that we derive from the business model in terms of our customer-facing metrics, in terms of our -- the value add that our customers are getting from buying our products, we're continuing to gain share in the markets that we're focused on. And in some cases, you're able to look at public company peers you can peel back the onion a little bit. And if you do that work -- if you were to do that work, Julian you'll see that we are gaining market share in the areas that we are focused on. And I might just add, not only are we gaining market share, but I'll just note the margin performance of our businesses relative to our competitors which typically we are running at two, three times, our competitors, and you can look at Food Equipment and Lincoln and the Welding side, for example, and you'll see that, that is the case. But maybe, Chris, if you want to comment a little bit? Yes. So again, Mig, you're right. This is on the residential renovation remodel side of things. So these are typically sales through big box retailers, names that you'd be familiar with. And I think if you look at I think somebody asked earlier about market share, this is a great example of really strong market share gains in this particular end market, because I agree with you, if you just look at the underlying data, you might be a little surprised that, that part of the business is up 7% year-over-year in the current interest rate environment. And like I said, this is essentially all volume and share gain through the big box retailers. Well, I think that overall construction in North America actually remains fairly stable. I'd say maybe a little bit more concern on the international side, which has been weak. The market demand has been a lot softer on the international side. But North America \u2013 keep in mind that in the fourth quarter, typically, we talked about seasonality by segment, I said Test & Measurement usually does better. Construction is one where, for obvious reasons, the fourth quarter is typically a little bit lower than the third quarter. But in terms of the share gains and our \u2013 the strength in this particular part of the business, that absolutely has staying power. So Mig, just from a lead time perspective, I would say that a natural outcome of our business model is best-in-class lead times and customer-facing performance. And we are very much back to where we were pre-pandemic in terms of our ability to supply our customers. In terms of the channel, yes, I think it's an area where there is a little bit of inventory in the channel. We're seeing that coming down. It's probably still out there. It's one of the segments that has been impacted, I think, by channel inventory likely to come down over the next couple of quarters here, but it's fair for sure. Right. Thank you. I'd say this is trending right in line with expectations that we kind of laid out on the last call. Like I said, the drag on the organic growth rate of 1% to 1.5% was pretty broad-based, every segment had some impact, very similar Q3 as Q2, and we think this will probably be with us for a few more quarters. And I'd just say, if you just look at our own inventory levels, we are currently running slightly above three months on hand, where typically we're running at low-twos. And we estimate that in our case, it will take us probably until kind of early mid next year to get back to normal inventory levels as we work through the exact same things that our customers and channel partners are working through. And I might just add here that that's obviously going to continue to drive some really strong free cash flow performance for ITW as inventory levels, working capital continues to normalize, as a result of supply chain having stabilized. I think it's really hard to tell. I mean, I think overall, the demand environment, as we said there's, clearly some uncertainties here in the near-term. Inventory as part of that, the interest rate environment, everybody being maybe a little bit more cautious on the CapEx side and then in of our segments, particularly, the auto strike. So there's, a lot of things going on here. It is a pretty dynamic environment, it can change pretty quickly. The only thing we know for sure is that, the ITW team will continue to read and react to whatever conditions are on the ground. And I think if you just look at our track record, we'll continue to deliver differentiated long-term performance. And so that's really our focus is on continuing to do just that. Thank you."

            "name": "Christopher O'Herlihy",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. First, I want to thank Scott and our Board of Directors for their trust and confidence in electing me as ITW's next CEO. I'm incredibly humbled by the opportunity to lead this great company, our exceptionally talented leadership team and our 46,000 dedicated colleagues around the world. As Scott said, as a result of the work done over the last 11 years in executing our enterprise strategy to leverage the ITW business model to its full potential, our company has never performed better or been better positioned for the future. The central focus of the next phase of our enterprise strategy is to elevate high quality organic growth and customer back innovation as key ITW differentiators on par with our best-in-class operational capabilities and financial performance. Our leadership team and I are deeply committed to doing just that in delivering on ITW's 2030 Enterprise Performance Goals. Now, let's turn to our Q3 performance. The strength and resilience of ITW's proprietary business model and high-quality diversified portfolio once again drove strong operational execution and financial performance this quarter. Starting with the top line, organic growth was 2% on an equal days basis, as demand for CapEx slowed down in test and measurement and electronics and welding. Our margin and income performance continues to be very robust. Operating margin improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 26.5% as enterprise initiatives contributed 140 basis points. Quarterly operating income grew 9% to $1.1 billion. GAAP EPS grew 9% to $2.55 and free cash flow was up 40%. With three quarters behind us, we are narrowing our EPS guidance to a range of $9.65 to $9.85, which now incorporates a $0.12 adjustment to the impact of the auto strike in Q4. Looking ahead at the balance of the year, the company remains well positioned to deliver another year of differentiated performance. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q3 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael. Yes. So Scott, I would say, in general, our plan is very much in line with what we outlined at our Investor Day in terms of really ensuring that we continue to strengthen our foundation, which is our business model and obviously then building organic growth as a core strength on par with our operational capabilities and financial performance over time. I think the first 90 days I'm just learning the job, just go out and pretty good understanding of our businesses already, but obviously, working with our businesses to make sure that our strategy is well part of dominant businesses, which, of course, it is, that's really the plan for the first 90 days, I would say. But it's really in the context of being very committed to this -- the strategy for the next phase, which is to sustain the strong foundation we have around our business model, we're really leaning in and continuing to build our organic growth capabilities to be on par with our operational capabilities and our financial performance. Yes. So, I would say, Julian, that certainly the assumptions we made when we acquired the MTS business in terms of strategic fit and financial rationale have been very much validated by our two years of owning the business. The business has performed very well. We are currently in the process of implementing our business model. We're already starting to see some real nice results accruing from that. But we strongly feel this is going to be a very, very successful ITW acquisition. In fact, we are taking our Board of Directors up to MTS later this week for them to witness firsthand the level of progress that we've made on the integration in terms of implementing our business model. But like I say, two years in, so far so good. Great people, great brands, great technology, great opportunity to improve the business model, and like I said, this is going to be a great ITW business in the long term. Yes, I would echo everything Michael just said in terms of the quality of our portfolio, in terms of the amount of room we have to grow in each segment customer-facing performance and so on and the focused investments that we've made in areas like sales and innovation, coupled with the fact that we've seen a nicely improving yield on customer-back innovation. All this gives the credence to what we're hearing from our businesses that we are getting share in most of our key markets in relation to our competition. Yes. And then just on the backlog, we're back to normal levels which, in our case, given our customer delivery performance is two to three weeks. So we're back to kind of normal levels here."

            "content": "Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you are all aware, on September 7, we announced our CEO succession plan, wherein I will be turning over the CEO role to my colleague, Chris O'Herlihy at year-end. Chris is an exceptional leader with deep expertise in ITW's highly differentiated business model, our focused strategy to leverage it to full potential and the company's unique one-of-a-kind culture. He has been an invaluable partner and collaborator with me over the past 11 years. We have worked closely together to prepare for this transition. He is more than ready and he will do an exceptional job as ITW's next CEO. If you allow me a brief bit of reflection in the last 11 years, I will simply say that everything we did was driven by our fundamental belief in the performance power of the differentiated set of strategic and operational capabilities and practices that we refer to as the ITW business model. In this past phase, we focused on getting the company properly positioned to be able to leverage them to their full potential over the long term. With this as our foundation, ITW enters our next phase in a position of great strength and resilience with these unique skills and capabilities sharply honed. I wholeheartedly believe that there will be an even bigger source of competitive advantage and differentiated performance in the company's next phase than they were in the last one, especially if you believe as I do that the level of volatility and unpredictability of the world will only increase from here forward. I have absolutely no doubt that Chris and the incredibly talented ITW leadership team behind him will utilize all of the differentiated tools at ITW's disposal to read and react to whatever comes our way and lead the company to even greater heights in our next phase. Let me close by saying that it has been both a privilege and an honor to lead this great company for the last 11 years. And I offer my deepest gratitude to all of my ITW colleagues past and present for all of their support and for their unwavering commitment to working every day to be the best ITW that we can be. With that, it is now my pleasure to turn the call and in a few months, the company over to Chris O'Herlihy. Chris, over to you. Good morning. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to ITW\u2019s second quarter 2023 conference call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll discuss ITW\u2019s second quarter financial results and provide an update on our full year 2023 outlook. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, the ITW team delivered another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. Quarterly operating income grew 9% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in ITW\u2019s history. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points year-on-year to 24.8%, a second quarter record with a 130 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. Operating margins for the company are now solidly above 2019 levels. And with a normalizing price/cost environment, we are back to making progress toward our 2030 goal of 30%. With regard to revenues, organic growth was 3% as stable underlying demand in many of ITW\u2019s industrial end markets was partially offset by inventory reductions at our end customers and channel partners in response to stabilizing supply chain performance. We estimate that this impacted organic growth by 1 point to 1.5 points in the quarter. GAAP EPS of $2.48 was also a Q2 record for the company and excluding one-off tax items in both years, grew \u2013 EPS grew 9%. Looking ahead, while customer and channel inventory normalization will continue to be a factor for the next several quarters at least, we expect stable underlying demand and continued strong margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q2 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Q2 revenue grew by 2% with organic growth of 3%, and divestitures reduced revenue by 1%. Foreign currency translation impact was neutral and not a headwind for the first time since the third quarter of 2021. Underlying demand remains stable across the majority of our end markets with some softness in about 25% of our portfolio. As Scott mentioned, our businesses estimate that inventory reduction efforts by our end customers and channel partners reduced organic growth by 1% to 1.5% at the enterprise level. By geography, North America was flat, Europe grew 5%, Asia Pacific grew 11%, with China up 22%. On the bottom line, operating income grew 9%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time ever. Operating margins were a real highlight this quarter as they improved to a new Q2 record of 24.8% with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 130 basis points. Price/cost margin impact contributed 260 basis points in Q2, while higher wages and benefit costs lowered margins by around 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to fund our growth investments, including headcount additions to support our organic growth strategies and initiatives. All in, we delivered 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter, with margin expansion in six of our seven segments, three of them, welding, food equipment and construction products, recorded all-time highs. GAAP EPS was $2.48, an increase of 5%, and excluding one-time tax items in both years, EPS grew 9%. Our cash performance was strong as free cash flow grew 68% to $705 million, a new Q2 record. Free cash flow was 94% of net income, about 10 percentage points above our historical Q2 average, helped by an inventory reduction of 6% since year-end. Like our end customers and channel partners, our divisions are also beginning to reduce inventory levels as supply chains normalize. That being said, we added almost $1 billion of inventory over the last two years to mitigate supply chain challenges and it would likely take us until the first half of next year to get our inventory levels from currently 3.2 months on hand back to our normal months on hand levels of about two. We expect that it will be much the same for many of our channel partners and customers. Overall, for Q2, excellent operational execution and financial performance across the board, including record operating income, operating margin and GAAP EPS. Turning to Slide 4. We wanted to spend a minute on ITW\u2019s operating margin performance in Q2. Like I said, one of the highlights of the quarter. Not only did margins significantly expand year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but at 24.8% margins and are now also solidly above pre-pandemic levels, and we are back on track in terms of making progress towards our goal of 30% in 2030. Let\u2019s move to the segment results, starting with automotive OEM, which led the segments with strong organic growth of 16% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 3% and Europe grew 18%. China grew 51%. Operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 16.8%, and price/cost margin impact turned positive for the first time in more than three years as this segment continues on the margin recovery and improvement path that we laid out at our 2023 Investor Day. As a reminder, we\u2019re executing a plan to get auto OEM margins solidly back into the 20s over the next three years. Organic growth in this segment in the second half reflects some tougher comparisons, and we expect continued meaningful sequential improvement in operating margins in Q3 and Q4. Turning to Slide 5. Food equipment also delivered strong organic growth of 7% with North America up 8%. Institutional end markets were up 13%, with continued strength across the board. International revenue grew 5%, with Europe up 5% and Asia Pacific up 2%. A real highlight was service revenue, which grew 16%, the ninth quarter in a row with double-digit growth as we continue to support existing customers, new product installations and gain market share. Operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 27.8%, an all-time record for the food equipment segment. Test and measurement and electronics delivered positive organic growth of 1%. The slowdown in semiconductor-related revenues, which represent about 20% of the segment, reduced the segment growth rate by 6 percentage points. Test and measurement grew 10% with continued strong demand for capital equipment as evidenced, for example, by Instron, which grew 30%. Electronics declined 13% on semiconductor softness, which is, however, beginning to show some signs of bottoming out. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered 1% organic growth against a tough comparison of plus 22% in the prior year. Equipment revenue was essentially flat and consumables were up 2%. Industrial sales were really solid with organic growth of plus 5% on top of 27% in the prior year, while the commercial side was down 9%, about as expected against the comparison of 19% last year. North America revenue was flat and international grew 5%. This quarter\u2019s highlight was definitely operating margin expansion of 460 basis points to 33.9%, a new record for the segment and for the company. And the fact that our highest margin segment continues to improve margins and not just by a little bit, is a good example of the never satisfied continuous improvement mindset and is so core to the ITW culture and mindset across the company. Polymers and fluids organic revenue was down 1% against a difficult comparison of plus 10% last year. Divestitures impacted revenue by 6%. Automotive aftermarket was up 1%, polymers down 2% and fluids down 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international declined 3%. Turning to Slide 7. Organic revenue in construction was down 6% against a comparison of plus 15% last year. North America was down 3% with U.S. residential construction down 2% and commercial construction, which represents about 15% of the region, down 5%. Europe was down 14%, and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. Despite some challenging end market conditions, operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 29.3%, an all-time record for the Construction Products segment. Finally, Specialty organic revenue was down 4%, which included 1 point of headwind from product line simplification and an estimated 3 percentage points from end customer and channel inventory reduction efforts. North America was down 7% and international grew 4%. Equipment revenue, which represents about 20% of the segment, was up 23%, and consumables were down 9%. With that, let\u2019s move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. As you saw this morning, we raised our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 with a new midpoint of $9.75 based on our strong first half performance with record first half GAAP EPS of $4.81 and the expectation for stable underlying demand and continued strong margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year.  Our organic growth guidance of 3% to 5% includes our expectation that end customer and channel inventory normalization activities will continue to modestly impact overall demand through at least the balance of the year. Operating margin is projected to expand by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes a contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We\u2019re also projecting strong free cash flow performance with a conversion of over 100% of net income. Finally, on the tax rate, our first half rate was 22%, and we expect our typical 24% in the second half for an expected full year rate of around 23%. In summary, a strong first half, both operationally and financially. And as we head into the second half, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver differentiated performance through the balance of the year. With that, Karen, I will turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: All right. Thank you, Michael. Rob, can you please open up the lines for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Hello everyone.\nScott Santi: Hello Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes hi, thank you. I wonder if we could address Michael, just kind of the price-cost algorithm for the remainder of the year now. You are up 260 bps in the Q2. I know you still got some more work to do there, particularly in Automotive. So maybe you could address that on a total ITW basis? And how do you see Automotive margins progressing into the back half of the year towards that two handle on margins there?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, sure, Jeff. So I think overall, on price-cost, we\u2019d say we\u2019re on track to recover the margin impact from a period over the last two years of unprecedented inflation, which has now stabilized. So, in the first quarter, price-cost was positive 190 basis points, Q2 260 basis points and for the balance of the year, we\u2019re looking at a more normalized 130 to 150 basis points range. And for the full year, we should recover somewhere around 150 to 200 basis points at the enterprise level. I think what was encouraging is every segment is now margin positive, including Automotive OEM and we expect that for [indiscernible] your question specifically to remain the case for the back half of the year. And combined with enterprise initiatives, we expect sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 in the Automotive segment, and we should end up somewhere in the high teens as we exit 2023. We\u2019re still a long way to go over the next two to three years to get back to kind of the low to mid-20s, which is the path that we laid out at Investor Day.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And your comments about the supply chain normalization and everything were pretty clear, but I just wonder if you could give us some perspective on your backlogs, right? Typically, you don\u2019t have big backlogs, but you got to kind of 2x normal in a number of your businesses. Where are we at the ITW level and kind of getting things back to the normal run rate?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think, similar to what we talked about on the last call, supply chain performance continues to improve. And as that happened, our backlogs are also starting to come down. And at this point, we\u2019re still above our normal levels. If you look at the businesses where we do carry some backlog Food Equipment, for example, we\u2019re running at 2x normal levels, and the same is true in Welding. But as I said, those backlogs are coming down pretty quickly as supply chain performance improves.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you very much.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook : Hi, good morning. Two questions. A follow-up on the inventory reductions from your customers and channel partners. Exactly what\u2019s embedded in the back half of the year, is it another visit 1 to 1.5 points and in the guide in the back half of the year? And then as a follow-up to that, you are maintaining your revenue guide despite this, so what\u2019s doing better than expectations? And sort of my last question is Construction margins were very impressive considering the sales decline. So any color on that? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think the inventory reduction impact that we saw here in Q2 is now embedded in our run rates, and therefore, embedded in our guidance for the balance of the year. Actually, if you look at our Q2, it came in right in line with run rate except for these \u2013 the inventory impact that we estimate at 1 point to 1.5 points. And underlying demand, as we said, is really stable, if not strong in places like Auto and Food Equipment. So we feel really good about our assumptions here going into the back half of the year. Your question specifically on Construction, I agree with you, that\u2019s some pretty impressive performance given the challenging end markets, particularly if you look at Europe. The big drivers here continue to be enterprise initiatives, which has been called the gift that keeps on giving.\nScott Santi: By you.\nMichael Larsen: By me.\nScott Santi: Yes.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, if I may say so. And I think total company, the Enterprise initiative impact ranged from 70 to 200 basis points by segment with Construction at the very high end of that at about 200 basis points impact. And then certainly, there\u2019s still some catch-up on price/cost. Construction was a segment that was hit harder than the average in 2021 and 2022. And so price/cost did contribute in a meaningful way. We do expect that, just like we do for the rest of the Enterprise to begin to normalize here in the back half, like I said in response to Jeff\u2019s question, but we\u2019re still going to see positive price/cost impact, including Construction in the second half.\nJamie Cook : Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe O\u2019Dea : Hi, good morning. \nScott Santi: Good morning.\nJoe O\u2019Dea : I guess I wanted to sort of extend that a little bit in terms of the comment around underlying demand being sort of stable to strong and sort of calling out Auto and Food Equipment. But anything from sort of a regional or end market perspective that you\u2019re watching most closely on end market demand and sort of considerations on kind of prospects for slowing anymore?\nScott Santi: I think overall, it\u2019s been remarkably stable. If anything, we saw some firming up in the second quarter based on some trends in the first quarter that we talked about relative to 25% of our portfolio. I think the one place we saw things continue to weaken was in Europe on Construction between Q1 and Q2, but for the rest of the portfolio, I think, at this point, the best description is pretty firm.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Got it. And then also just the margin strength in the quarter and thinking about the back half of this year, I think, the midpoint for the full year would suggest something like a 25.5% margin in the back half. I think you\u2019ve talked about sort of continued progress on Auto. Just anything else that you think to be the more notable contributors to that sequential improvement?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I mean the big driver continues to be the Enterprise initiatives. The work around eighty-twenty front-to-back and strategic sourcing efforts, we expect at least 100 basis points of contribution there in the second half. And then price-cost, we still expect a meaningful contribution as we talked about a few minutes ago. So, all of that means that as we look at kind of the second half, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4, maybe somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points each quarter of sequential improvement. I think we talked in the past about 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. That\u2019s still looking very good. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re really well positioned here in terms of our margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year and frankly into next year. So, I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. \nScott Santi: Good morning.\nTami Zakaria: Thank you so much for taking my questions. So, my first question is on Food Equipment. I think I saw on your slide, it grew 3%, while services were up 15%. So for the Equipment portion, is that entirely pricing-driven? Was there any volume growth in the quarter on the Equipment side?\nMichael Larsen: So, I think you know this, Tami, we don\u2019t break out price and volume. And I\u2019d say both elements contributed and it\u2019s a little different equipment versus service, but certainly some really strong activity. North America, I think, we said up 8%, that has Equipment up 5%, services up 15%, by end market institutions up 13%, health care up 18%, restaurants, still really strong performance there. Retail a little softer. That can be a little lumpy, international side, up 5%. So, I think really strong quarter by Food Equipment and actually looking really good for Q3. I think that they should be putting up another really strong quarter. There might be a little bit of \u2013 if you go back and look, the comparisons are a little bit challenging on a year-over-year basis. But overall, the underlying demand in food equipment remains really healthy and really well positioned again for the second half.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful color. And if I can ask a follow-up about your Welding segment, I thought the results there were very interesting. Operating margin was up 460 basis points even though organic growth was about 1%. So, what\u2019s driving this very strong operating margin leverage? Is it purely price/cost, or is there something else going on in there?\nMichael Larsen: There is something else going on in there, Tami. So, it\u2019s a similar answer to what I said for Construction. I mean I think there is a healthy dose of enterprise initiatives. And then we\u2019re still recovering the margin impact on price/cost. So, those are the main drivers here. And like I said, I mean, price/cost, we expect that to normalize in the second half, but the Enterprise initiatives and we expect that to continue into the \u2013 through the balance of the year and into next year.\nTami Zakaria: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning everyone. \nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So you mentioned you thought electronics-related markets look like they may be bottoming out. Could you give us more color into what you\u2019re seeing here prompted you to say that? And then stepping back and focusing on the 25% of the business, including Electronics, that has been weak, would you say that like Electronics, you are seeing the bottoming in many of these markets, maybe outside of European Construction, which you already mentioned? Or was that [indiscernible] just focused on Electronics?\nMichael Larsen: So let me do the semi portion first. I mean, I think, there has been this view that the second half would be a step-up from the first half. Really, we talked about this going into the year.\nScott Santi: Mostly from what we\u2019re hearing from our customers.\nMichael Larsen: And I was going to say, the customer feedback has now become even more supportive of that view along the lines of get ready for orders to come back here in the second half and make sure you have the capacity to support us, which, of course, we do. So, that\u2019s kind of the color commentary around semi. And similar to what you\u2019re hearing from other...\nScott Santi: We\u2019re not baking any of that into our back half\u2026\nMichael Larsen: That\u2019s a good point. None of that is baked in. So I think that\u2019s...\nScott Santi: We\u2019ll take them when we see it.\nMichael Larsen: Exactly like we normally do; none of that would be in our run rates, obviously. And so we\u2019d be happy to see that here late Q3, Q4, if we get those \u2013 if that really comes to fruition. On the 25% of the portfolio, I think maybe to give you a little bit more detail, I think what was really encouraging this quarter is if you look at the performance of those businesses, and there are some puts and takes. There are some businesses that are no longer slowing, that have moved out and others, I think Construction Europe was an example that maybe have moved in, but it\u2019s still about 25% of the company. Those businesses were down 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, and they were only down 3% in the second quarter. And actually, if you look at it sequentially, the businesses as a group improved 2% sequentially. And that includes in that 25% is also at least a portion of our semi revenues. So I think that\u2019s certainly encouraging as we look to the back half of the year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Michael, that\u2019s really helpful. And then I just want to go back to your commentary on regional demand. You mentioned China was up 22% in the quarter, which I think you expect did. And obviously several of your peers have talked about seeing some incremental weakness in China moving forward. Do you still feel well positioned there, maybe given your China auto exposure, you still expecting kind of Food Equipment markets to improve? Any color would be helpful.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think, Andy, the big driver for us in China is auto, and that\u2019s our largest businesses. We talked about this on the last call, we expected a strong Q2 in China. Based on some of the COVID-related slowing in the first quarter, we bounced back in the second quarter with auto up more than 50% in Q2 and all of China up 22%. I think a better way to look at China is maybe if you look at the first half, our China business was up 7% on a year-over-year basis, and that\u2019s maybe a more accurate representation of kind of the underlying levels of demand. And so for the second half, we\u2019d expect something kind of in the mid-single digits out of that region. But again, it\u2019s all driven by the auto business that\u2019s doing a phenomenal job frankly, gaining share and launching new products particularly on the EV side with domestic local Chinese OEMs that are winning big time, as we talked about at Investor Day. So really well positioned, not just for the second half but for many, many years to come here in our China business and in auto particularly.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Appreciate all the color.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey guys. Good morning.\nScott Santi: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Can we maybe just double-click a little bit on the longer-term service opportunity in Food Equipment? Clearly, 16% growth in that business is very robust, and I\u2019m sure it carries a pretty good margin for you guys as well. Can you just maybe kind of talk a little bit about how you\u2019re increasing the growth rate today and then what the expectations are going forward?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean I think the service business we\u2019ve talked about this for a long-time now in terms of long-term organic growth potential. It is a huge differentiator with us \u2013 for us in the market. We are the only OEM that has service capabilities, and it gives us all kinds of advantages in terms of our ability to install, service, maintain and then capture replacement down the line. So we think there\u2019s a lot more to come on the service side. We\u2019re obviously still, to some extent recovering from COVID. If you actually look at the Equipment side has now fully recovered to 2019 levels. The Service side is still catching up, and so we expect that there\u2019s still a lot of runway particularly with our installed base.\nScott Santi: I was going to say that I\u2019m not current on the exact \u2013 what our businesses estimate is our share of our installed base, but last time I had the conversation I think it was sort of well into the low-20s at best maybe and don\u2019t sort of take that as possible, but at the point is that we have a lot of room to grow within \u2013 with just doing \u2013 giving more penetration with our current installed base globally.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an opportunity to elaborate on that point, Scott. I think you guys called out the service business being roughly, what 30% of the Food Equipment segment. So are you \u2013 do you have to invest more in your service capabilities or getting feed on the street to improve the penetration there?\nScott Santi: Yes. And that\u2019s been an active strategy for the last \u2013 really coming \u2013 really from before COVID. So some of it is coverage, some of it is programming. When you actually service the equipment you sell, we have lots of opportunity to integrate service offerings at the point we sell the equipment, which is part of the \u2013 why we think this is a big competitive advantage for us. So it\u2019s essentially all of the above, but there\u2019s no way to do service remotely. So we got to have service techs on the street. We\u2019ve got, I think, north of 1,500 in North America and the same in Europe. And given the profitability of the business and how much runway we have we\u2019ll certainly continue to invest. That\u2019s part of what Michael talked about; continue to invest in our organic growth strategies that\u2019s certainly a good example.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. Okay. Great. And then maybe one last question just on M&A. Just any comments around the pipeline today, what you\u2019re seeing and whether there\u2019s been any movement since you last updated at Investor Day?\nScott Santi: Yes, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s been no change. We continue to get sort of apple flow in terms of people wanting us to take a look at things. And as we\u2019ve talked about for a long time and certainly updated at our Investor Day, the aperture through which we will strike on those opportunities is pretty narrow given all the potential in our core business, but we\u2019ve done MTS recently, and we will continue to opportunistically be aggressive. But from the standpoint of overall flow, is it up or down, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been pretty stable.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question first off, just around the cadence of sort of Q3 versus Q4; anything to call out there when you\u2019re thinking about margins or the top line, particularly in the context of that destocking that you mentioned? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think, Julian, I think I said this earlier, we do expect as we typically do, if you look at our historical sequential lift from Q2 to Q3 of about 1%. The thing to keep in mind is that Q3 has one less shipping day relative to prior year and relative to Q2, so that is going to have a little bit of an impact. So don\u2019t expect a big jump here in Q3. But certainly based on current run rates, some progress on the top line, progress on the bottom line with margin expansion. I think we talked about that somewhere along the lines of 50 plus basis points from Q2 to Q3. And I might just add that in terms of our typical cadence kind of first half, second half, if you look at our full year EPS, we\u2019re typically 49% to 51%, and we are \u2013 as we see today, right in line with that, based on our \u2013 if you look at our $4.81 GAAP EPS for the first half the midpoint of our guidance of $9.75, you can calculate what\u2019s left to go, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s a lift from the first half to the second half. That\u2019s right in line with our historical averages, which gives us a lot of confidence as we head into the second half here.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much, Michael. And maybe just my second question or follow-up would just be around when you\u2019re thinking about the sort of market share gain efforts across the company. Volume growth year-to-date very muted or negative; do you still think you\u2019re getting some share? Or was the sort of the share gain maximized really two, three years ago when competitors were supply constrained and now we\u2019re in a normal supply chain environment, the sort of share gains have dried up largely? Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Well, so Julian, I wouldn\u2019t agree with how you characterize this in terms of no volume gains year-to-date. I think we have a lot of confidence that we continue to take market share not just as we talked about through the pandemic. But on an ongoing basis, I mean, I think if you look at our organic growth rates relative to peers in these \u2013 in some of these segments, you\u2019ve got some good comps. You can certainly take a look at that. And I think we\u2019re continuing to invest here in all of our organic growth strategies and efforts, including headcount to continue to take market share. So we have a high degree of confidence that we continue to take share.\nScott Santi: And it\u2019s not something you measure in a quarter or two.\nJulian Mitchell: No, I think these...\nScott Santi: I think the long view, we\u2019ve committed to organic growth in our organic growth goals in our \u2013 in the Investor Day we just did, and those are organic growth goals that are going to be well above underlying market growth at 4 to 5 and in that case by definition we will continue to take share.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. And I think the other thing, I mean, the biggest driver as we talked about at Investor Day, Julian, I think you were there is going to be our customer-back innovation efforts. We\u2019re signing a bright light on our CBI efforts, and we\u2019re \u2013 the whole company is focused on continuing to drive up the contribution to organic growth from our innovation efforts. And so you put all of that together we\u2019re highly confident we can deliver our long-term kind of 4% plus organic, which is given our high levels of profitability, that\u2019s all we need to grow, EPS kind of high-single digit, low-double digit. You add an attractive dividend yield on top of that, and you\u2019re getting that 11 to 13 TSR over the long-term, not every year, this year, yes, but not every year. That\u2019s what you should expect from ITW. And it\u2019s much more about that than it is a quarterly market share number, which is, I think, what you\u2019re asking about.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Sure. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. All lines may now disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Q2 revenue grew by 2% with organic growth of 3%, and divestitures reduced revenue by 1%. Foreign currency translation impact was neutral and not a headwind for the first time since the third quarter of 2021. Underlying demand remains stable across the majority of our end markets with some softness in about 25% of our portfolio. As Scott mentioned, our businesses estimate that inventory reduction efforts by our end customers and channel partners reduced organic growth by 1% to 1.5% at the enterprise level. By geography, North America was flat, Europe grew 5%, Asia Pacific grew 11%, with China up 22%. On the bottom line, operating income grew 9%, exceeding $1 billion for the first time ever. Operating margins were a real highlight this quarter as they improved to a new Q2 record of 24.8% with Enterprise Initiatives contributing 130 basis points. Price/cost margin impact contributed 260 basis points in Q2, while higher wages and benefit costs lowered margins by around 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to fund our growth investments, including headcount additions to support our organic growth strategies and initiatives. All in, we delivered 170 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter, with margin expansion in six of our seven segments, three of them, welding, food equipment and construction products, recorded all-time highs. GAAP EPS was $2.48, an increase of 5%, and excluding one-time tax items in both years, EPS grew 9%. Our cash performance was strong as free cash flow grew 68% to $705 million, a new Q2 record. Free cash flow was 94% of net income, about 10 percentage points above our historical Q2 average, helped by an inventory reduction of 6% since year-end. Like our end customers and channel partners, our divisions are also beginning to reduce inventory levels as supply chains normalize. That being said, we added almost $1 billion of inventory over the last two years to mitigate supply chain challenges and it would likely take us until the first half of next year to get our inventory levels from currently 3.2 months on hand back to our normal months on hand levels of about two. We expect that it will be much the same for many of our channel partners and customers. Overall, for Q2, excellent operational execution and financial performance across the board, including record operating income, operating margin and GAAP EPS. Turning to Slide 4. We wanted to spend a minute on ITW's operating margin performance in Q2. Like I said, one of the highlights of the quarter. Not only did margins significantly expand year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, but at 24.8% margins and are now also solidly above pre-pandemic levels, and we are back on track in terms of making progress towards our goal of 30% in 2030. Let's move to the segment results, starting with automotive OEM, which led the segments with strong organic growth of 16% and positive growth in all regions. North America was up 3% and Europe grew 18%. China grew 51%. Operating margin expanded 250 basis points to 16.8%, and price/cost margin impact turned positive for the first time in more than three years as this segment continues on the margin recovery and improvement path that we laid out at our 2023 Investor Day. As a reminder, we're executing a plan to get auto OEM margins solidly back into the 20s over the next three years. Organic growth in this segment in the second half reflects some tougher comparisons, and we expect continued meaningful sequential improvement in operating margins in Q3 and Q4. Turning to Slide 5. Food equipment also delivered strong organic growth of 7% with North America up 8%. Institutional end markets were up 13%, with continued strength across the board. International revenue grew 5%, with Europe up 5% and Asia Pacific up 2%. A real highlight was service revenue, which grew 16%, the ninth quarter in a row with double-digit growth as we continue to support existing customers, new product installations and gain market share. Operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 27.8%, an all-time record for the food equipment segment. Test and measurement and electronics delivered positive organic growth of 1%. The slowdown in semiconductor-related revenues, which represent about 20% of the segment, reduced the segment growth rate by 6 percentage points. Test and measurement grew 10% with continued strong demand for capital equipment as evidenced, for example, by Instron, which grew 30%. Electronics declined 13% on semiconductor softness, which is, however, beginning to show some signs of bottoming out. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered 1% organic growth against a tough comparison of plus 22% in the prior year. Equipment revenue was essentially flat and consumables were up 2%. Industrial sales were really solid with organic growth of plus 5% on top of 27% in the prior year, while the commercial side was down 9%, about as expected against the comparison of 19% last year. North America revenue was flat and international grew 5%. This quarter's highlight was definitely operating margin expansion of 460 basis points to 33.9%, a new record for the segment and for the company. And the fact that our highest margin segment continues to improve margins and not just by a little bit, is a good example of the never satisfied continuous improvement mindset and is so core to the ITW culture and mindset across the company. Polymers and fluids organic revenue was down 1% against a difficult comparison of plus 10% last year. Divestitures impacted revenue by 6%. Automotive aftermarket was up 1%, polymers down 2% and fluids down 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international declined 3%. Turning to Slide 7. Organic revenue in construction was down 6% against a comparison of plus 15% last year. North America was down 3% with U.S. residential construction down 2% and commercial construction, which represents about 15% of the region, down 5%. Europe was down 14%, and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. Despite some challenging end market conditions, operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 29.3%, an all-time record for the Construction Products segment. Finally, Specialty organic revenue was down 4%, which included 1 point of headwind from product line simplification and an estimated 3 percentage points from end customer and channel inventory reduction efforts. North America was down 7% and international grew 4%. Equipment revenue, which represents about 20% of the segment, was up 23%, and consumables were down 9%. With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. As you saw this morning, we raised our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 with a new midpoint of $9.75 based on our strong first half performance with record first half GAAP EPS of $4.81 and the expectation for stable underlying demand and continued strong margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year.  Our organic growth guidance of 3% to 5% includes our expectation that end customer and channel inventory normalization activities will continue to modestly impact overall demand through at least the balance of the year. Operating margin is projected to expand by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range of 24.5% to 25.5%, which includes a contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. We're also projecting strong free cash flow performance with a conversion of over 100% of net income. Finally, on the tax rate, our first half rate was 22%, and we expect our typical 24% in the second half for an expected full year rate of around 23%. In summary, a strong first half, both operationally and financially. And as we head into the second half, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver differentiated performance through the balance of the year. With that, Karen, I will turn it back to you. Yes, sure, Jeff. So I think overall, on price-cost, we'd say we're on track to recover the margin impact from a period over the last two years of unprecedented inflation, which has now stabilized. So, in the first quarter, price-cost was positive 190 basis points, Q2 260 basis points and for the balance of the year, we're looking at a more normalized 130 to 150 basis points range. And for the full year, we should recover somewhere around 150 to 200 basis points at the enterprise level. I think what was encouraging is every segment is now margin positive, including Automotive OEM and we expect that for [indiscernible] your question specifically to remain the case for the back half of the year. And combined with enterprise initiatives, we expect sequential improvement in Q3 and Q4 in the Automotive segment, and we should end up somewhere in the high teens as we exit 2023. We're still a long way to go over the next two to three years to get back to kind of the low to mid-20s, which is the path that we laid out at Investor Day. Yes, I think, similar to what we talked about on the last call, supply chain performance continues to improve. And as that happened, our backlogs are also starting to come down. And at this point, we're still above our normal levels. If you look at the businesses where we do carry some backlog Food Equipment, for example, we're running at 2x normal levels, and the same is true in Welding. But as I said, those backlogs are coming down pretty quickly as supply chain performance improves. Sure. Yes. I think the inventory reduction impact that we saw here in Q2 is now embedded in our run rates, and therefore, embedded in our guidance for the balance of the year. Actually, if you look at our Q2, it came in right in line with run rate except for these \u2013 the inventory impact that we estimate at 1 point to 1.5 points. And underlying demand, as we said, is really stable, if not strong in places like Auto and Food Equipment. So we feel really good about our assumptions here going into the back half of the year. Your question specifically on Construction, I agree with you, that's some pretty impressive performance given the challenging end markets, particularly if you look at Europe. The big drivers here continue to be enterprise initiatives, which has been called the gift that keeps on giving. By me. Yes, if I may say so. And I think total company, the Enterprise initiative impact ranged from 70 to 200 basis points by segment with Construction at the very high end of that at about 200 basis points impact. And then certainly, there's still some catch-up on price/cost. Construction was a segment that was hit harder than the average in 2021 and 2022. And so price/cost did contribute in a meaningful way. We do expect that, just like we do for the rest of the Enterprise to begin to normalize here in the back half, like I said in response to Jeff's question, but we're still going to see positive price/cost impact, including Construction in the second half. Sure. Yes, I mean the big driver continues to be the Enterprise initiatives. The work around eighty-twenty front-to-back and strategic sourcing efforts, we expect at least 100 basis points of contribution there in the second half. And then price-cost, we still expect a meaningful contribution as we talked about a few minutes ago. So, all of that means that as we look at kind of the second half, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially from Q2 to Q3 and from Q3 to Q4, maybe somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points each quarter of sequential improvement. I think we talked in the past about 100 basis points of improvement year-over-year. That's still looking very good. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, we're really well positioned here in terms of our margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year and frankly into next year. So, I'll leave it at that. So, I think you know this, Tami, we don't break out price and volume. And I'd say both elements contributed and it's a little different equipment versus service, but certainly some really strong activity. North America, I think, we said up 8%, that has Equipment up 5%, services up 15%, by end market institutions up 13%, health care up 18%, restaurants, still really strong performance there. Retail a little softer. That can be a little lumpy, international side, up 5%. So, I think really strong quarter by Food Equipment and actually looking really good for Q3. I think that they should be putting up another really strong quarter. There might be a little bit of \u2013 if you go back and look, the comparisons are a little bit challenging on a year-over-year basis. But overall, the underlying demand in food equipment remains really healthy and really well positioned again for the second half. There is something else going on in there, Tami. So, it's a similar answer to what I said for Construction. I mean I think there is a healthy dose of enterprise initiatives. And then we're still recovering the margin impact on price/cost. So, those are the main drivers here. And like I said, I mean, price/cost, we expect that to normalize in the second half, but the Enterprise initiatives and we expect that to continue into the \u2013 through the balance of the year and into next year. Good morning. So let me do the semi portion first. I mean, I think, there has been this view that the second half would be a step-up from the first half. Really, we talked about this going into the year. And I was going to say, the customer feedback has now become even more supportive of that view along the lines of get ready for orders to come back here in the second half and make sure you have the capacity to support us, which, of course, we do. So, that's kind of the color commentary around semi. And similar to what you're hearing from other... That's a good point. None of that is baked in. So I think that's... Exactly like we normally do; none of that would be in our run rates, obviously. And so we'd be happy to see that here late Q3, Q4, if we get those \u2013 if that really comes to fruition. On the 25% of the portfolio, I think maybe to give you a little bit more detail, I think what was really encouraging this quarter is if you look at the performance of those businesses, and there are some puts and takes. There are some businesses that are no longer slowing, that have moved out and others, I think Construction Europe was an example that maybe have moved in, but it's still about 25% of the company. Those businesses were down 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, and they were only down 3% in the second quarter. And actually, if you look at it sequentially, the businesses as a group improved 2% sequentially. And that includes in that 25% is also at least a portion of our semi revenues. So I think that's certainly encouraging as we look to the back half of the year. Yes. I think, Andy, the big driver for us in China is auto, and that's our largest businesses. We talked about this on the last call, we expected a strong Q2 in China. Based on some of the COVID-related slowing in the first quarter, we bounced back in the second quarter with auto up more than 50% in Q2 and all of China up 22%. I think a better way to look at China is maybe if you look at the first half, our China business was up 7% on a year-over-year basis, and that's maybe a more accurate representation of kind of the underlying levels of demand. And so for the second half, we'd expect something kind of in the mid-single digits out of that region. But again, it's all driven by the auto business that's doing a phenomenal job frankly, gaining share and launching new products particularly on the EV side with domestic local Chinese OEMs that are winning big time, as we talked about at Investor Day. So really well positioned, not just for the second half but for many, many years to come here in our China business and in auto particularly. Sure. Yes. I mean I think the service business we've talked about this for a long-time now in terms of long-term organic growth potential. It is a huge differentiator with us \u2013 for us in the market. We are the only OEM that has service capabilities, and it gives us all kinds of advantages in terms of our ability to install, service, maintain and then capture replacement down the line. So we think there's a lot more to come on the service side. We're obviously still, to some extent recovering from COVID. If you actually look at the Equipment side has now fully recovered to 2019 levels. The Service side is still catching up, and so we expect that there's still a lot of runway particularly with our installed base. Yes. I think, Julian, I think I said this earlier, we do expect as we typically do, if you look at our historical sequential lift from Q2 to Q3 of about 1%. The thing to keep in mind is that Q3 has one less shipping day relative to prior year and relative to Q2, so that is going to have a little bit of an impact. So don't expect a big jump here in Q3. But certainly based on current run rates, some progress on the top line, progress on the bottom line with margin expansion. I think we talked about that somewhere along the lines of 50 plus basis points from Q2 to Q3. And I might just add that in terms of our typical cadence kind of first half, second half, if you look at our full year EPS, we're typically 49% to 51%, and we are \u2013 as we see today, right in line with that, based on our \u2013 if you look at our $4.81 GAAP EPS for the first half the midpoint of our guidance of $9.75, you can calculate what's left to go, and you'll see it's a lift from the first half to the second half. That's right in line with our historical averages, which gives us a lot of confidence as we head into the second half here. Well, so Julian, I wouldn't agree with how you characterize this in terms of no volume gains year-to-date. I think we have a lot of confidence that we continue to take market share not just as we talked about through the pandemic. But on an ongoing basis, I mean, I think if you look at our organic growth rates relative to peers in these \u2013 in some of these segments, you've got some good comps. You can certainly take a look at that. And I think we're continuing to invest here in all of our organic growth strategies and efforts, including headcount to continue to take market share. So we have a high degree of confidence that we continue to take share. Yes. And I think the other thing, I mean, the biggest driver as we talked about at Investor Day, Julian, I think you were there is going to be our customer-back innovation efforts. We're signing a bright light on our CBI efforts, and we're \u2013 the whole company is focused on continuing to drive up the contribution to organic growth from our innovation efforts. And so you put all of that together we're highly confident we can deliver our long-term kind of 4% plus organic, which is given our high levels of profitability, that's all we need to grow, EPS kind of high-single digit, low-double digit. You add an attractive dividend yield on top of that, and you're getting that 11 to 13 TSR over the long-term, not every year, this year, yes, but not every year. That's what you should expect from ITW. And it's much more about that than it is a quarterly market share number, which is, I think, what you're asking about. Sure. You're welcome."

            "name": "Scott Santi",
            "content": "Thanks, Karen, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, the ITW team delivered another quarter of strong operational execution and financial performance. Quarterly operating income grew 9% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time in ITW's history. Operating margin expanded 170 basis points year-on-year to 24.8%, a second quarter record with a 130 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. Operating margins for the company are now solidly above 2019 levels. And with a normalizing price/cost environment, we are back to making progress toward our 2030 goal of 30%. With regard to revenues, organic growth was 3% as stable underlying demand in many of ITW's industrial end markets was partially offset by inventory reductions at our end customers and channel partners in response to stabilizing supply chain performance. We estimate that this impacted organic growth by 1 point to 1.5 points in the quarter. GAAP EPS of $2.48 was also a Q2 record for the company and excluding one-off tax items in both years, grew \u2013 EPS grew 9%. Looking ahead, while customer and channel inventory normalization will continue to be a factor for the next several quarters at least, we expect stable underlying demand and continued strong margin and profitability performance through the balance of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year 2023 EPS guidance by $0.10 at the midpoint. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q2 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael? Hello Jeff. By you. Yes. Good morning. I think overall, it's been remarkably stable. If anything, we saw some firming up in the second quarter based on some trends in the first quarter that we talked about relative to 25% of our portfolio. I think the one place we saw things continue to weaken was in Europe on Construction between Q1 and Q2, but for the rest of the portfolio, I think, at this point, the best description is pretty firm. Good morning. Mostly from what we're hearing from our customers. We're not baking any of that into our back half... We'll take them when we see it. Good morning. I was going to say that I'm not current on the exact \u2013 what our businesses estimate is our share of our installed base, but last time I had the conversation I think it was sort of well into the low-20s at best maybe and don't sort of take that as possible, but at the point is that we have a lot of room to grow within \u2013 with just doing \u2013 giving more penetration with our current installed base globally. Yes. And that's been an active strategy for the last \u2013 really coming \u2013 really from before COVID. So some of it is coverage, some of it is programming. When you actually service the equipment you sell, we have lots of opportunity to integrate service offerings at the point we sell the equipment, which is part of the \u2013 why we think this is a big competitive advantage for us. So it's essentially all of the above, but there's no way to do service remotely. So we got to have service techs on the street. We've got, I think, north of 1,500 in North America and the same in Europe. And given the profitability of the business and how much runway we have we'll certainly continue to invest. That's part of what Michael talked about; continue to invest in our organic growth strategies that's certainly a good example. Yes, I'd say that there's been no change. We continue to get sort of apple flow in terms of people wanting us to take a look at things. And as we've talked about for a long time and certainly updated at our Investor Day, the aperture through which we will strike on those opportunities is pretty narrow given all the potential in our core business, but we've done MTS recently, and we will continue to opportunistically be aggressive. But from the standpoint of overall flow, is it up or down, I'd say it's been pretty stable. And it's not something you measure in a quarter or two. I think the long view, we've committed to organic growth in our organic growth goals in our \u2013 in the Investor Day we just did, and those are organic growth goals that are going to be well above underlying market growth at 4 to 5 and in that case by definition we will continue to take share."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  Karen Fletcher, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay, thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's first quarter 2023 Conference Call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's first quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year 2023. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2022 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Scott Santi.\nScott Santi: Thank you, Karen. And good morning everyone. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, we delivered a solid start to the year, with results coming in largely in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.  Starting with the top line, organic growth was 5% with four of seven segments delivering positive organic growth, led by Food equipment up 16%, Welding up 10%, Automotive OEM up 8% and Test & Measurement and Electronics up 6%. Polymers & Fluids was flat, Construction was down 1% and Specialty was down 5%.  Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 24.2% with 100 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. GAAP earnings per share increased 10% to $2.33, which was a new Q1 record for the company. Our free cash flow conversion rate was 86% of net income which was in line to modestly above normal Q1 levels.  Looking ahead at the balance of the year. While there is of course some uncertainty with regard to the macro environment, I have no doubt that my ITW colleagues around the world will continue to read react and execute at a high level to whatever comes our way.  I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q1 performance in more detail and our updated full year guidance, Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you Scott. And good morning everyone. ITW delivered another solid quarter operationally and financially, starting with organic growth of more than 5%. Foreign currency translation headwind and divestitures reduced revenue by 2%, and 1%, respectively.  On the bottom line, our operating income grew 9% with incremental margins of 98%. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 24.2% with enterprise initiatives and price costs contributing 100 basis points, and 190 basis points respectively.  In addition to higher wages and benefit costs year-over-year, were funding our growth investments including headcount in the areas that support our organic growth strategies and initiatives. And we still delivered 150 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter.  GAAP EPS grew 10% to $2.33, which included foreign currency translation a headwind of $0.06, and our Q1 tax rate was 22.6%. And as Scott said, it was encouraging to see our free cash flow performance return to normal levels. Overall for Q1, excellent operational execution across the Board and strong financial performance including record EPS. Please turn to Slide four, starting with positive organic growth in all of our major geographies. Including North America, which represents about 55% of total revenues, and grew 5%, and Europe is up 6%. Asia Pacific grew 2%, despite a 6% decline in China due to COVID related headwinds in Q1.  Moving on to segment results, starting with Automotive OEM and solid organic growth of 8%. North America was up 3% and Europe grew 16%. China was down 5% due to COVID related headwinds in Q1. And we're seeing the expected bounce back here at Q2.  In terms of automotive OEM margins, we are beginning to recover the price cost margin impact that has diluted margins in this segment by about 450 basis points over the last two years. As a result, we expect price cost margin impact to turn positive starting in Q2, which, combined with positive volume leverage and contributions from enterprise initiatives, will lead to higher margins sequentially and year-over-year starting in Q2 and for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered another strong quarter with organic growth of 16% as North America led the way with organic growth of 21%. Institutional end markets were up more than 50% with particular strength in education and lodging. In addition, restaurants were up more than 30%. International revenue grew 9%, with Europe up 11% and Asia Pacific was down 6% due to China. Strong progress on margins with Q1 operating margin of 26.7%, an increase of more than 400 basis points year-over-year. Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered organic growth of 6% despite a double-digit slowdown in semiconductor-related revenues, which represent about 20% of segment revenue. On the other hand, demand for our capital equipment remains strong as evidenced by Instron, for example, which was up 22%. Overall, Test & Measurement grew 12% organically and electronics was down 4%. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered double-digit organic growth of 10% in Q1 on top of 13% in Q1 last year as equipment grew 10% and consumables were up 11%. Industrial sales remained strong with organic growth of 17%, while the commercial side was down 2%. North America grew 10%, and international grew 12%, driven by strength in the oil and gas business, which was up 15%. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 31.9% a new record for the segment and the company. Organic growth in Polymers and Fluids was about flat against a difficult comparison of plus 13% last year. Automotive aftermarket was down 1%, Polymers grew 1% and Fluids was also up 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international declined 2%. Turn to Slide 7. Organic revenue and construction was down 1% against a tough comparison of plus 21% last year. Residential construction was down 1% and commercial construction, which represents a little less than 20% of the business in North America was up 5%. Europe was down 9%, and Australia, New Zealand was up 3%. Finally, Specialty organic revenue was down 5%, which included 3 percentage points of headwind from product line simplification. On a geographic basis, North America was down 4% and international was down 6%.  Okay, let's move to Slide eight, for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. As you saw this morning, we raised GAAP EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $9.45 to $9.85, which considers the lower projected tax rate for the full year in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty going forward, we're essentially holding our operational guidance and adjusting EPS to reflect the lower projected tax rate. Our organic growth projection of 3% to 5% reflects current levels of demand with some risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. Combined, foreign currency translation impact at current rates and divestitures are projected to reduce revenue by 1%.  Operating margin is projected to expand by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, which includes approximately 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and positive price/cost margin impact. Like I said, we're off to a solid start to the year with some positive momentum heading into Q2, and we remain well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge through the balance of 2023. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you.\nKaren Fletcher: Okay. Thank you, Michael. Rob, let's open up the line for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone. Michael, can you give us a little more color on to how you're thinking about the company's margins for the year? I know you didn't change your forecast, but as you said, was up 150 basis points in Q1. I think you guided us to 100 basis points, and you said price versus cost in Q1, I think you said it was 190 points. I know you're thinking about 100 basis points for the year. So are you thinking that should be materially higher now especially given your comps return in automotive so what held you back from not increasing your margin forecast for the year?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think Q1, Andy came in right along with our plan, really across the entire income statement and also on free cash flow. So Q1 margins expanded 150 basis points. That's typically the low point for the year. And so if you go back and look historically, you'd expect margins to improve from here in Q2 again in Q3 and Q4. And based on our current planning, we expect about 100 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year in each one of the remaining quarters. And actually, across our segments, we're seeing similar trends in terms of margins improving from here. We are -- if you look at kind of the bridge and we talk about this last quarter, as well we're certainly seeing some positive operating leverage from our organic growth this year. We're seeing at about 100 basis points of contribution from enterprise initiatives that's well within our own control based on projects and activities that are going on inside the company. We are starting to see price cost margin impact being positive. That really started in Q4.  And as you said, another step forward here in Q1, we expect that to remain positive for the remainder of the year. As you know, we've diluted margins about 250 basis points at the enterprise level over the last two years and maybe we'll recover about half of that this year, so maybe a little bit more than 100 basis points from price cost. And then the delta is what we talked about in terms of the investments that we're making to support our organic growth and including in our people. And so we are certainly seeing some increases there in terms of wages and benefit increases that everybody else is seeing. So that's kind of the margin picture for the year-end. I hope that answers your question.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Yes, Michael, that's helpful. And then last quarter, you said that 25% of your ITW businesses were slowing. Is that still the case? And those businesses end up slowing at the run rate you projected a maybe better or worse than you projected. And then Q1 is a bit higher than you predicted in terms of seasonality. Are you still thinking sort of that 49%, 51% in terms of EPS breakdown for the year?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think we're -- if you look at the -- what we talked about last quarter was about 25% of the company's revenues slowing down. And so just to maybe remind everybody, we're talking about residential construction. We're talking about commercial welding and the automotive aftermarket being down here in Q1 and kind of into in the low single digits. Our appliance components business and Specialty Products being down in the high single digits. And then semiconductor, we talked about orders coming down. We're now seeing that translate into revenues coming down in that 10% to 15% range, primarily in the Test & Measurement segment. So Q1 was actually in line with plan in terms of what we expected. We do expect some further slowing primarily in these -- this handful of businesses that I mentioned. And what I would just say...\nScott Santi: And that's not new. That's in our plan.\nMichael Larsen: Yes, that was in our plan, and that's included in our guidance and our plan for the rest of the year. I would just say there's a lot of strength in other parts of the company, obviously. The vast majority of our businesses are still seeing solid demand. We're always going to have some headwind and tailwind and it kind of all nets out to some pretty solid performance, as you saw in Q1, and we'd expect the same for the remainder of the year. I'll just say this, I mean, the environment, obviously, this is pretty uncertain at this point, things can change pretty quickly. But based on what we know today, we remain really well positioned to deliver solid performance here in Q2 and for the balance of the year.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Michael, are you still thinking that 49-51 split?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. From a planning standpoint, I think that's still a good assumption and in line with really what we have done historically.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. So you mentioned sequentially, you expect Automotive margins to get better from here on. How about sales? Should we also expect the first quarter sales to be the lowest of the year and then build from here? Or is there some seasonality that we should be modeling?\nMichael Larsen: I mean there is very little improvement from here on out. I mean, I think there -- it's really the growth rates year-over-year are more driven by the comparisons. So if you look at Q2 last year was there was a meaningful decline in -- or a lower number in auto builds that's going to be higher this year. So we will see some good growth in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, you're not going to see significant and certainly not an assumption baked in here in terms of significant revenue growth sequentially.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on to next person.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe two separate topics for me. If you think about the parts of the portfolio that are still resilient and you have visibility, I think one of the uncharacteristic things maybe you saw in the last year or so is backlog build where you wouldn't typically get backlog build. I just wonder if you could speak to that kind of your forward visibility on some of the things that are a bit later, longer cycle, are the backlogs holding, you're starting to burn into them? Any color on orders there would be interesting?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean I think as you point out, Jeff, we are not necessarily a backlog-driven company. And while backlogs have come down a little bit, they're still significantly higher today than kind of pre-COVID levels. So maybe not running at 2x, 3x, but at least 50% higher in businesses like Welding and Food Equipment where we're still seeing a fair bit of backlog. The other thing we talked about, Jeff, you know this as supply chain continues to moderate here in terms of the challenges we're going to see backlogs come down, and that's exactly what we're seeing across the company.\nJeff Sprague: And I wonder if you could speak longer term to auto margins. I think you said kind of 450 basis point hit from just the price cost, arithmetic and the game had catch up there. Margins are down only about 300 basis points, right over the last year or so. Are you actually pointing us to kind of higher structural margins in auto on the other side of this? I know we don't get it all in 2023, but are we had to do a higher place than we were a year or two ago in auto margins?\nScott Santi: Yes. I'm not sure, Jeff, the exact comp that you're referring to, but I think it's safe to say that auto margins, we see a low to mid-20s business over the next two or three years. And it's a combination of great growth prospects there. The fact that all the new programs that we add are margin positive and in fact, just to put in a plug for our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, we're going to spend some time detailing out sort of the margin path in auto in more substance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius. Your line is open.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning. Scott, Michael and Karen, I was wondering if you guys could give us a little bit of a window into what's going on in China. I think the April PMI came in a little lighter than what folks were expecting back down a contraction level, but they should be reopening. And I think January was probably the toughest month you had in the quarter. But you've had a chance, I'm guessing by now to see at least an early look at April. What are you seeing there kind of just from a macro perspective and perhaps into each of the businesses if that makes sense?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean I think we -- to answer your question, we're seeing a bounce back here in April, which supports a double-digit growth rate on a year-over-year basis in China here in the second quarter. We did see here in the first quarter, as you pointed out, particularly in January, several of our customers, the automotive OEMs as well as our restaurant food equipment businesses were slower to open up. So we were definitely down in automotive OEM. I think we said 5%. We were down in Food Equipment. Polymers & Fluids was also down kind of in that 15% to 20% range. And those businesses are all coming back pretty strong here in the second quarter. You'll see some big build numbers in automotive OEM in China. That business could be up significantly will be up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Also, the comps are easier here. So we're looking at a 40% to 50% growth rate in the automotive China business. Food Equipment is coming back, Polymers & Fluids, the Welding business. So it all adds up to something Q2 year-over-year up somewhere around 20%, which obviously includes the bounce back from January, and they're maybe a little bit slower than expected to be opening here in the first quarter.\nScott Davis: All right. That's helpful. And I want to go back to Jeff's question, and I don't want to blow up your Investor Day, but feel free to point. But is the era of price de-escalators or price downs and the auto contracts, is that era over with and we're at least over the next 5 years, you envision more of a flattish price environment? Or has nothing really changed. And at the end of the day, we're going to be back into that kind of usual down 1%, 2% price dynamic?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think it's more of the latter, to be honest here. I think the industry has not really changed in terms of how these contracts are structured where you get a lot of price upfront. And so the key there is to continue to innovate and solve problems for customers in ways that nobody else can. And so as you win new programs and get new content on vehicles, that has to come in at a higher price. But in terms of the structure price tons every year that has not changed at this point.\nScott Davis: Okay. Thank you for the integrity of answer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can we talk about your position in the Chinese like auto OEM market, there seems to be a real change that's happening there? And I'm just curious, how do you think your position is today? Do you need to do anything to kind of help scale the business? Just any thoughts around that would be helpful.\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think as you'll see, again, at Investor Day, there's been a pretty dramatic shift in that in what's been a very successful automotive business in China. The fastest-growing OEMs are our local to local Chinese OEMs and particularly on the EV side. And so will detail also at the Investor Day, some of the investments that we're making to support that growth and make sure that we have enough capacity and resources in terms of our innovation efforts to continue to win in the Chinese automotive business. So it is a very different business from 5, 10 years ago, but still very successful. And frankly, the organic growth prospects there in terms of above-market organic growth are really some of the best inside the company. So Joe, that's -- again, we'll spend a little more time on this at Investor Day, but we're certainly very optimistic on that business.\nJoe Ritchie: That's great to hear. I'm looking forward to learning more about it. I guess the follow-on question, and I know we've talked a little bit about the margin recovery in autos and we'll get more at Investor Day. I'm just curious, though, can you help maybe quantify how much of an impact price/cost was to the margins this quarter on a year-over-year basis. And I know that you're now forecasting for sequential improvement and year-over-year improvement as the year progresses. But how much of a benefit is it expected to be as we progress through the quarters?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So I think it was a slightly negative price cost margin automotive in Q1 and like I said we\u2019re expecting this to begin to turn positive here in the second quarter. We are seeing overall deflation on more of the commodities, including resins, nylon and acetyl those more basic commodities, those prices are coming down. And so that's part of what's helping us along with, like we said, new content coming in at higher margins. And so those combined will lead to the beginning of cost recovery, price cost margin recovery this year. But as Scott said, this could take two to three years. This takes a little bit longer in automotive OEM than in other parts of the company.\nScott Santi: And I'd just point out, following up on Michael's comments that our auto business still outperforms the peer benchmarks by a margin factor of 2.5x the returns on capital we generate are absolutely terrific and right in line with what we do also in the company. So from a long-term standpoint, these are short-term issues that we'll deal with, but it's not terrible by any stress. The business still performs really well.\nMichael Larsen: That's true.\nJoe Ritchie: Great. Thanks, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSteve Volkmann: Good morning, everybody. Michael, you sort of answered a small part of my question, but I'll ask the broader one. I'm curious what you're seeing across the company in terms of the cost side specifically? I think you mentioned a few of these commodities down maybe for automotive. Are there any other areas where you're seeing deflation on the cost side? And then the follow-on is any risk? Or how do you plan that going forward relative to your price? Is there any risk that kind of price follows that back down as that goes down? Thanks. \nMichael Larsen: Well, so I think, Steve, we're seeing -- I wouldn't say we're seeing significant deflation at this point. It's just costs are not going up anymore. There's maybe a little bit of deflation, like I said, in kind of the basic commodities that we mentioned. On components, so assembled parts, machine parts that have labor content, I think the costs are going to be a little stickier there, again, because of the labor component. In terms of our planning, consistent with how we always do this, our planning assumptions are based on all known cost increases and decreases as well as the price that we have either implemented or announced, I think we are kind of lapping these more inflation-driven price increases, and we're kind of back to normal price increases.  In terms of will those price increases stick as material costs potentially come down. I think we have only 5% of our revenues roughly is tied to an index. So the vast majority we would expect to certainly be able to maintain our historical price premium and at the same time, we want to compete and we want to gain market share, which is really the -- one of the big priorities, if not the number 1 priority of our enterprise strategy, which is strategic share gains to consistently grow organic growth above market. So that's how I would -- I think we'd frame that.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on the construction products. Market were quite a bit higher than I think some of us were looking for. Anything to call out there that was kind of margin goodness and how that sort of goes going forward?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean when you see something really unusual, the answer is usually price cost. So that's another segment that's been hit really hard over the last two years, actually, a little bit more than the automotive segment from a margin standpoint. And here, what you're seeing is we are beginning to recover the margin impact, which is what we talked about is about to start happening in the automotive business. So that combined to positive price cost combined with a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives actually above the average of the company. I think they were the highest inside the company at 170-odd basis points of contribution of enterprise initiatives. So those were the two big drivers in the construction business. And what's really encouraging is as we look kind of forward, this is not a onetime kind of Q1 impact, we expect to -- based on what the team is telling us to sustain those margins in the high 20s, which is pretty remarkable when you think about where we started pre-enterprise strategy somewhere around 12%. So we expect to sustain those high-20 margins certainly in the near term and medium term.\nSteve Volkmann: I appreciate. Thanks. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nChigusa Katoku: This is Chigusa Katoku on for Jamie. Thanks for taking my question. So on organic growth, you maintain the 3% to 5% guide. But I was just wondering if the outlook by segment just at around at all?\nMichael Larsen: And actually -- so of course, we looked at this. I mean, I think we're very close to what we told you on our last call when we gave guidance for the full year. We are seeing a lot of strength in automotive, food equipment, test and measurement, welding, construction, maybe a little bit better than what we had planned. But overall, kind of grand scheme of things, we are right in line with the assumptions that we gave you at the enterprise level when was that, 3 months ago, yes, last quarter.\nChigusa Katoku: Okay. Great. And then on price/cost. So you mentioned that it was 190 basis points positive this quarter. And you remember, you expect it to be positive for the remainder of the year. But I was wondering how we should think about cadence just because I thought there would probably be some puts and takes with auto just beginning to recover onward?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think 90 basis points from price cost and is not -- that's not your normal contribution. So I think we'll have -- based on what we know today, another similar contribution in the second quarter and then it will come down in the second half of the year just as we run into some of the comparisons around price.  But like I said, net-net, we -- you would expect somewhere around 100 to 150 basis points for the full year in terms of price-cost margin, in fact, based on what we know today, which obviously, there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment. But based on what we know today, that would be the expectation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. \nSabrina Abrams: You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you guys were talking about seeing further slowing through the rest of the year is embedded in the guidance, particularly in the 25% of businesses that you've already pointed to slowing. Are there other areas of the business that you would flag as maybe the next year to drop maybe based on current order activity?\nMichael Larsen: I'm not sure I understood the first -- you said CA slowing?\nSabrina Abrams: Just like the 25% of the businesses that you've pointed to slowing and I think you said those would be the -- where you see particularly further slowdown in the rest of the year. I'm just wondering if there's any incremental signs of softness you're seeing in other parts of the portfolio?\nScott Santi: I think that's a simple answer. The other 75% demand rates continue to be very strong.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think and Sabrina, the way maybe to think about it is there's a lot of strength in the more capital equipment businesses, food equipment, test and measurement, welding, there's a lot of strength in the automotive business on the top line, which is kind of on its own cycle. And then the more consumer-oriented, more interest rate sensitive and then semi is where there is some softness. And we've been calling out that softness really if you go back and look. I mean, since last summer, we started to see a slowdown in in construction, and it's played out in Q1, at least exactly like we thought it would. And so far, Q2 is off to a pretty good start.\nSabrina Abrams: Got you. And then you talked about reinvesting in the business. Can you talk about where adding headcount has been more of a focus?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think it's really across the enterprise. So it's -- we're not favoring one segment over another. Every business, every operating unit inside the company has significant organic growth opportunities in front of them, and they make the decisions in terms of where to allocate headcount and or to add headcount to support in support of their organic growth strategies. So there's not really one or two segments that are favored over another one. It's -- every 1 of our 84 divisions like I said, have significant organic growth opportunities in front of them and they're going after those by investing in innovation, commercial resources and capacity to support those customers.\nScott Santi: And I'll just add that I can reiterate something you said before, which is in all cases, those investments are self-funded, i.e., margins in every segment will continue to go up.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, this is all part of our -- you look at our long-term incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range, that\u2019s after making all the investments necessary to take full advantage of the organic growth opportunities that are in front of us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start just on consumables trends and what you're seeing. I think if we look at sort of polymers and specialty products and construction products, those tend to have some of the relatively higher consumables exposure across the businesses. Those are where we've seen some of the softer year-over-year organic trends. And so is that really just a function of consumer exposure? Or also, any signs of seeing some destocking maybe tied to some of these consumables? And if that is the case, any visibility on what inning we might be in terms of sort of inventory correction?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean there's certainly some inventory correction going on this quarter or last quarter, we saw that -- and again, it's not like we're selling directly to the consumer. These are all B2B businesses, but the end market, the end consumer or the end customer is a consumer. And those are the ones where we're seeing a little bit more softness, as you said. So I don't know if I have a whole lot more I can add to that.\nJoe O'Dea: Okay. And then also just wanted to circle back on the earnings cadence over the year and talking about the 49-51 split, I mean, it seems like it would actually imply maybe a little bit lower than normal weighting in the second quarter. Maybe the answer is you're talking about 100 bps, and it's overly nitpicking, but I just want to make sure it's not -- it doesn't sound like you're seeing sort of slowing relative to what you thought earlier in the year, such that we wouldn't see kind of a normal-ish second quarter?\nMichael Larsen: No. I think last quarter, we -- on this call, we talked about 49 51. I think it's still kind of in our planning assumption, 49%, 51%. And again, I'll just reiterate, that's based on what we're seeing today. I think there's a fair bit of uncertainty that everybody is dealing with right now. But that's kind of our -- that's our base planning assumption. And like I said, so far, Q2 is off to a good start.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Couple of ground, but I just want to dig into food equipment because that continues to suggest to really outperform quite nicely. So just curious where we are on the post reopening refresh cycle upgrade cycle? Any thoughts there on sort of the in-store base and share gains, et cetera?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think we've gained a lot of share in this business based on our ability to service and supply our customers with lead times when others maybe struggled. I think there's really nothing unusual going on in terms of the recovery, the equipment side, we'd say we have largely recovered at this point. And then on the service side, we're still picking up momentum, maybe an area where we're a little constrained in terms of our ability to take care of everybody on the service side. But overall, we are continuing to see some really strong demand trends in this business. This is an area we're talking about backlog earlier where the backlog is 2x normal levels, which gives us a little bit more visibility than what we're normally we were used to.  In terms of the end markets, as you know, our business is more focused on the institutional side, and we're seeing a lot of strength there, whether it's health care or education or lodging but also restaurants up 30% plus. I think we said this in the prepared remarks. So overall, really a lot of solid momentum here.  China was a little softer in Q1 as we talked about, I think that business was down about 20%, and so that's going to come back here in Q2 and for the remainder of the year. But certainly a business that's performing at a very high level, including on the margin side, it's really encouraging to see the margins back in in the high 20s again. So overall, I think a solid quarter and really well positioned for the remainder of the year.\nScott Santi: Just to take another plug for it -- sorry, Nigel. I was just going to.\nNigel Coe: Go ahead.\nScott Santi: That we will be featuring food equipment as one of the segments at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, just to make another plug for that event.\nNigel Coe: That would be great. And then just my follow-on is just going back to order margins. You've talked about price cost, I understand that. North America was 3% growth, Europe is 17%. Just wondering if there's a mix issue as well that maybe just essentially to that margin to the downside. And when you talk about sequential improvement in order margins in Q2, do you think that continues into the back half of the year, so we have a nice cadence Q-over-Q from here?\nMichael Larsen: The latter, the answer is yes, that's the current planning assumption that margins continue to improve from here on out in automotive. I think North America, you can't read too much into the quarterly build numbers. But if you look at overall builds were up, I think, about 10% in North America in Q1. But as you know, we are more concentrated with the D3 auto OEMs. So those -- they were up I think, about 2% in the quarter. So I don't think that has a significant margin impact necessarily. As I think we've talked about before, our margins are pretty comparable across customers as well as by geography. So not a huge mix issue, if you want.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to circle back to the organic sales guide for the year. Because in Q1, I think you did 5% the year sort of guided at 4 at the midpoint, the price/cost tailwind shrinks through the year, and I'm assuming therefore that the price revenue tailwind does as well.  So you're essentially assuming sort of flat volume growth or sort of steady volume growth Q2 to Q4 with Q1 or even an acceleration perhaps. But you've talked about 1/4 of the business seeing a slowdown. So maybe help us understand what's the sort of the quarter of the business that's accelerating volume-wise from Q1 to offset the 25% that's slowing more.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think what we talked about during on the last call was our guide of 3% to 5% organic, we expect that being organic growth in the first half of the year being closer to 5% and the second half closer to 3%, and that's really more of a comp year-over-year phenomenon than anything else. There's no assumption here built in, in terms of things accelerating in the back half. Our typical seasonality is Q1 is kind of the low point from a revenue standpoint. Q2, we see a step up and then again in Q3. And then Q4 is kind of similar to Q3. So that's -- again, those are the planning assumptions based on what we're able to kind of extrapolate as we sit here today. I would just add to I'd just add, they haven't changed. I mean I think Q1 came in right along with our expectations. And so we're kind of still right in line with that full year plan.\nJulian Mitchell: And is it fair to assume sort of firm why that price tailwind does taper through the year just as the sort of the price cost margin tailwind tapers?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. Maybe with the exception of the one business we talked a lot about today, which is the automotive OEM business, that's just beginning to recover we do expect that one to pick up here starting in the second quarter and then again in the second half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my follow-up would be on the Test & Measurement business, where I don't think there's been many questions, but some of the peers like say, Tektronix, Fortive or something. They were growing 20% plus in Q1. They're guiding to exit the year at flat. Just wondered on the sort of the core test and measurement piece aside electronics, how you're thinking about the balance of the year in terms of that rate of slowdown?\nMichael Larsen: Well, general and industrial demand for Test & Measurement equipment remains really strong. I think I mentioned Instron up 22%, another plug for our Investor Day, MTS, which will give you kind of a progress report was up 14% year-over-year in Q1. So those businesses are even more in line with some of the numbers that you were quoting. And really, the only challenges here are on the semi side, which is only about 20% of the segment.  And like we said those semi revenues are now down in that 10% to 15% range in Q1. We expect some further softness here in Q2 in that part of the business. But overall, I mean, I think organic growth of 6% and our margins kind of in the mid-20s after digesting a lower-margin acquisition and some really good progress in this segment.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s great. Thank you. \nKaren Fletcher: So that wraps things up. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And just a reminder, we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in Boston on May 18.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you Scott. And good morning everyone. ITW delivered another solid quarter operationally and financially, starting with organic growth of more than 5%. Foreign currency translation headwind and divestitures reduced revenue by 2%, and 1%, respectively.  On the bottom line, our operating income grew 9% with incremental margins of 98%. Operating margin improved 150 basis points to 24.2% with enterprise initiatives and price costs contributing 100 basis points, and 190 basis points respectively.  In addition to higher wages and benefit costs year-over-year, were funding our growth investments including headcount in the areas that support our organic growth strategies and initiatives. And we still delivered 150 basis points of margin improvement in the quarter.  GAAP EPS grew 10% to $2.33, which included foreign currency translation a headwind of $0.06, and our Q1 tax rate was 22.6%. And as Scott said, it was encouraging to see our free cash flow performance return to normal levels. Overall for Q1, excellent operational execution across the Board and strong financial performance including record EPS. Please turn to Slide four, starting with positive organic growth in all of our major geographies. Including North America, which represents about 55% of total revenues, and grew 5%, and Europe is up 6%. Asia Pacific grew 2%, despite a 6% decline in China due to COVID related headwinds in Q1.  Moving on to segment results, starting with Automotive OEM and solid organic growth of 8%. North America was up 3% and Europe grew 16%. China was down 5% due to COVID related headwinds in Q1. And we're seeing the expected bounce back here at Q2.  In terms of automotive OEM margins, we are beginning to recover the price cost margin impact that has diluted margins in this segment by about 450 basis points over the last two years. As a result, we expect price cost margin impact to turn positive starting in Q2, which, combined with positive volume leverage and contributions from enterprise initiatives, will lead to higher margins sequentially and year-over-year starting in Q2 and for the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment delivered another strong quarter with organic growth of 16% as North America led the way with organic growth of 21%. Institutional end markets were up more than 50% with particular strength in education and lodging. In addition, restaurants were up more than 30%. International revenue grew 9%, with Europe up 11% and Asia Pacific was down 6% due to China. Strong progress on margins with Q1 operating margin of 26.7%, an increase of more than 400 basis points year-over-year. Test & Measurement and Electronics delivered organic growth of 6% despite a double-digit slowdown in semiconductor-related revenues, which represent about 20% of segment revenue. On the other hand, demand for our capital equipment remains strong as evidenced by Instron, for example, which was up 22%. Overall, Test & Measurement grew 12% organically and electronics was down 4%. Moving on to Slide 6. Welding delivered double-digit organic growth of 10% in Q1 on top of 13% in Q1 last year as equipment grew 10% and consumables were up 11%. Industrial sales remained strong with organic growth of 17%, while the commercial side was down 2%. North America grew 10%, and international grew 12%, driven by strength in the oil and gas business, which was up 15%. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 31.9% a new record for the segment and the company. Organic growth in Polymers and Fluids was about flat against a difficult comparison of plus 13% last year. Automotive aftermarket was down 1%, Polymers grew 1% and Fluids was also up 1%. On a geographic basis, North America grew 1% and international declined 2%. Turn to Slide 7. Organic revenue and construction was down 1% against a tough comparison of plus 21% last year. Residential construction was down 1% and commercial construction, which represents a little less than 20% of the business in North America was up 5%. Europe was down 9%, and Australia, New Zealand was up 3%. Finally, Specialty organic revenue was down 5%, which included 3 percentage points of headwind from product line simplification. On a geographic basis, North America was down 4% and international was down 6%.  Okay, let's move to Slide eight, for an update on our full year 2023 guidance. As you saw this morning, we raised GAAP EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $9.45 to $9.85, which considers the lower projected tax rate for the full year in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty going forward, we're essentially holding our operational guidance and adjusting EPS to reflect the lower projected tax rate. Our organic growth projection of 3% to 5% reflects current levels of demand with some risk adjustment for further slowing in certain end markets. Combined, foreign currency translation impact at current rates and divestitures are projected to reduce revenue by 1%.  Operating margin is projected to expand by more than 100 basis points at the midpoint of our range, which includes approximately 100 basis points from Enterprise Initiatives and positive price/cost margin impact. Like I said, we're off to a solid start to the year with some positive momentum heading into Q2, and we remain well positioned to continue to outperform in whatever economic conditions emerge through the balance of 2023. With that, Karen, I'll turn it back to you. Well, I think Q1, Andy came in right along with our plan, really across the entire income statement and also on free cash flow. So Q1 margins expanded 150 basis points. That's typically the low point for the year. And so if you go back and look historically, you'd expect margins to improve from here in Q2 again in Q3 and Q4. And based on our current planning, we expect about 100 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year in each one of the remaining quarters. And actually, across our segments, we're seeing similar trends in terms of margins improving from here. We are -- if you look at kind of the bridge and we talk about this last quarter, as well we're certainly seeing some positive operating leverage from our organic growth this year. We're seeing at about 100 basis points of contribution from enterprise initiatives that's well within our own control based on projects and activities that are going on inside the company. We are starting to see price cost margin impact being positive. That really started in Q4.  And as you said, another step forward here in Q1, we expect that to remain positive for the remainder of the year. As you know, we've diluted margins about 250 basis points at the enterprise level over the last two years and maybe we'll recover about half of that this year, so maybe a little bit more than 100 basis points from price cost. And then the delta is what we talked about in terms of the investments that we're making to support our organic growth and including in our people. And so we are certainly seeing some increases there in terms of wages and benefit increases that everybody else is seeing. So that's kind of the margin picture for the year-end. I hope that answers your question. Yes. I think we're -- if you look at the -- what we talked about last quarter was about 25% of the company's revenues slowing down. And so just to maybe remind everybody, we're talking about residential construction. We're talking about commercial welding and the automotive aftermarket being down here in Q1 and kind of into in the low single digits. Our appliance components business and Specialty Products being down in the high single digits. And then semiconductor, we talked about orders coming down. We're now seeing that translate into revenues coming down in that 10% to 15% range, primarily in the Test & Measurement segment. So Q1 was actually in line with plan in terms of what we expected. We do expect some further slowing primarily in these -- this handful of businesses that I mentioned. And what I would just say... Yes, that was in our plan, and that's included in our guidance and our plan for the rest of the year. I would just say there's a lot of strength in other parts of the company, obviously. The vast majority of our businesses are still seeing solid demand. We're always going to have some headwind and tailwind and it kind of all nets out to some pretty solid performance, as you saw in Q1, and we'd expect the same for the remainder of the year. I'll just say this, I mean, the environment, obviously, this is pretty uncertain at this point, things can change pretty quickly. But based on what we know today, we remain really well positioned to deliver solid performance here in Q2 and for the balance of the year. Yes. From a planning standpoint, I think that's still a good assumption and in line with really what we have done historically. I mean there is very little improvement from here on out. I mean, I think there -- it's really the growth rates year-over-year are more driven by the comparisons. So if you look at Q2 last year was there was a meaningful decline in -- or a lower number in auto builds that's going to be higher this year. So we will see some good growth in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. But sequentially, you're not going to see significant and certainly not an assumption baked in here in terms of significant revenue growth sequentially. Yes. I mean I think as you point out, Jeff, we are not necessarily a backlog-driven company. And while backlogs have come down a little bit, they're still significantly higher today than kind of pre-COVID levels. So maybe not running at 2x, 3x, but at least 50% higher in businesses like Welding and Food Equipment where we're still seeing a fair bit of backlog. The other thing we talked about, Jeff, you know this as supply chain continues to moderate here in terms of the challenges we're going to see backlogs come down, and that's exactly what we're seeing across the company. Yes. I mean I think we -- to answer your question, we're seeing a bounce back here in April, which supports a double-digit growth rate on a year-over-year basis in China here in the second quarter. We did see here in the first quarter, as you pointed out, particularly in January, several of our customers, the automotive OEMs as well as our restaurant food equipment businesses were slower to open up. So we were definitely down in automotive OEM. I think we said 5%. We were down in Food Equipment. Polymers & Fluids was also down kind of in that 15% to 20% range. And those businesses are all coming back pretty strong here in the second quarter. You'll see some big build numbers in automotive OEM in China. That business could be up significantly will be up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Also, the comps are easier here. So we're looking at a 40% to 50% growth rate in the automotive China business. Food Equipment is coming back, Polymers & Fluids, the Welding business. So it all adds up to something Q2 year-over-year up somewhere around 20%, which obviously includes the bounce back from January, and they're maybe a little bit slower than expected to be opening here in the first quarter. Yes. I think it's more of the latter, to be honest here. I think the industry has not really changed in terms of how these contracts are structured where you get a lot of price upfront. And so the key there is to continue to innovate and solve problems for customers in ways that nobody else can. And so as you win new programs and get new content on vehicles, that has to come in at a higher price. But in terms of the structure price tons every year that has not changed at this point. Well, I think as you'll see, again, at Investor Day, there's been a pretty dramatic shift in that in what's been a very successful automotive business in China. The fastest-growing OEMs are our local to local Chinese OEMs and particularly on the EV side. And so will detail also at the Investor Day, some of the investments that we're making to support that growth and make sure that we have enough capacity and resources in terms of our innovation efforts to continue to win in the Chinese automotive business. So it is a very different business from 5, 10 years ago, but still very successful. And frankly, the organic growth prospects there in terms of above-market organic growth are really some of the best inside the company. So Joe, that's -- again, we'll spend a little more time on this at Investor Day, but we're certainly very optimistic on that business. Yes. So I think it was a slightly negative price cost margin automotive in Q1 and like I said we're expecting this to begin to turn positive here in the second quarter. We are seeing overall deflation on more of the commodities, including resins, nylon and acetyl those more basic commodities, those prices are coming down. And so that's part of what's helping us along with, like we said, new content coming in at higher margins. And so those combined will lead to the beginning of cost recovery, price cost margin recovery this year. But as Scott said, this could take two to three years. This takes a little bit longer in automotive OEM than in other parts of the company. That's true. Well, so I think, Steve, we're seeing -- I wouldn't say we're seeing significant deflation at this point. It's just costs are not going up anymore. There's maybe a little bit of deflation, like I said, in kind of the basic commodities that we mentioned. On components, so assembled parts, machine parts that have labor content, I think the costs are going to be a little stickier there, again, because of the labor component. In terms of our planning, consistent with how we always do this, our planning assumptions are based on all known cost increases and decreases as well as the price that we have either implemented or announced, I think we are kind of lapping these more inflation-driven price increases, and we're kind of back to normal price increases.  In terms of will those price increases stick as material costs potentially come down. I think we have only 5% of our revenues roughly is tied to an index. So the vast majority we would expect to certainly be able to maintain our historical price premium and at the same time, we want to compete and we want to gain market share, which is really the -- one of the big priorities, if not the number 1 priority of our enterprise strategy, which is strategic share gains to consistently grow organic growth above market. So that's how I would -- I think we'd frame that. Yes. I mean when you see something really unusual, the answer is usually price cost. So that's another segment that's been hit really hard over the last two years, actually, a little bit more than the automotive segment from a margin standpoint. And here, what you're seeing is we are beginning to recover the margin impact, which is what we talked about is about to start happening in the automotive business. So that combined to positive price cost combined with a significant contribution from enterprise initiatives actually above the average of the company. I think they were the highest inside the company at 170-odd basis points of contribution of enterprise initiatives. So those were the two big drivers in the construction business. And what's really encouraging is as we look kind of forward, this is not a onetime kind of Q1 impact, we expect to -- based on what the team is telling us to sustain those margins in the high 20s, which is pretty remarkable when you think about where we started pre-enterprise strategy somewhere around 12%. So we expect to sustain those high-20 margins certainly in the near term and medium term. And actually -- so of course, we looked at this. I mean, I think we're very close to what we told you on our last call when we gave guidance for the full year. We are seeing a lot of strength in automotive, food equipment, test and measurement, welding, construction, maybe a little bit better than what we had planned. But overall, kind of grand scheme of things, we are right in line with the assumptions that we gave you at the enterprise level when was that, 3 months ago, yes, last quarter. Yes. I think 90 basis points from price cost and is not -- that's not your normal contribution. So I think we'll have -- based on what we know today, another similar contribution in the second quarter and then it will come down in the second half of the year just as we run into some of the comparisons around price.  But like I said, net-net, we -- you would expect somewhere around 100 to 150 basis points for the full year in terms of price-cost margin, in fact, based on what we know today, which obviously, there's a fair bit of uncertainty in the environment. But based on what we know today, that would be the expectation. I'm not sure I understood the first -- you said CA slowing? Yes. I think and Sabrina, the way maybe to think about it is there's a lot of strength in the more capital equipment businesses, food equipment, test and measurement, welding, there's a lot of strength in the automotive business on the top line, which is kind of on its own cycle. And then the more consumer-oriented, more interest rate sensitive and then semi is where there is some softness. And we've been calling out that softness really if you go back and look. I mean, since last summer, we started to see a slowdown in in construction, and it's played out in Q1, at least exactly like we thought it would. And so far, Q2 is off to a pretty good start. Well, I think it's really across the enterprise. So it's -- we're not favoring one segment over another. Every business, every operating unit inside the company has significant organic growth opportunities in front of them, and they make the decisions in terms of where to allocate headcount and or to add headcount to support in support of their organic growth strategies. So there's not really one or two segments that are favored over another one. It's -- every 1 of our 84 divisions like I said, have significant organic growth opportunities in front of them and they're going after those by investing in innovation, commercial resources and capacity to support those customers. Yes. I mean, this is all part of our -- you look at our long-term incremental margins in that 35% to 40% range, that's after making all the investments necessary to take full advantage of the organic growth opportunities that are in front of us. Yes. I mean there's certainly some inventory correction going on this quarter or last quarter, we saw that -- and again, it's not like we're selling directly to the consumer. These are all B2B businesses, but the end market, the end consumer or the end customer is a consumer. And those are the ones where we're seeing a little bit more softness, as you said. So I don't know if I have a whole lot more I can add to that. No. I think last quarter, we -- on this call, we talked about 49 51. I think it's still kind of in our planning assumption, 49%, 51%. And again, I'll just reiterate, that's based on what we're seeing today. I think there's a fair bit of uncertainty that everybody is dealing with right now. But that's kind of our -- that's our base planning assumption. And like I said, so far, Q2 is off to a good start. Well, I think we've gained a lot of share in this business based on our ability to service and supply our customers with lead times when others maybe struggled. I think there's really nothing unusual going on in terms of the recovery, the equipment side, we'd say we have largely recovered at this point. And then on the service side, we're still picking up momentum, maybe an area where we're a little constrained in terms of our ability to take care of everybody on the service side. But overall, we are continuing to see some really strong demand trends in this business. This is an area we're talking about backlog earlier where the backlog is 2x normal levels, which gives us a little bit more visibility than what we're normally we were used to.  In terms of the end markets, as you know, our business is more focused on the institutional side, and we're seeing a lot of strength there, whether it's health care or education or lodging but also restaurants up 30% plus. I think we said this in the prepared remarks. So overall, really a lot of solid momentum here.  China was a little softer in Q1 as we talked about, I think that business was down about 20%, and so that's going to come back here in Q2 and for the remainder of the year. But certainly a business that's performing at a very high level, including on the margin side, it's really encouraging to see the margins back in in the high 20s again. So overall, I think a solid quarter and really well positioned for the remainder of the year. The latter, the answer is yes, that's the current planning assumption that margins continue to improve from here on out in automotive. I think North America, you can't read too much into the quarterly build numbers. But if you look at overall builds were up, I think, about 10% in North America in Q1. But as you know, we are more concentrated with the D3 auto OEMs. So those -- they were up I think, about 2% in the quarter. So I don't think that has a significant margin impact necessarily. As I think we've talked about before, our margins are pretty comparable across customers as well as by geography. So not a huge mix issue, if you want. Yes. I think what we talked about during on the last call was our guide of 3% to 5% organic, we expect that being organic growth in the first half of the year being closer to 5% and the second half closer to 3%, and that's really more of a comp year-over-year phenomenon than anything else. There's no assumption here built in, in terms of things accelerating in the back half. Our typical seasonality is Q1 is kind of the low point from a revenue standpoint. Q2, we see a step up and then again in Q3. And then Q4 is kind of similar to Q3. So that's -- again, those are the planning assumptions based on what we're able to kind of extrapolate as we sit here today. I would just add to I'd just add, they haven't changed. I mean I think Q1 came in right along with our expectations. And so we're kind of still right in line with that full year plan. Yes. Maybe with the exception of the one business we talked a lot about today, which is the automotive OEM business, that's just beginning to recover we do expect that one to pick up here starting in the second quarter and then again in the second half of the year. Well, general and industrial demand for Test & Measurement equipment remains really strong. I think I mentioned Instron up 22%, another plug for our Investor Day, MTS, which will give you kind of a progress report was up 14% year-over-year in Q1. So those businesses are even more in line with some of the numbers that you were quoting. And really, the only challenges here are on the semi side, which is only about 20% of the segment.  And like we said those semi revenues are now down in that 10% to 15% range in Q1. We expect some further softness here in Q2 in that part of the business. But overall, I mean, I think organic growth of 6% and our margins kind of in the mid-20s after digesting a lower-margin acquisition and some really good progress in this segment."

            "content": "Thank you, Karen. And good morning everyone. As you saw from our earnings release this morning, we delivered a solid start to the year, with results coming in largely in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.  Starting with the top line, organic growth was 5% with four of seven segments delivering positive organic growth, led by Food equipment up 16%, Welding up 10%, Automotive OEM up 8% and Test & Measurement and Electronics up 6%. Polymers & Fluids was flat, Construction was down 1% and Specialty was down 5%.  Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 24.2% with 100 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. GAAP earnings per share increased 10% to $2.33, which was a new Q1 record for the company. Our free cash flow conversion rate was 86% of net income which was in line to modestly above normal Q1 levels.  Looking ahead at the balance of the year. While there is of course some uncertainty with regard to the macro environment, I have no doubt that my ITW colleagues around the world will continue to read react and execute at a high level to whatever comes our way.  I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q1 performance in more detail and our updated full year guidance, Michael? And that's not new. That's in our plan. Yes. I'm not sure, Jeff, the exact comp that you're referring to, but I think it's safe to say that auto margins, we see a low to mid-20s business over the next two or three years. And it's a combination of great growth prospects there. The fact that all the new programs that we add are margin positive and in fact, just to put in a plug for our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, we're going to spend some time detailing out sort of the margin path in auto in more substance. And I'd just point out, following up on Michael's comments that our auto business still outperforms the peer benchmarks by a margin factor of 2.5x the returns on capital we generate are absolutely terrific and right in line with what we do also in the company. So from a long-term standpoint, these are short-term issues that we'll deal with, but it's not terrible by any stress. The business still performs really well. I think that's a simple answer. The other 75% demand rates continue to be very strong. And I'll just add that I can reiterate something you said before, which is in all cases, those investments are self-funded, i.e., margins in every segment will continue to go up. Just to take another plug for it -- sorry, Nigel. I was just going to. That we will be featuring food equipment as one of the segments at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks, just to make another plug for that event."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nErin Linnihan: Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning and welcome to ITW's third quarter 2024 conference call. Today, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Hairlehy, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's third quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for full year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Hairlehy. Chris?\nChris O'Hairlehy: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release this morning, during the third quarter, the market demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio with further softness in the Automotive and Construction markets. Overall, third quarter revenues came in approximately half a percentage point, or $25 million below what they would have been had demand held at the level we were seeing exiting the second quarter. That said, the slowdown in Q3 was less than in Q2, where revenue came in approximately one percentage point, or $50 million below run rate. As a result, third quarter organic revenue declined 1%, with five segments down year-over-year, partially offset by growth in two segments. This 1% revenue decline compares to our end markets, which we believe were down in the low to mid-single digits. As we have all year, the ITW team continued to successfully navigate and overcome these market challenges with strong operational execution. Those efforts resulted in operating income of $1.05 billion with operating margin of 26.5%, which included a 130 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. With little operating leverage, six of seven segments still increased operating margin, resulting in segment operating margin expansion of a 110 basis points. EPS grew 4% to $2.65, excluding the gains from the divestiture that Michael will review in more detail. The continued contribution from enterprise initiatives, regardless of volume, speaks to the power and resilience of our business model. And it is notable that for the first time, three of our segments delivered operating margin above 30% in the quarter. And we are well on our way to achieve our goal of 30% operating margin for the company by 2030. Our continued focused execution and typical operational excellence have enabled ITW to effectively counter persistent market headwinds and achieve increased profitability, where we continue to invest to maximize growth and performance over the long term. Consistent with our long-term commitment to return surplus capital to shareholders by an attractive and growing dividend, on August 2nd, we announced our 61st consecutive dividend increase, raising our dividend by 7%. And year-to-date, we have repurchased more than $1.1 billion of our outstanding shares. Today, we are raising our full-year GAAP EPS guidance by a $1.33, from a range of $10.30 to $10.40, to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73, to incorporate the impact of the divestiture gain and a lower projected tax rate for the full year. Based on current levels of demand exiting Q3, we are maintaining our previous operational guidance for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for the year and our operating margin to be between 26.5% and 27%. While the ITW team is in a commendable job managing the short-term challenges this year, perhaps more importantly, we continue to deliver solid progress on our next phase enterprise strategy priorities. As we outlined to you a year ago, the central focus of the next phase of our enterprise strategy is to elevate high-quality organic growth and customer-backed innovation as key ITW differentiators, on par with our best-in-class operational capabilities and financial performance. This quarter, we made further progress in our journey to achieve this strategic goal. We believe that customer-backed innovation, or CBI as we call it, is the most impactful driver of our ability to consistently grow revenue above market. In essence, the customer-backed innovation revenue of today fuels the ability to drive market penetration and share gain in the future. Over the past few years, we've made progress on expanding our revenue from CBI from less than a percent in 2017 to approximately 2% today. And at our September Leadership conference, we launched the next phase CBI framework for our 84 divisions around the world. Just as we successfully focused the entire organization on 80-20 front-to-back over a decade ago, we are now doubling down on customer-backed innovation. And I, for one, can feel the energy, excitement, and momentum from our team as they implement this strategy at each division. With our continued laser focus on our typical do-what-we-say execution, it is with strong conviction that I know we will build above-market organic growth fueled by customer-backed innovation into a defining ITW strength. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers with excellence and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q3 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael.\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, and as expected, the third quarter ended up looking a lot like the second quarter with continued strong operational execution in a moderating demand environment. Total revenue declined 1.6%, with organic revenue down 1.4%. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 0.4%, and acquisitions increased revenue by 0.2%. On a geographic basis, organic revenue declined about 3% in North America. Europe was down 0.5% and Asia Pacific was down 1% with China, essentially flat. In this environment, the ITW team continued to focus and execute well on the things that we can control as evidenced by six of our seven segments, expanding operating margin, driven primarily by enterprise initiatives that contributed between 70 and a 180 basis points to each segment and a 130 basis points at the enterprise level. Third quarter operating margin was 26.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter and flat with the prior year due to a tough comparison. As you may recall, last year's Q3 margin of 26.5% expanded 200 basis points compared to 2022 due in part to the favorable impact of a few corporate items that we discussed on the call last year, including a one-time insurance recovery. Excluding those one-time items last year and looking just at segment operating margin, which is included in the press release tables, our segment operating margin increased by a 110 basis points compared to the prior year, which is more in line with our typical margin expansion on a quarterly basis. GAAP EPS of $3.91 was up 53% and included a $1.26 gain from the divestiture of our non-controlling equity interest in Wilsonart. Excluding this gain, EPS of $2.65 was an increase of 4% year-over-year. I want to spend a minute on a previously announced Wilsonart divestiture. The proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs were approximately $395 million, which we reduced to reduce our commercial paper balance. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $363 million and income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of a $107 million related to the utilization of capital loss carry forwards, which resulted in the favorable GAAP EPS impact of a $1.26. Free cash flow was $783 million, which was 102% conversion of adjusted net income. And as Chris mentioned in the third quarter, we raised our dividend by 7% to an annualized payout of $6 per share, which marks our 61st consecutive year of increases. And as planned, we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter of 14.9% was below our typical tax rate in the 24% to 25% range. As you can see from the reconciliation, the press release, the tax rate was favorably impacted by several discrete items in the quarter, including the Wilsonart transaction. Excluding these discrete items, our core tax rate was 23.7%. So in summary, the third quarter looked a lot like the second quarter with moderating, but also stable demand and solid operating margin and profitability performance as we continue to focus and execute well on the things that we can control. Please turn to Slide 4, for a look at our year-to-date segment margin performance. And as you can see from the table on the left side, six of our seven segments have expanded their already best-in-class margins year-to-date and three segments by more than a 100 basis points. Food Equipment is a bit of an outlier due to the growth investments in our service business and specifically the near-term inefficiencies associated with on-boarding of new service technicians to support accelerated organic growth in this business. This margin headwind is now largely behind the Food Equipment segment as evidenced by a 110 basis points of margin improvement in the third quarter. Total company margin is up a 180 basis points, which in fairness includes a 100 basis points from the one-time LIFO adjustment in the first quarter, but still solid performance in the current environment. Moving to the segments and starting with Automotive OEM, organic revenue declined 3% in the third quarter as industry build rates continue to come down. North America was down 6% as the D3 customer bills were down 9%. Europe was down 5% and China was down 2%. Compared to the automobile industry build data, the segment has outperformed bills by about 200 basis points year-to-date and we expect similar outperformance in the fourth quarter. The segment also delivered solid operating margin performance of 19.4% and 50 basis points increase despite lower volume and we expect more progress in the fourth quarter and next year as we continue to work towards our long-term goal of achieving operating margins in the low to mid 20s by 2026 in this segment. Turn to Slide 5, organic revenue in Food Equipment was about flat against a tough comp of plus 6% last year as equipment was down 4% and offset by service, which grew 7%. Regionally, North America was down 2% after being up 10% last year with institutional sales about flat as healthcare was up mid single digits and restaurants were down about 10%. International was solid up 3% with the service business up 8% and Europe up 4%. Operating margin improved a 110 basis points due to the service margin normalizing and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect margin to continue to improve as we go through the year. Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down only 1% after being down 3% last quarter with stable demand in Semiconductor Electronics and CapEx sensitive end markets. While Test & Measurement was down 3%, Electronics was up 1% in the quarter after being down 3% last quarter. And this marked the first quarter of positive growth in Electronics since the end of 2022. And we're beginning to see increased Semiconductor customer activity suggesting that perhaps we are near a bottom for this market. As we've discussed before, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this space when the inevitable recovery does happen. Operating margin expanded by 190 basis points in the quarter to 25.7%. Moving on to Slide 6, Welding's organic revenue declined 1%, a meaningful improvement from being down 5% in the second quarter as both Equipment and Consumables revenue declined 1%. Both America revenue was down 2% but International was up 6% with solid growth in Europe and China. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, the Welding team was planning on a solid contribution to the top line from the launch of new products, which in the third quarter resulted in a 3% plus contribution to growth. And this is just one of many examples inside the company that illustrates how continued progress on CBI as Chris was talking about, gives our segments the ability to gain share and outgrow their end markets. Operating margin of 32.3% was a third quarter record for the Welding segment. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue grew 1% with Polymers up 10% due to international strength and Fluids was up 3%. Automotive aftermarket, which as you know, is tied closely to consumer discretionary spending was down 3% in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 5% and International grew 11% with Europe again showing solid demand. Turn to Slide 7, organic revenue in Construction products was down 9% as Construction end markets took a sizable step back from the second quarter with new housing starts down 10% on an annualized basis as compared to down 6% in the second quarter. As a result, North America declined 10% with residential down 12% and commercial construction down 7%. Europe was down 4% and Australia and New Zealand was down 11%. Despite the lower volume, operating margin of 30.2% was a record for the segment with another significant contribution from enterprise initiatives. Finally, specialty products had a solid quarter with organic revenue growth of 6% with strength across the portfolio as both Equipment and Consumables were up 6%. North America was up 8% and International grew 2%. The 6% growth rate for the segment included about 200 basis points of PLS or product line simplification in the quarter. As we continue to make progress on repositioning some of our specialty products divisions for consistent above market organic growth. We expect about 300 basis points of PLS in the fourth quarter and that the segment will be flat to up low single digits for the full year. Operating margin expanded 330 basis points to 31.1%, a third quarter record for the segment with strong contributions from operating leverage and enterprise initiatives. Moving to Slide 8 and our updated full year 2024 guidance. As you've seen all year, the ITW team continues to execute at a very high level and find a way to leverage our business model and high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver solid operational and financial results in a challenging demand environment. Looking ahead at the fourth quarter, we do not expect the near-term demand environment to improve, and as usual, our guidance is based on current levels of demand, seasonally adjusted, and foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we're maintaining our previous projection for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for the year. We're also maintaining our full year operating margin guidance, which is projected to be between 26.5% and 27%, an improvement of a 165 basis points at the midpoint, with enterprise initiatives contributing more than a 100 basis points. As you saw in the press release, we incorporated the impact of the Wilsonart divestiture gain and a lower projected effective tax rate of 21.5% for the full year into our EPS guidance, as we raised GAAP EPS guidance from a range of $10.30 to $10.40 per share by $1.33 to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73 per share. Excluding the Wilsonart gain, EPS range is $10.37 to $10.47 per share, or $10.42 at the midpoint. So, in summary, while the overall demand environment remains pretty uncertain and challenging in the near term, we remain laser-focused on leveraging ITW's unique strengths and capabilities to optimize our ability to deliver differentiated performance over the long term. And with that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you.\nErin Linnihan: Thank you, Michael. Kathleen, will you please open the queue for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nJeff Sprague : Hello. Good morning, everyone.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague : Good morning. Hey, I just wanted to sort of pick up sort of where you left off there, Michael, with kind of the trends into the fourth quarter. I don't know, unless my math is wrong, I think kind of sequentially you're looking at revenues of maybe 4% or 5%, when normally they declined slightly. So, was your exit rate in September or your early read in October kind of better than what we saw in the quarter in aggregate? Or maybe you could just clarify if I'm missing anything there.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah, sure, Jeff. So, let me start by saying, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. And as you were trying to do based on our year-to-date performance and our full year guidance, you can get pretty close in terms of figuring out Q4. But maybe let me try to help out a little bit. So, I'd say at a high level, Q4 looks a lot like Q3. Typically what we see from a seasonality standpoint is a sequential improvement in revenues from Q3 to Q4, about a point to a point and a half. And that's going all the way back to 2017. So, at current run rates, typically we're up a point to a point and a half. We do have easier comparisons in the fourth quarter. And for what it's worth, there's also an extra shipping day in the quarter. So, you add all that up, we get to about flat revenues on a year-over-year basis. We expect, again, our typical margin improvement of about 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So, that is a slight decline from Q3 to Q4, which is kind of the typical seasonality. And the main driver here remains another strong contribution from the enterprise initiatives. And then factoring in a more kind of normal tax rate for us in that 24%, 25% range. And you get to EPS at the midpoint. And I'm just doing the math. I'm not giving guidance that's in that 2.51 range for the fourth quarter. So, I'll just add, while we're talking about the fourth quarter, we do expect a strong quarter, again, from a free cash flow standpoint. And we're projecting some meaningful improvement on our inventory levels in the fourth quarter, which is not easy in the current demand environment. So, hopefully that's helpful, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague : Yes. No, it's very helpful. Thanks for that color. And then just kind of secondarily, your business in China is not huge. It's very important for Auto, though. And it was just kind of interesting that China Welding was solid. A lot of cross-currents there. Like, we had some pretty ugly China numbers out of Trane and Otis today. Those are different businesses, obviously. But maybe this is for Chris. Can you just maybe give us your bigger picture view on what's going on there? And also just kind of given the importance of Auto, anything in this kind of China-Europe tariff spat around Automotive influence your view or outlook at all?\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yeah. So, I think from the Auto China standpoint, Jeff, I mean, China builds this year in Auto are expected to be up 1%. We expect to be up 8%. So, our businesses continue to penetrate very successfully in China. And EV obviously is a large part of the story, given the fact that China is producing about 60% of the world's EVs. But we're making very strong penetration gains in EV in China, as evidenced by the market growth. In Auto in general, we expect to be up a couple of percent against flat builds this year. Sorry, flat versus negative down 2% -- up 2%, I would say as we have been kind of historically would expect to be on into the future. And that that strength has been pretty much across all three geographies, Europe, North America, but especially in China.\nMichael Larsen: So, let me just add a little bit of color. So, I think if you look at the third quarter, about flat with Auto, as we said down 2. And certainly some challenges also in Test & Measurement down single-digit, low single-digits, same in Food Equipment. So, strength in Welding which is tied to oil and gas, LNG, transportation, and also some strength in our specialty products, appliance business. So, you all add up, you get to about flat for the quarter, up 6% year-to-date. We think in the fourth quarter, as Chris said, we'll see a pickup on the Automotive side, continued strength in Welding. And so, Q4 should be kind of flat, maybe up a low single-digit and the full year up in that 5% range. So, as we sit here today, I think we feel pretty good about China. I know there's a lot of talk about stimulus and so forth. We haven't seen a lot of that yet. So, if that's still to come, that would certainly be helpful. But as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about China.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Okay. Thank you for the color.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook : Hi, good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Morning.\nJamie Cook : I have two questions. One, I was impressed with the specialty growth in the quarter despite headwinds from PLS and I know Specialty is special, because there's a lot of different businesses in there. Can you just sort of break down what you're seeing within that business? What segments drove sort of the organic growth? That would be my first question. And then I'll give you my follow-up after that.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yeah. So, Jamie, I think a good part of the Specialty story is strengthened Aerospace. We have one particular business that's focused on Aerospace. And again, we saw about 30% growth in that business this quarter. We saw, I'd say, pockets of strong demand I think throughout the segment, areas like consumer packaging. Consumer packaging equipment were also pretty strong. And we did have some favorable comms in Specialty versus last year. But even with all that, we expect Specialty to be up kind of low single-digits for the full year. And it's really strengthening our conviction that on the basis of the strategic portfolio positioning we've been doing in that segment, which involves some, as we said before, some product line pruning throughout the segment which is certainly choppy, and it's creating a bit of a drag, as Michael just indicated a couple of 100 basis points this year. But what it does, what this is all doing is really strengthening our conviction that the objective to make Specialty a 4% grower in the long term is well on track here. And everything we've seen this year gives us a strong belief that we can do that.\nMichael Larsen: And I think the only thing I'd add is just, Jamie, if you look at the margin performance, you can see what happens at ITW, and this is not unique to Specialty when you get a little bit of operating leverage, suddenly you're in that 31% plus range, which is certainly very encouraging and gives us, as we said earlier, a lot of conviction and ability to get to that 30% target at the enterprise level with three segments this quarter above 30%, which is, that's the first time that's happened. And again, that's with very little operating leverage. So that's certainly really, really gives -- pretty encouraging as we look also into next year in terms of the momentum around the margin performance of the company continues.\nJamie Cook : And that's helpful, because I think some of the bears think the 30% plus is challenging for you guys to do. So it's nice to see that. I guess one more follow up. Chris, you talked about market outgrowth in Auto. You talked about Welding from the new product introductions, and even on Food, the increased service effort. As you go through CBI, and you're now, you've been with ITW forever, but CEO for a longer period of time. Are there any businesses that you're considering are more challenged, like over the longer term that you think is going to be tough to get to the organic growth targets that you have? You don't have to say which ones, but just understanding if there's any difference in how you're thinking about the portfolio relative to when you first took over. Thanks.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Not at all, Jamie. I think if we go back to Investor Day last year, we were very overt in our comments that we felt that all seven of our segments have the capability to grow 4% plus. And we certainly believe that today, and even more so. With respect to CBI, the CBI opportunity, I think is very relevant across all seven segments. And we're at different points in terms of the development around that. But I think, everything we've seen would indicate that all these segments have a pretty fertile innovation environment, have critical customer pain points that are there to be solved. We're certainly mobilizing the company around that in very similar way to where we mobilized the company around front to back 10, 12 years ago. With the same kind of capability build and investment in resources, a much higher level of leadership kind of time and focus around CBI, we have lots of great innovation practice across the company. And we've now codified that into a very effective innovation framework. And this is the exact same approach that we took on 80-20 front to back, which as we know was very successful. And we've seen this. I mean, this is not something that's starting today. We've been working on this for a couple of years now in terms of focused investment in resources and CBI. And we've seen that in terms of the improvement in yield that we've seen from CBI. So there is a lot of conviction here that the yield improvement from one to somewhere over two today will be north of three in due course. And we have a very clear path to doing that. And like I said, that's going to result in improvements in every one of our segments on the ultimate journey to having every one of these segments growing at 4 plus.\nJamie Cook : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citi Group. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone.\nMichael Larsen: Morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Chris and Michael, I know you've been hopeful about a turn in Test & Measurement for much of this year. And you did mention maybe more positive discussions with Semiconductor customers and you did see Electronics turn positive. So maybe you can give us some more color on the conversations you're having. The outlook obviously, you're always going to predict run rates, but as you go into \u201825, do you see a better outlook for the segment?\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yeah, I think based on the customer conversations that we are having, we're starting to see a bottoming, particularly in Semi. Just to characterize, Semi is about 15% of Test & Measurement. It represents a couple of percent of ITW's revenues. So just to put it in context, but there's no doubt that we saw a bottoming and slight improvement in this, I think, in the third quarter. Electronics, similarly, had been down for quite a while, significantly down earlier this year. It's starting to bottom there as well. And then I think an important kind of bellwether for us, the Instron business, which is a critical business within Test & Measurement, had very solid growth during the quarter. And that's certainly encouraging as we look here for the balance of the year and on into next year.\nAndy Kaplowitz : It's helpful, Chris. And then, Michael, I think you mentioned, I think, what you call the solid step back in Construction markets in Q3. Do you see any hint of stabilization as you go toward the end of the year in those markets? I mean, obviously, we started a U.S. rate cutting cycle. Maybe what changed in Q3 versus Q2 in your businesses that led to this step down?\nMichael Larsen: Well, I think, Andy, we're talking about our most interest rate-sensitive segment. So, I think what we're seeing here is a market that's down in the low teens. I pointed in the script to kind of the housing start numbers being down 10% on an annualized basis, which kind of mirrors our business in North America. Maybe we're a little bit better than that. And then we're seeing similar type of softness in Australia, New Zealand, which is a meaningful part of our business. So, I think at this point, it's really too early to point to any signs or indicators that things are getting better here. Over the long term, certainly the fact that interest rates appear to be coming down has been a leading indicator, but we've not seen anything to suggest that things are picking up in Construction at this point. So, and I'll just say in that context, I think it's even more remarkable that we -- the team put up margins of 30% plus here in the third quarter in an environment that's certainly pretty challenging. So, and about as challenging as we see across the company at this point in the cycle.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys.\nMichael Larsen: Sure. See you, Andy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nTami Zakaria : Hi, good morning, Team ITW. Hope you're doing well.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Good morning, team Tami.\nTami Zakaria : Thank you. So, my first question is on margins. Very nice margin performance in the quarter. I'm curious, what was price cost in the quarter? And more broadly, how are you thinking about Enterprise initiative and related margin improvement potential in 2025? It seems like almost like an endless well at this point, and I mean it positively. So, any forward-looking comments about Enterprise initiatives and what you're expecting for next year would be helpful.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah, let me do price cost and then, Chris, if you can add some commentary on Enterprise initiatives. But I think at this point Tami, as we said before, price cost has kind of normalized. This is no longer a distraction as it was back in \u201821, \u201822, and \u201823. At this point, price dollars are ahead of costs on a dollar basis and modestly positive from a margin standpoint. Now, that, just to be clear, doesn't mean that costs are coming down, particularly Electronics, Energy in certain geographies, components that have labor content. We're also seeing it in our employee costs, health and welfare, and other pockets, overhead costs such as just to point out, rental expense, leases, software licenses. So, we have to continue to be very diligent in this area and make sure that we get price to offset all of these pressures. But overall, nothing significant to point to on the price cost equation. And then maybe on the Enterprise initiatives, Chris.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Sure. So Tami as we said, Enterprise initiatives continue to be an important contributor to results. And how we think about these initiatives is that these initiatives, they are independent of volume and they're really an outcome of the continuous improvement mindset that's very much part of ITW's DNA, I would say. And this is what really drives this divisional kind of quality of practice and 80-20 front to back in sourcing. And typically very bottom-up initiatives driven by our talented people in our divisions at a very granular level. Most of these initiatives are in the couple of hundred thousand dollar range and in terms of individually. But when you have 84 divisions, these add up to a very meaningful number. So, the divisions have a lot of visibility, ownership, and accountability on these. And the track record has indicated over the last 11 years, our divisions are going to do what they say when they forecast these. So, our confidence on enterprise initiatives going forward, that this will continue really is an outcome of this strong ownership and accountability that resides in our divisions and the strong continuous improvement mindset that I refer to that's really hardwired into our divisions at this point. And the case of 80-20, as we know, this is the gift that keeps on giving. So, with that we certainly see an ongoing contribution from Enterprise initiatives going forward, including in 2025. And this is a fundamental part of how we drive differentiated execution in any environment.\nTami Zakaria : Got it. That is very helpful. Thank you. And my second question is more strategic. So, there's a lot of optimism around data centers, AI, power generation, power demand, so on and so forth. How do you assess these opportunities internally? Do you see an opportunity for ITW to increase this exposure to some of these trends, maybe organically or through acquisitions? So, how do you evaluate some of these scenes?\nChris O'Hairlehy: So, I think as it relates to data centers specifically, we have standard characteristics of businesses that we would pursue for acquisition based on sustainable differentiation. So, if an opportunity came along that was data center related and met our normal criteria, then we'd be all in based on the characteristics of having a business that could grow above market, that we could leverage our business model, and we could acquire at the right valuation. And that applies to everything, not just data centers. So, we don't have a specific focus on data centers. We kind of look at all these things on an equal basis in terms of their long-term attractiveness for us.\nTami Zakaria : Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe O\u2019Dea : Hi. Good morning. First, just wanted to ask on, and kind of specific to North America, but interested in kind of CapEx versus OpEx trends, and I think appreciating a pretty quick book and ship model. I'm not sure how much you would see this, but we do hear about inquiry activity being better than order activity out there. And so, curious the degree to which you see some of that or hear some of that from your salesforce and customer tone. As I think about rates starting to come down, I think some folks waiting for getting post-election, and just the idea that you're getting a sense that there is some pent up demand that hasn't moved forward with some uncertainty overhang, and thoughts on that potentially moving forward nearer term.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Well, I think, Joe, I'd start by saying we're not economists and we're not trying to predict the impossible here, which is where the economy is going. We are, as you said much more short cycle. Our divisions do a great job kind of reading and reacting to what's going on in their respective end markets. I would just make a broader comment based on what we saw in the third quarter, which is some stability in the more CapEx sensitive businesses. So, I'll point to Welding, as I mentioned. I'll point to Test & Measurement, including our Instron business, which was up in a meaningful way on a year-to-year basis and improved kind of quoting and order activity. So, maybe that squares with what you were talking about. And then the softness in Q3 was really much more tied to Construction and Automotive production, specifically with our customers, with the T3 customers. But certainly some stability in CapEx, and we'll see where it goes from here. We're modeling based on current run rates. So, based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, and we'll see how it all plays out as we go into 2025. And interest rates maybe -- would be a little helpful if they came lower for sure. So\u2026\nJoe O\u2019Dea : Nope, I appreciate that color. And then just wanted to ask on CBI, as we think about it becoming sort of a growing initiative. Just what it means on the R&D side and the degree to which you can keep R&D relative to sales at sort of similar levels or what you're doing there, as we would think, to drive more innovation you might need to allocate a little bit more there.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yeah, so for us spend in R&D or innovation is largely an outcome of basically request more divisions. Basically, we fund all the good projects. We've been making over the last three or four years, making very focused investments in areas like innovation and strategic marketing. We expect that to continue. But if that number was to go up, that's not a problem for us. It's really an outcome of funding all these good projects. And our teams are really focused on their 80 opportunities in their markets with their key customers. And whatever we spend in R&D typically is an outcome of that. And we're very happy to spend it because it's typically money well spent on the degree of focus that our businesses have.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah. And just from a numerical standpoint, I'd say, R&D spend the way we've defined it here over the years is about 1.8% of sales. So as sales grow, so will the R&D dollar spend. And we don't foresee any significant change in that as we go forward. As Chris said, we really fund every project that our divisions put forward and that's important to them. And so that's how we approach it here. Really in terms of it's an outcome of this process that Chris described.\nJoe O\u2019Dea : Appreciate it. Thank you.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sabrina Abrams of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSabrina Abrams : Hi, good morning. As a follow up to some of the CBI commentary and questions, I think back at your investor day, the framework for CBI for segment was about 2% to 3% contribution and its most meaningful driver to reach long term targets. Are you on track for that this year? And I understand it's relevant to all seven segments. But maybe if you could provide any color on which segments you think are more mature in this journey.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yeah, so we're very much on track to do 3% plus inline with our target by 2030, if not indeed before that, based on the progress that we are making. We're at varying levels of accomplishment currently across our seven segments. I would point to Welding as an example. This year, as we've highlighted, Michael highlighted his commentary, our Welding business is suffering some significant end market challenges, but we're getting north of 3% contribution CBI in Welding. As we forecasted at the beginning of the year, several new product launches. So Welding will be one, Test & Measurement, Electronics, obviously an area of significant attractiveness around innovation in the context of what's going on in those markets. New materials being developed, all of which require to be tested, increasing stringency in areas like R&D and in quality control, all of which requires more and more sophisticated testing equipment which really speaks to our competitive advantages. And then the other one I'd highlight is Food Equipment. Food Equipment, sustainability in areas of energy savings, water savings is a very fertile innovation environment, and we've managed to leverage that for several years. And the other one, of course, I point to is Auto. Auto, given the disruptive nature of Auto right now, particularly with the increased penetration of electric vehicles, provides enormous opportunity for innovation. And we're capitalizing on that as evidenced by the fact that our electric vehicle penetration into electric vehicles is higher than the market average. So, I feel pretty good about all seven segments, but those are the four that I'd highlight right now.\nSabrina Abrams : Thank you. And it seems some of the above average PLS in Specialty products is behind us and that business is growing nicely. You guys got rid of Wilsonart. Moving past some of this portfolio rationalization, is there more appetite to do M&A, given some of these divestitures are behind us?\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yes, I would say our posture on M&A hasn't changed. And since we outlined this at the leadership conference. And we've got a pretty disciplined portfolio strategy. We believe clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy. And so it's a case of us finding the right opportunities. And for us, we're focused on high quality acquisitions that extend our ability to grow at a minimum 4% over the long term. That's the first criteria. The second criteria we look at is that we're able to leverage the business model to improve margins and then obviously acquiring the business at the right valuation to provide a decent long term return for our shareholders. We review opportunities on an ongoing basis, but we're very selective on the basis of these criteria. And if I could point to MTS as an example, MTS was an example of an acquisition we did 2.5 years ago, which fulfilled all of our criteria. And thanks to a very strong execution. That's now turning out to be a home run on the basis of being pretty selectable, the criteria going in, strong execution when we acquire it. And now we've got a business that in the long term will be a superb ITW business.\nSabrina Abrams : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. I was hoping this might be one call I could escape AI data centers, but I think they got dragged in minutes ago.\nChris O'Hairlehy: We didn't bring it up, just for the record.\nJulian Mitchell: No, totally fair, totally fair. If we think just for a second, Michael or Chris about sort of inventories, just curious about your own levels and those of your customers or distributor partners, I think your own inventories dollar wise are pretty steady sequentially this year, but still running a little bit high as a share of revenue versus pre-COVID, maybe 11% versus something like 8% five years ago, six years ago. Is 11 sort of a good run rate from here? Or no, it should come down over time, but gradually just as the revenue picks up? And then how do you assess the sort of state of play of inventories that your distributors and customers, so they kind of generally right size now after two years of being leaned out?\nMichael Larsen: Yeah, I think that's right, Julian. Let's start there. The channel, I think those inventory levels have normalized. Our channel doesn't carry a lot of inventory because they're used to our place in order today, we ship you tomorrow. So with that level of customer service, there's no incentive for them to carry a lot of inventory. And then I would kind of pivoting to our own inventory levels. I'd say just more broadly on free cash flow, it was good to be above 100% again here in the third quarter, which is more aligned with the typical levels that you expect from us. And we expect to continue to make meaningful progress again in Q4 on the inventory and free cash flow. So we've talked about our focus on reducing our months on hand, getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels of about 2.5 months on hand, we're about 3. The difference here is in that $300 million to $400 million range of additional inventory that we'll expect to come out Q4 and then into next year. So we view that, I think the same way you do as a big opportunity to drive above average free cash flow for the company here in the near term. I think we've made some progress down, I think it's 6% year-over-year. Last year, inventories came down 17%, but we can certainly, we agree that there's some opportunity here and we want to do that, reduce inventory levels while maintaining those customer service levels, which is where I started because we believe they're a real competitive advantage for us. And the last thing I'll say is all of this, the fact that maybe we're a little bit lower this year free cash flow than in prior years, doesn't impact our capital allocation plans. We're investing in our businesses for growth and productivity, all new products are funded. We raised the dividend 7% in August and we're buying back 1.5 billion of our shares this year as planned. But I agree with you that there's definitely an opportunity here and we're going after it in every one of our 84 divisions in a meaningful way here.\nJulian Mitchell: That's a very good answer. Thank you. And then just my follow-up, sort of thinking again about that question of customer-backed innovation and driving up organic growth and market share. I think as you said, sort of R&D to sales is pretty steady. So maybe flattish dollars year-to-date versus last year. CapEx was sort of flattish year-to-date, down somewhat in the third quarter year-on-year. So when we're thinking about kind of the levers of getting that market share up, and it's in the context of a sort of decentralized operating structure where you're sort of letting the businesses ask you for R&D dollars. Maybe give us one or two examples of how you're driving up that share? How does that interplay work between trying to get more dollars of spend into different businesses with a high return versus that kind of decentralized nature? Any sort of examples around that might be helpful for me, at least.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yes. I would say Julian, that our spend in innovation has been rising over the last two or three years. I mean, we've seen double-digit increases in spend on the basis of pretty focused investments in strategic marketing and innovation across the portfolio. But a lot of this goes beyond spend. It really comes down to a much higher level of, I think, leadership time and focus. As I said, we're already doubling down on this in the same way we doubled down on 80-20 front-to-back last time. And we've been investing in building capability really for the last few years here. And I think you can see that in the increased yield that we've had since, like \u201817 \u201818, where it was about 1%, to now where it's about 2%. So we're already seeing the investments. And this capability build is both in our divisions, but also at our segment level to really enable our businesses to be able to achieve this. A lot of this comes down to the quality of the framework. We have a lot of great innovation practice across the company. We've codified that, and now we want to make sure that it resides everywhere in every division in ITW. And this is the exact same approach that we took on 80-20 front-to-back that was very successful in the last phase of our strategy. So we're on a great path here. We've already seen the outcomes. We expect to see a continuous improvement in CBI contribution every year from here on out, starting in 2025.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thanks, Chris.\nChris O'Hairlehy: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones at Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Farley : Hey, good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. I wanted to follow up on Welding. What impact do you believe the upcoming election is having on the sentiment in the underlying industrial market? Do we potentially see an improvement in \u201825, maybe post-election?\nMichael Larsen: Maybe I'll... Do you want to jump in?\nChris O'Hairlehy: Yes. So at a high level, Nathan, I would say, look we're a short-sighted company. So we're kind of reading and reacting to what's in front of us. There's nothing overt or specific that we're hearing from our customers related to the election, I would say.\nMichael Larsen: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think there's some, other than anecdotes, there's really nothing specific that we can point to. And I think that we'll kind of leave it at that.\nAdam Farley : Okay. Fair enough. I know it wasn't called out in the press release, but was there any hurricane impact at your sites or maybe at your customer sites?\nMichael Larsen: No, not at our sites. I can't speak for all of our, thousands of customers in those affected regions, but there was no impact on our facilities or, and thank God, on our people in those areas.\nAdam Farley : Okay. Thank you for taking my question.\nMichael Larsen: All right. Thanks, Adam.\nErin Linnihan: And Kathleen, I think that ends the call for us today.\nOperator: Yes. There are no further questions at this time. Thank you, everyone, for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, and as expected, the third quarter ended up looking a lot like the second quarter with continued strong operational execution in a moderating demand environment. Total revenue declined 1.6%, with organic revenue down 1.4%. Foreign currency translation reduced revenue by 0.4%, and acquisitions increased revenue by 0.2%. On a geographic basis, organic revenue declined about 3% in North America. Europe was down 0.5% and Asia Pacific was down 1% with China, essentially flat. In this environment, the ITW team continued to focus and execute well on the things that we can control as evidenced by six of our seven segments, expanding operating margin, driven primarily by enterprise initiatives that contributed between 70 and a 180 basis points to each segment and a 130 basis points at the enterprise level. Third quarter operating margin was 26.5%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter and flat with the prior year due to a tough comparison. As you may recall, last year's Q3 margin of 26.5% expanded 200 basis points compared to 2022 due in part to the favorable impact of a few corporate items that we discussed on the call last year, including a one-time insurance recovery. Excluding those one-time items last year and looking just at segment operating margin, which is included in the press release tables, our segment operating margin increased by a 110 basis points compared to the prior year, which is more in line with our typical margin expansion on a quarterly basis. GAAP EPS of $3.91 was up 53% and included a $1.26 gain from the divestiture of our non-controlling equity interest in Wilsonart. Excluding this gain, EPS of $2.65 was an increase of 4% year-over-year. I want to spend a minute on a previously announced Wilsonart divestiture. The proceeds from the transaction, net of transaction costs were approximately $395 million, which we reduced to reduce our commercial paper balance. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $363 million and income taxes on the gain were more than offset by a discrete tax benefit of a $107 million related to the utilization of capital loss carry forwards, which resulted in the favorable GAAP EPS impact of a $1.26. Free cash flow was $783 million, which was 102% conversion of adjusted net income. And as Chris mentioned in the third quarter, we raised our dividend by 7% to an annualized payout of $6 per share, which marks our 61st consecutive year of increases. And as planned, we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter of 14.9% was below our typical tax rate in the 24% to 25% range. As you can see from the reconciliation, the press release, the tax rate was favorably impacted by several discrete items in the quarter, including the Wilsonart transaction. Excluding these discrete items, our core tax rate was 23.7%. So in summary, the third quarter looked a lot like the second quarter with moderating, but also stable demand and solid operating margin and profitability performance as we continue to focus and execute well on the things that we can control. Please turn to Slide 4, for a look at our year-to-date segment margin performance. And as you can see from the table on the left side, six of our seven segments have expanded their already best-in-class margins year-to-date and three segments by more than a 100 basis points. Food Equipment is a bit of an outlier due to the growth investments in our service business and specifically the near-term inefficiencies associated with on-boarding of new service technicians to support accelerated organic growth in this business. This margin headwind is now largely behind the Food Equipment segment as evidenced by a 110 basis points of margin improvement in the third quarter. Total company margin is up a 180 basis points, which in fairness includes a 100 basis points from the one-time LIFO adjustment in the first quarter, but still solid performance in the current environment. Moving to the segments and starting with Automotive OEM, organic revenue declined 3% in the third quarter as industry build rates continue to come down. North America was down 6% as the D3 customer bills were down 9%. Europe was down 5% and China was down 2%. Compared to the automobile industry build data, the segment has outperformed bills by about 200 basis points year-to-date and we expect similar outperformance in the fourth quarter. The segment also delivered solid operating margin performance of 19.4% and 50 basis points increase despite lower volume and we expect more progress in the fourth quarter and next year as we continue to work towards our long-term goal of achieving operating margins in the low to mid 20s by 2026 in this segment. Turn to Slide 5, organic revenue in Food Equipment was about flat against a tough comp of plus 6% last year as equipment was down 4% and offset by service, which grew 7%. Regionally, North America was down 2% after being up 10% last year with institutional sales about flat as healthcare was up mid single digits and restaurants were down about 10%. International was solid up 3% with the service business up 8% and Europe up 4%. Operating margin improved a 110 basis points due to the service margin normalizing and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect margin to continue to improve as we go through the year. Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down only 1% after being down 3% last quarter with stable demand in Semiconductor Electronics and CapEx sensitive end markets. While Test & Measurement was down 3%, Electronics was up 1% in the quarter after being down 3% last quarter. And this marked the first quarter of positive growth in Electronics since the end of 2022. And we're beginning to see increased Semiconductor customer activity suggesting that perhaps we are near a bottom for this market. As we've discussed before, we remain very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this space when the inevitable recovery does happen. Operating margin expanded by 190 basis points in the quarter to 25.7%. Moving on to Slide 6, Welding's organic revenue declined 1%, a meaningful improvement from being down 5% in the second quarter as both Equipment and Consumables revenue declined 1%. Both America revenue was down 2% but International was up 6% with solid growth in Europe and China. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, the Welding team was planning on a solid contribution to the top line from the launch of new products, which in the third quarter resulted in a 3% plus contribution to growth. And this is just one of many examples inside the company that illustrates how continued progress on CBI as Chris was talking about, gives our segments the ability to gain share and outgrow their end markets. Operating margin of 32.3% was a third quarter record for the Welding segment. Polymers & Fluids, organic revenue grew 1% with Polymers up 10% due to international strength and Fluids was up 3%. Automotive aftermarket, which as you know, is tied closely to consumer discretionary spending was down 3% in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 5% and International grew 11% with Europe again showing solid demand. Turn to Slide 7, organic revenue in Construction products was down 9% as Construction end markets took a sizable step back from the second quarter with new housing starts down 10% on an annualized basis as compared to down 6% in the second quarter. As a result, North America declined 10% with residential down 12% and commercial construction down 7%. Europe was down 4% and Australia and New Zealand was down 11%. Despite the lower volume, operating margin of 30.2% was a record for the segment with another significant contribution from enterprise initiatives. Finally, specialty products had a solid quarter with organic revenue growth of 6% with strength across the portfolio as both Equipment and Consumables were up 6%. North America was up 8% and International grew 2%. The 6% growth rate for the segment included about 200 basis points of PLS or product line simplification in the quarter. As we continue to make progress on repositioning some of our specialty products divisions for consistent above market organic growth. We expect about 300 basis points of PLS in the fourth quarter and that the segment will be flat to up low single digits for the full year. Operating margin expanded 330 basis points to 31.1%, a third quarter record for the segment with strong contributions from operating leverage and enterprise initiatives. Moving to Slide 8 and our updated full year 2024 guidance. As you've seen all year, the ITW team continues to execute at a very high level and find a way to leverage our business model and high quality diversified business portfolio to deliver solid operational and financial results in a challenging demand environment. Looking ahead at the fourth quarter, we do not expect the near-term demand environment to improve, and as usual, our guidance is based on current levels of demand, seasonally adjusted, and foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, we're maintaining our previous projection for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for the year. We're also maintaining our full year operating margin guidance, which is projected to be between 26.5% and 27%, an improvement of a 165 basis points at the midpoint, with enterprise initiatives contributing more than a 100 basis points. As you saw in the press release, we incorporated the impact of the Wilsonart divestiture gain and a lower projected effective tax rate of 21.5% for the full year into our EPS guidance, as we raised GAAP EPS guidance from a range of $10.30 to $10.40 per share by $1.33 to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73 per share. Excluding the Wilsonart gain, EPS range is $10.37 to $10.47 per share, or $10.42 at the midpoint. So, in summary, while the overall demand environment remains pretty uncertain and challenging in the near term, we remain laser-focused on leveraging ITW's unique strengths and capabilities to optimize our ability to deliver differentiated performance over the long term. And with that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. Yeah, sure, Jeff. So, let me start by saying, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. And as you were trying to do based on our year-to-date performance and our full year guidance, you can get pretty close in terms of figuring out Q4. But maybe let me try to help out a little bit. So, I'd say at a high level, Q4 looks a lot like Q3. Typically what we see from a seasonality standpoint is a sequential improvement in revenues from Q3 to Q4, about a point to a point and a half. And that's going all the way back to 2017. So, at current run rates, typically we're up a point to a point and a half. We do have easier comparisons in the fourth quarter. And for what it's worth, there's also an extra shipping day in the quarter. So, you add all that up, we get to about flat revenues on a year-over-year basis. We expect, again, our typical margin improvement of about 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So, that is a slight decline from Q3 to Q4, which is kind of the typical seasonality. And the main driver here remains another strong contribution from the enterprise initiatives. And then factoring in a more kind of normal tax rate for us in that 24%, 25% range. And you get to EPS at the midpoint. And I'm just doing the math. I'm not giving guidance that's in that 2.51 range for the fourth quarter. So, I'll just add, while we're talking about the fourth quarter, we do expect a strong quarter, again, from a free cash flow standpoint. And we're projecting some meaningful improvement on our inventory levels in the fourth quarter, which is not easy in the current demand environment. So, hopefully that's helpful, Jeff. So, let me just add a little bit of color. So, I think if you look at the third quarter, about flat with Auto, as we said down 2. And certainly some challenges also in Test & Measurement down single-digit, low single-digits, same in Food Equipment. So, strength in Welding which is tied to oil and gas, LNG, transportation, and also some strength in our specialty products, appliance business. So, you all add up, you get to about flat for the quarter, up 6% year-to-date. We think in the fourth quarter, as Chris said, we'll see a pickup on the Automotive side, continued strength in Welding. And so, Q4 should be kind of flat, maybe up a low single-digit and the full year up in that 5% range. So, as we sit here today, I think we feel pretty good about China. I know there's a lot of talk about stimulus and so forth. We haven't seen a lot of that yet. So, if that's still to come, that would certainly be helpful. But as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about China. Sure. Morning. And I think the only thing I'd add is just, Jamie, if you look at the margin performance, you can see what happens at ITW, and this is not unique to Specialty when you get a little bit of operating leverage, suddenly you're in that 31% plus range, which is certainly very encouraging and gives us, as we said earlier, a lot of conviction and ability to get to that 30% target at the enterprise level with three segments this quarter above 30%, which is, that's the first time that's happened. And again, that's with very little operating leverage. So that's certainly really, really gives -- pretty encouraging as we look also into next year in terms of the momentum around the margin performance of the company continues. Morning, Andy. Well, I think, Andy, we're talking about our most interest rate-sensitive segment. So, I think what we're seeing here is a market that's down in the low teens. I pointed in the script to kind of the housing start numbers being down 10% on an annualized basis, which kind of mirrors our business in North America. Maybe we're a little bit better than that. And then we're seeing similar type of softness in Australia, New Zealand, which is a meaningful part of our business. So, I think at this point, it's really too early to point to any signs or indicators that things are getting better here. Over the long term, certainly the fact that interest rates appear to be coming down has been a leading indicator, but we've not seen anything to suggest that things are picking up in Construction at this point. So, and I'll just say in that context, I think it's even more remarkable that we -- the team put up margins of 30% plus here in the third quarter in an environment that's certainly pretty challenging. So, and about as challenging as we see across the company at this point in the cycle. Sure. See you, Andy. Yeah, let me do price cost and then, Chris, if you can add some commentary on Enterprise initiatives. But I think at this point Tami, as we said before, price cost has kind of normalized. This is no longer a distraction as it was back in \u201821, \u201822, and \u201823. At this point, price dollars are ahead of costs on a dollar basis and modestly positive from a margin standpoint. Now, that, just to be clear, doesn't mean that costs are coming down, particularly Electronics, Energy in certain geographies, components that have labor content. We're also seeing it in our employee costs, health and welfare, and other pockets, overhead costs such as just to point out, rental expense, leases, software licenses. So, we have to continue to be very diligent in this area and make sure that we get price to offset all of these pressures. But overall, nothing significant to point to on the price cost equation. And then maybe on the Enterprise initiatives, Chris. Yeah. And just from a numerical standpoint, I'd say, R&D spend the way we've defined it here over the years is about 1.8% of sales. So as sales grow, so will the R&D dollar spend. And we don't foresee any significant change in that as we go forward. As Chris said, we really fund every project that our divisions put forward and that's important to them. And so that's how we approach it here. Really in terms of it's an outcome of this process that Chris described. Yeah, I think that's right, Julian. Let's start there. The channel, I think those inventory levels have normalized. Our channel doesn't carry a lot of inventory because they're used to our place in order today, we ship you tomorrow. So with that level of customer service, there's no incentive for them to carry a lot of inventory. And then I would kind of pivoting to our own inventory levels. I'd say just more broadly on free cash flow, it was good to be above 100% again here in the third quarter, which is more aligned with the typical levels that you expect from us. And we expect to continue to make meaningful progress again in Q4 on the inventory and free cash flow. So we've talked about our focus on reducing our months on hand, getting back to kind of pre-COVID levels of about 2.5 months on hand, we're about 3. The difference here is in that $300 million to $400 million range of additional inventory that we'll expect to come out Q4 and then into next year. So we view that, I think the same way you do as a big opportunity to drive above average free cash flow for the company here in the near term. I think we've made some progress down, I think it's 6% year-over-year. Last year, inventories came down 17%, but we can certainly, we agree that there's some opportunity here and we want to do that, reduce inventory levels while maintaining those customer service levels, which is where I started because we believe they're a real competitive advantage for us. And the last thing I'll say is all of this, the fact that maybe we're a little bit lower this year free cash flow than in prior years, doesn't impact our capital allocation plans. We're investing in our businesses for growth and productivity, all new products are funded. We raised the dividend 7% in August and we're buying back 1.5 billion of our shares this year as planned. But I agree with you that there's definitely an opportunity here and we're going after it in every one of our 84 divisions in a meaningful way here. Maybe I'll... Do you want to jump in? Yeah, I would agree with that. I think there's some, other than anecdotes, there's really nothing specific that we can point to. And I think that we'll kind of leave it at that. No, not at our sites. I can't speak for all of our, thousands of customers in those affected regions, but there was no impact on our facilities or, and thank God, on our people in those areas. All right. Thanks, Adam."

            "name": "Chris O'Hairlehy",
            "content": "Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release this morning, during the third quarter, the market demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio with further softness in the Automotive and Construction markets. Overall, third quarter revenues came in approximately half a percentage point, or $25 million below what they would have been had demand held at the level we were seeing exiting the second quarter. That said, the slowdown in Q3 was less than in Q2, where revenue came in approximately one percentage point, or $50 million below run rate. As a result, third quarter organic revenue declined 1%, with five segments down year-over-year, partially offset by growth in two segments. This 1% revenue decline compares to our end markets, which we believe were down in the low to mid-single digits. As we have all year, the ITW team continued to successfully navigate and overcome these market challenges with strong operational execution. Those efforts resulted in operating income of $1.05 billion with operating margin of 26.5%, which included a 130 basis point contribution from enterprise initiatives. With little operating leverage, six of seven segments still increased operating margin, resulting in segment operating margin expansion of a 110 basis points. EPS grew 4% to $2.65, excluding the gains from the divestiture that Michael will review in more detail. The continued contribution from enterprise initiatives, regardless of volume, speaks to the power and resilience of our business model. And it is notable that for the first time, three of our segments delivered operating margin above 30% in the quarter. And we are well on our way to achieve our goal of 30% operating margin for the company by 2030. Our continued focused execution and typical operational excellence have enabled ITW to effectively counter persistent market headwinds and achieve increased profitability, where we continue to invest to maximize growth and performance over the long term. Consistent with our long-term commitment to return surplus capital to shareholders by an attractive and growing dividend, on August 2nd, we announced our 61st consecutive dividend increase, raising our dividend by 7%. And year-to-date, we have repurchased more than $1.1 billion of our outstanding shares. Today, we are raising our full-year GAAP EPS guidance by a $1.33, from a range of $10.30 to $10.40, to a new range of $11.63 to $11.73, to incorporate the impact of the divestiture gain and a lower projected tax rate for the full year. Based on current levels of demand exiting Q3, we are maintaining our previous operational guidance for revenue and organic growth to be approximately flat for the year and our operating margin to be between 26.5% and 27%. While the ITW team is in a commendable job managing the short-term challenges this year, perhaps more importantly, we continue to deliver solid progress on our next phase enterprise strategy priorities. As we outlined to you a year ago, the central focus of the next phase of our enterprise strategy is to elevate high-quality organic growth and customer-backed innovation as key ITW differentiators, on par with our best-in-class operational capabilities and financial performance. This quarter, we made further progress in our journey to achieve this strategic goal. We believe that customer-backed innovation, or CBI as we call it, is the most impactful driver of our ability to consistently grow revenue above market. In essence, the customer-backed innovation revenue of today fuels the ability to drive market penetration and share gain in the future. Over the past few years, we've made progress on expanding our revenue from CBI from less than a percent in 2017 to approximately 2% today. And at our September Leadership conference, we launched the next phase CBI framework for our 84 divisions around the world. Just as we successfully focused the entire organization on 80-20 front-to-back over a decade ago, we are now doubling down on customer-backed innovation. And I, for one, can feel the energy, excitement, and momentum from our team as they implement this strategy at each division. With our continued laser focus on our typical do-what-we-say execution, it is with strong conviction that I know we will build above-market organic growth fueled by customer-backed innovation into a defining ITW strength. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and dedication in serving our customers with excellence and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our Q3 performance and full year guidance in more detail. Michael. Good morning, Jeff. Yeah. So, I think from the Auto China standpoint, Jeff, I mean, China builds this year in Auto are expected to be up 1%. We expect to be up 8%. So, our businesses continue to penetrate very successfully in China. And EV obviously is a large part of the story, given the fact that China is producing about 60% of the world's EVs. But we're making very strong penetration gains in EV in China, as evidenced by the market growth. In Auto in general, we expect to be up a couple of percent against flat builds this year. Sorry, flat versus negative down 2% -- up 2%, I would say as we have been kind of historically would expect to be on into the future. And that that strength has been pretty much across all three geographies, Europe, North America, but especially in China. Okay. Thank you for the color. Yeah. So, Jamie, I think a good part of the Specialty story is strengthened Aerospace. We have one particular business that's focused on Aerospace. And again, we saw about 30% growth in that business this quarter. We saw, I'd say, pockets of strong demand I think throughout the segment, areas like consumer packaging. Consumer packaging equipment were also pretty strong. And we did have some favorable comms in Specialty versus last year. But even with all that, we expect Specialty to be up kind of low single-digits for the full year. And it's really strengthening our conviction that on the basis of the strategic portfolio positioning we've been doing in that segment, which involves some, as we said before, some product line pruning throughout the segment which is certainly choppy, and it's creating a bit of a drag, as Michael just indicated a couple of 100 basis points this year. But what it does, what this is all doing is really strengthening our conviction that the objective to make Specialty a 4% grower in the long term is well on track here. And everything we've seen this year gives us a strong belief that we can do that. Not at all, Jamie. I think if we go back to Investor Day last year, we were very overt in our comments that we felt that all seven of our segments have the capability to grow 4% plus. And we certainly believe that today, and even more so. With respect to CBI, the CBI opportunity, I think is very relevant across all seven segments. And we're at different points in terms of the development around that. But I think, everything we've seen would indicate that all these segments have a pretty fertile innovation environment, have critical customer pain points that are there to be solved. We're certainly mobilizing the company around that in very similar way to where we mobilized the company around front to back 10, 12 years ago. With the same kind of capability build and investment in resources, a much higher level of leadership kind of time and focus around CBI, we have lots of great innovation practice across the company. And we've now codified that into a very effective innovation framework. And this is the exact same approach that we took on 80-20 front to back, which as we know was very successful. And we've seen this. I mean, this is not something that's starting today. We've been working on this for a couple of years now in terms of focused investment in resources and CBI. And we've seen that in terms of the improvement in yield that we've seen from CBI. So there is a lot of conviction here that the yield improvement from one to somewhere over two today will be north of three in due course. And we have a very clear path to doing that. And like I said, that's going to result in improvements in every one of our segments on the ultimate journey to having every one of these segments growing at 4 plus. Yeah, I think based on the customer conversations that we are having, we're starting to see a bottoming, particularly in Semi. Just to characterize, Semi is about 15% of Test & Measurement. It represents a couple of percent of ITW's revenues. So just to put it in context, but there's no doubt that we saw a bottoming and slight improvement in this, I think, in the third quarter. Electronics, similarly, had been down for quite a while, significantly down earlier this year. It's starting to bottom there as well. And then I think an important kind of bellwether for us, the Instron business, which is a critical business within Test & Measurement, had very solid growth during the quarter. And that's certainly encouraging as we look here for the balance of the year and on into next year. Good morning, team Tami. Sure. So Tami as we said, Enterprise initiatives continue to be an important contributor to results. And how we think about these initiatives is that these initiatives, they are independent of volume and they're really an outcome of the continuous improvement mindset that's very much part of ITW's DNA, I would say. And this is what really drives this divisional kind of quality of practice and 80-20 front to back in sourcing. And typically very bottom-up initiatives driven by our talented people in our divisions at a very granular level. Most of these initiatives are in the couple of hundred thousand dollar range and in terms of individually. But when you have 84 divisions, these add up to a very meaningful number. So, the divisions have a lot of visibility, ownership, and accountability on these. And the track record has indicated over the last 11 years, our divisions are going to do what they say when they forecast these. So, our confidence on enterprise initiatives going forward, that this will continue really is an outcome of this strong ownership and accountability that resides in our divisions and the strong continuous improvement mindset that I refer to that's really hardwired into our divisions at this point. And the case of 80-20, as we know, this is the gift that keeps on giving. So, with that we certainly see an ongoing contribution from Enterprise initiatives going forward, including in 2025. And this is a fundamental part of how we drive differentiated execution in any environment. So, I think as it relates to data centers specifically, we have standard characteristics of businesses that we would pursue for acquisition based on sustainable differentiation. So, if an opportunity came along that was data center related and met our normal criteria, then we'd be all in based on the characteristics of having a business that could grow above market, that we could leverage our business model, and we could acquire at the right valuation. And that applies to everything, not just data centers. So, we don't have a specific focus on data centers. We kind of look at all these things on an equal basis in terms of their long-term attractiveness for us. Well, I think, Joe, I'd start by saying we're not economists and we're not trying to predict the impossible here, which is where the economy is going. We are, as you said much more short cycle. Our divisions do a great job kind of reading and reacting to what's going on in their respective end markets. I would just make a broader comment based on what we saw in the third quarter, which is some stability in the more CapEx sensitive businesses. So, I'll point to Welding, as I mentioned. I'll point to Test & Measurement, including our Instron business, which was up in a meaningful way on a year-to-year basis and improved kind of quoting and order activity. So, maybe that squares with what you were talking about. And then the softness in Q3 was really much more tied to Construction and Automotive production, specifically with our customers, with the T3 customers. But certainly some stability in CapEx, and we'll see where it goes from here. We're modeling based on current run rates. So, based on what we're seeing in our businesses today, and we'll see how it all plays out as we go into 2025. And interest rates maybe -- would be a little helpful if they came lower for sure. So... Yeah, so for us spend in R&D or innovation is largely an outcome of basically request more divisions. Basically, we fund all the good projects. We've been making over the last three or four years, making very focused investments in areas like innovation and strategic marketing. We expect that to continue. But if that number was to go up, that's not a problem for us. It's really an outcome of funding all these good projects. And our teams are really focused on their 80 opportunities in their markets with their key customers. And whatever we spend in R&D typically is an outcome of that. And we're very happy to spend it because it's typically money well spent on the degree of focus that our businesses have. Sure. Yeah, so we're very much on track to do 3% plus inline with our target by 2030, if not indeed before that, based on the progress that we are making. We're at varying levels of accomplishment currently across our seven segments. I would point to Welding as an example. This year, as we've highlighted, Michael highlighted his commentary, our Welding business is suffering some significant end market challenges, but we're getting north of 3% contribution CBI in Welding. As we forecasted at the beginning of the year, several new product launches. So Welding will be one, Test & Measurement, Electronics, obviously an area of significant attractiveness around innovation in the context of what's going on in those markets. New materials being developed, all of which require to be tested, increasing stringency in areas like R&D and in quality control, all of which requires more and more sophisticated testing equipment which really speaks to our competitive advantages. And then the other one I'd highlight is Food Equipment. Food Equipment, sustainability in areas of energy savings, water savings is a very fertile innovation environment, and we've managed to leverage that for several years. And the other one, of course, I point to is Auto. Auto, given the disruptive nature of Auto right now, particularly with the increased penetration of electric vehicles, provides enormous opportunity for innovation. And we're capitalizing on that as evidenced by the fact that our electric vehicle penetration into electric vehicles is higher than the market average. So, I feel pretty good about all seven segments, but those are the four that I'd highlight right now. Yes, I would say our posture on M&A hasn't changed. And since we outlined this at the leadership conference. And we've got a pretty disciplined portfolio strategy. We believe clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy. And so it's a case of us finding the right opportunities. And for us, we're focused on high quality acquisitions that extend our ability to grow at a minimum 4% over the long term. That's the first criteria. The second criteria we look at is that we're able to leverage the business model to improve margins and then obviously acquiring the business at the right valuation to provide a decent long term return for our shareholders. We review opportunities on an ongoing basis, but we're very selective on the basis of these criteria. And if I could point to MTS as an example, MTS was an example of an acquisition we did 2.5 years ago, which fulfilled all of our criteria. And thanks to a very strong execution. That's now turning out to be a home run on the basis of being pretty selectable, the criteria going in, strong execution when we acquire it. And now we've got a business that in the long term will be a superb ITW business. We didn't bring it up, just for the record. Yes. I would say Julian, that our spend in innovation has been rising over the last two or three years. I mean, we've seen double-digit increases in spend on the basis of pretty focused investments in strategic marketing and innovation across the portfolio. But a lot of this goes beyond spend. It really comes down to a much higher level of, I think, leadership time and focus. As I said, we're already doubling down on this in the same way we doubled down on 80-20 front-to-back last time. And we've been investing in building capability really for the last few years here. And I think you can see that in the increased yield that we've had since, like \u201817 \u201818, where it was about 1%, to now where it's about 2%. So we're already seeing the investments. And this capability build is both in our divisions, but also at our segment level to really enable our businesses to be able to achieve this. A lot of this comes down to the quality of the framework. We have a lot of great innovation practice across the company. We've codified that, and now we want to make sure that it resides everywhere in every division in ITW. And this is the exact same approach that we took on 80-20 front-to-back that was very successful in the last phase of our strategy. So we're on a great path here. We've already seen the outcomes. We expect to see a continuous improvement in CBI contribution every year from here on out, starting in 2025. Sure. Thank you. Yes. So at a high level, Nathan, I would say, look we're a short-sighted company. So we're kind of reading and reacting to what's in front of us. There's nothing overt or specific that we're hearing from our customers related to the election, I would say."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nErin Linnihan: Thank you, Audra. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's second quarter 2024 conference call. Today, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's second quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for full year 2024. Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O'Herlihy. Chris?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release this morning, during the second quarter, the short cycle demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio. At the total company level, second quarter revenues came in approximately 1 percentage point, or $50 million below what they would have been had demand held at the level we were seeing exiting the first quarter. Second quarter organic revenue was down in three segments with declines year-over-year in CapEx-related products such as welding, test and measurement and construction. These declines were offset by revenue growth in four segments resulting in overall flat organic growth year-over-year at the total company level as compared to our end markets which we believe were down in the low single digits. As usual, as the quarter progressed, the ITW team executed well on all the elements within our control. As evidenced by record second quarter operating margin, which improved by 140 basis points, 26.2%, supported by 140 basis points of benefit from enterprise initiatives. Operating income grew 4.5% to a second quarter record of $1.05 billion and GAAP EPS came in at $2.54, up from $2.48 last year. As per our normal practice, we are adjusting our full year guidance in line with demand levels in our businesses as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 projected through the remainder of the year results in about flat organic revenue for the full year. The moderating demand is partially offset by stronger margin performance and we are raising our margin guidance to 26.5% to 27%. Factoring in both of these elements, lower market demand and stronger margin performance, we are lowering the midpoint of our EPS guidance by 1% as we narrow the range to $10.30 to $10.40. While the combination of moderating manufacturing CapEx demand and lower automotive bill forecasts for the second half has us operating in a challenging near-term environment, we will continue to drive our usual high-quality execution on all the elements within our control, while remaining focused on managing and investing to maximize the company's growth and performance over the long-term, as we build above market organic growth fueled by customer-backed innovation into a core ITW strength. In this regard, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making on customer-backed innovation in each of our divisions. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and for their dedication to serving our customers with excellence and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail, as well as our updated full year guidance. Michael?\nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, revenue declined 1% with organic revenue down 0.1%, essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight improvement from being down 0.6% in Q1. As Chris said, demand moderated sequentially as total company revenues grew 2% from the first quarter to the second quarter, a point below our historical run rate growth of 3%. Faced with moderating demand, the ITW team, as usual, did a great job in terms of reading and reacting to the environment and delivered record margin and profitability performance in the second quarter, as evidenced by 4.5% operating income growth and operating margins of 26.2%, an improvement of 140 basis points as enterprise initiatives were once again the largest margin and profitability driver contributing 140 basis points this quarter with more to come in the second half. GAAP EPS of $2.54 increased 2% or 5% excluding a 2023 one-time tax item. Our free cash flow was $571 million which was a 75% conversion of net income, slightly below our historical conversion in the 80% range, as we continue to focus on reducing our inventory months on hand to pre-pandemic levels without impacting customer service levels. We repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter as planned, and the effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 21.4% in the prior year, which lowered EPS by $0.10. In addition, foreign currency translation was approximately a $0.05 headwind year-over-year. In summary, strong execution and Q2 results as the impact of a moderating short cycle demand environment was offset by strong margin and profitability performance. Please turn to Slide 4 for a look at organic growth by geography. The 2% decline in North America was an improvement over the first quarter's 3% decline. Europe grew 1% and Asia Pacific grew 3%, with China up 5%. Moving on to segment results, the Automotive OEM segment delivered flat organic growth in the second quarter against a tough comparison of plus 16% in the year-ago quarter. North America was down 4%, Europe was down 2%, and China was up 7%. In the first half, Automotive Builds were flat, and our Automotive OEM segment grew 2% above market. For the full year, we continue to expect solid above-market growth with our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued outgrowth in China. In our guidance, we have now factored in the most recent automotive build projections, which have declined to negative 2% for the full year. As you may recall, when we issued our initial guidance in February, Automotive Builds were expected to be flat for the year. On a positive note, the segment delivered strong operating margin performance of 19.4%, a 260 basis points improvement, as we continue to work towards our goal of achieving operating margins in the low to mid-20s by 2026. Turn to Slide 5, Food Equipment organic revenue grew 2.5% against a comparison of plus 7% in the second quarter of last year. Equipment grew 1% and service grew 5% against a comparison of plus 16% last year. By region, North America increased 2% with service up 3%. Organic growth in the institutional market was up mid single digits, and the retail market was up high single digits. International revenue was up 3.5% led by Europe. As we talked about last quarter, the current margin performance reflects the fact that we're making focused capacity investments in the first half of 2024 to support and accelerate continued above-market organic growth in our very attractive service business. Looking forward, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially as we go through the year. Turning to Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down 3% with continued softness in semiconductor, electronics, and CapEx-sensitive end markets. Both Test & Measurement and Electronics were down 3% in the quarter. Moving on to Slide 6, Welding was down 5% in Q2, as Equipment declined 5% and consumables were down 3%. By region, North America declined 6% with industrial sales down 7% and the commercial side down 6%. International grew 3% with some strength in Europe. Operating margin was 32.9% with a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue in Polymers & Fluids increased 3%, led by Polymers up 10%, and Fluids was up 4%. Automotive aftermarket was down 2% in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 4% and international grew 13%. Operating margin of 28.2% improved more than 200 basis points. Turn to Slide 7. Demand trends in construction products continue to be challenging on a global basis as organic revenue declined 4% in Q2 in a market that we believe is down in the mid to high single digits. North America was down 2% as the residential and renovation business was down 2% and commercial was down 9%. International markets remain soft as Europe was down 7% and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. Finally, specialty products had a strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7% due to significant strength in our aerospace equipment division as well as pockets of increased demand across our portfolio. As a result, international was up 10% and North America was up 5%. As previously discussed, results can be a bit choppy as we continue to work to reposition the Specialty segment for consistent above-market organic growth, including strategic portfolio work and more significant product line simplification, which included 230 basis points in Q2. Operating margin improved 590 basis points to 31.9% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and operating leverage. With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2024 guidance. Despite a challenging first half macro demand environment, the ITW team found a way to deliver solid operational and financial results. And excluding one-time items, we grew operating income 4% in the first half as margins improved by 130 basis points to 25.8% with 140 basis points from enterprise initiatives. GAAP EPS was up 10% -- up 5% excluding one-time items. Looking ahead to the second half in our updated guidance, we do not expect the short cycle demand environment to improve. Per usual process, we are adjusting our full year guidance in line with conditions on the ground as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 adjusted for typical seasonality and the most recent automotive build forecast projected through the remainder of the year would result in approximately flat organic growth for the year in markets that we believe are down in the low single digits. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 1% to 3% and impacts EPS by approximately $0.25. The lower top line guidance is partially offset by stronger margin and profitability performance, which is expected to continue into the second half, including a significant contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. As a result, we raised margin guidance to 26.5% to 27% as we continue to make solid progress towards our goal of 30% operating margin by 2030. The higher margins impact EPS favorably by about $0.10. The net of these two factors, as you saw this morning, is that we lowered the top end of the range of our full-year GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $10.30 to $10.40, which is a reduction of $0.15 or 1% at the midpoint from $10.50 to $10.35 with 6 months to go in the year. To wrap things up, we delivered a solid Q2 and first half in a challenging demand environment, and we've updated our full year guidance per usual process to reflect current levels of demand. Given the strength of our competitive advantages, the resilience of the ITW business model, and our diversified high-quality portfolio, we're well-positioned for whatever economic conditions emerged through the second half of the year. With that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you.\nErin Linnihan: Thank you. Audra, will you please open the line for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andy Kaplowitz at Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning. Chris and Michael, you continue to have unusually strong results in specialty products in Q2 after I think you said in Q1 that it was a bit unusual and Q2 would normalize. I know you mentioned aerospace. I don't think I've heard that particular business mentioned before. So could you give us more color on what's going on there and what is the probability that segment could continue to outperform?\nMichael Larsen: Yes. So, Andy, we've had a -- as you've outlined, a very solid half one here in specialty. There's a few different things going on. I think strength in aerospace has been a feature throughout the first half. There's some other pockets of strong demand elsewhere. Obviously, we had favorable comps in specialty and we've also benefited from the timing of some orders, particularly in Q1 for some of our European equipment businesses. This is a segment that we've got some strategic portfolio repositioning going on. A bit more than the normal kind of PLS that you'd see, more than maintenance, much more strategic, it's going to be a bit of a drag on revenue for the full year, we would say. We probably expect specialty to be up just above flat, maybe flat to low single digits for the full year. But the important thing here is that the strong work that we are doing to really make this segment a 4% grower in the long-term. And based on the progress that we've seen this year, we certainly believe we can do that.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then Chris and Michael, you mentioned that demand continues to moderate in Q2, but could you give us a little more color regarding the cadence of the demand you saw? Has demand stabilized at lower levels across your short cycle businesses, or would you say it's still getting worse? And then with the understanding that you're forecasting the exit rate of Q2, you do have much easier comps in the second half. So just at the enterprise level, are you digging in any conservatism or is it really just on run rates?\nMichael Larsen: Well, so I think in terms of the cadence, I think we saw as we were going through the quarter is the demand continued to moderate as the quarter by -- as the quarter progressed. And by segment, definitely auto, as auto builds came down, the CapEx businesses that Chris mentioned, Test & Measurement and Welding, were maybe a little bit more impacted than some of the other businesses. I think on a positive note, I just might add that June also had really strong margin performance. So I think we got some good margin momentum heading into the second half. In terms of the back half of the year, as we said, per our typical process, this is based on current levels of demand that we're seeing in these businesses adjusted for seasonality. We do have, as you recall, some more favorable comparisons here in the second half of the year. If you look at last year, we were up 4% in the first half of '23, and we're flat in the second half of '23. So, the comparisons definitely get easier. We also have the benefit of two additional shipping days in the back half, one in Q3 and one in Q4. And then the last thing I would add is we've updated the automotive build forecast, as we saw a decline there from previously about flat for the year to down 2%. And we expect to outgrow that per typical 2% to 3% and we continue to outgrow by a little bit more than that in China as we've talked about previously. So those are all the elements that kind of went into the top line guidance. I might just add, if you look at the reduction, 1 to 3 organic now to about flat, and you look at kind of the flow-through on that, that's about a 20% decremental, just given how strong the margin performance is and how flexible our cost structure is so that we can continue to kind of read and react to whatever demand environment we're dealing with in the second half.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate all the color.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: We'll move next to Scott Davis at Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, guys.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nScott Davis: I know I probably asked this in prior quarters, but M&A is, I assume, no change in strategy there, more bolt-ons? Or we have heard of some larger assets that are going to become available, would you guys be comfortable casting a wider net there?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So, Scott, I think our posture on M&A hasn't changed much. I mean, as we shared at our Investor Day, we have a pretty disciplined portfolio management strategy and we're certainly staying consistent to that. From our standpoint, we have a pretty clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy and our financial criteria. So, for us, it's a case of just finding the right opportunities. Very much focused on high-quality acquisitions that can extend our long-term growth potential, growing at a minimum of 4% plus at high-quality. We've been able to leverage the business model to improve margins. So we review opportunities certainly on an ongoing basis, pretty selective given what we believe to be pretty compelling organic growth potential that we have in our core businesses. And if I go back to the MTS acquisition from a couple of years ago, that was certainly an acquisition that ticked all the boxes and only a couple of years in here and already turning out to be a great ITW business. So to the extent that we can find acquisitions like that, then we'll certainly be very active.\nScott Davis: Okay. Fair enough, Chris. And then I was just looking back at your investor deck and your growth, your long-term growth targets, 4 to 7, 2 to 3 points of that were coming from customer-backed innovation, and you did mention that in your prepared remarks. But are you still confident that you can drive that kind of growth from customer-backed innovation? It seems like a lot to me, but you guys would have a better feel for that.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes, I was going to say, Scott, that we're even more confident now than we were at Investor Day. Our confidence has certainly continued to grow. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing in our businesses. It's one of the reasons that we believe that we're outperforming our end markets right now. And our view on customer-backed innovation is that we're going to lean into customer-backed innovation in the same way with a similar approach that we utilized in really reinvigorating front to back 80-20 in the last phase of our enterprise strategy in terms of our intention around it, in terms of the rigor and capability build that's going on all over this company right now. And in doing so, increase our contribution from what was approximately 1% in 2019 to north of 2% today, and what will be north of 3% in the not too distant future. So everything we see on customer back and the work we're doing in our divisions gives us an even stronger sense of confidence that this is going to be really impactful in terms of our ability to grow 4% plus in the long-term.\nScott Davis: Okay, thank you, Chris. I'll pass it on, appreciate it.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Sure, Scott. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tami Zakaria at JPMorgan.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nTami Zakaria: So my first question is -- morning. So, my first question is North America saw negative, I think you said 2% organic growth while other regions are positive. Are you still seeing destocking headwinds in North America or any other region? Or is the market softening now more a function of just demand rather than destocking?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think it's more the latter, Tami, that demand is a function of where we are in the economic cycle. And so destocking, which was a headwind all of last year, is no longer a significant factor at this point. I think if you look at just North America, down 2% was really driven by Welding, down 6%. And then Auto, Polymers & Fluids down 4%. And then some positive momentum in Food Equipment up 2% and Specialty up 5%. But again, that's really more reflection of kind of where we're at in the cycle versus anything going on from a destocking standpoint.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a bit clarity on the new operating margin guide. So operating margin expected up about 165 basis points on flattish organic growth. Can you help me understand that 165 basis points, how much of that is enterprise initiatives versus the 140 you saw in the first half? And then is there any price cost or volume or anything else that's adding to that 165 basis points year-over-year?\nMichael Larsen: Yes, I think not a lot of volume leverage, obviously, as we're guiding to about flat growth for the year. The biggest driver continues to be the enterprise initiatives. As you said, we got 140 basis points in the first half. The roll-up for the second half looks really good. As we said today, more than 100 basis points. And so somewhere I would say between 100 and 140 is maybe a reasonable estimate. And then price-cost, a modest contribution. We're kind of back to a normal price-cost environment. And so that's not a significant driver. Really the big driver here, as I think you pointed out, are the enterprise initiatives that independent of volume, continue to contribute in a meaningful way, which is a great position to be in -- in a -- given where we are in the cycle, in a pretty challenging and uncertain environment. And without giving too much away, as we kind of look into the future beyond this year, we'd expect another solid contribution in 2025 and beyond.\nTami Zakaria: Understood. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: Sure.\nOperator: We'll go next to Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning, Joe.\nMichael Larsen: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Can we go back to Specialty for a second? You guys talked about the strategic positioning efforts there and when I think about that business, it's a hodgepodge of a bunch of different businesses that seemingly don't have a lot to do with each other. And so I'm just trying to understand like what's the kind of like overall strategy with the businesses within Specialty. And then what are you guys really doing to kind of drive this margin expansion sustainably higher over the long-term?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes, so Joseph, specialty is indeed, as you said, a collection of high-quality, high-margin businesses. There is a concentration around consumer packaging, both on the equipment side, on the consumable side. There's also a bit of a concentration around appliance components. And then there's a collection of smaller businesses, one of which is primarily lined up alongside aerospace, that are very attractive and certainly capable of growth. So we're going through a strategic repositioning of some of those businesses in terms of heavier leaning on PLS. We haven't seen much growth in Specialty over the last few years, as you know, so that's what caused us to really look at the portfolio. But we feel very good about the progress we're making in terms of there's a lot of high differentiated product lanes in that segment. And this repositioning will put us in a position where we accentuate the growth of those, we resource those, and we maybe de-resource some other ones that are not in a position to grow. But overall, I would say it's a nice portfolio of businesses with a strong differentiation lineage running through it. And as I say, we are well-positioned to grow to some 4% plus in the long-term.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great, Chris. And then maybe just to follow-up to that is, sometimes companies will go through this, addition by subtraction exercise, and it sounds like you guys are in the process of improving the margins. The margins are already good. But it also kind of seems like there's an opportunity then for you guys to potentially divest some of those assets going forward, whether it's in the specialty business or beyond in the rest of your portfolio, how are you guys thinking about that equation in the divestiture side?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. So, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. We believe we've got a very high-quality portfolio and if the opportunity comes to divest, we would certainly do that. I would say that as we think about portfolio management today, it's more likely to be in the realm of product-lane pruning as opposed to divestiture. Now, that could change, but as we look at it today, it's much more along the lanes of pruning within businesses as opposed to divestiture of businesses, I would say.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Julian Mitchell at Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a question around the free cash flow conversions, because I think it's sort of 67% in the first half, the year's guided a 100 plus. Doesn't seem like there should be a lot of working cap liquidation in the second half because the quarterly revenue run rate is kind of stable at $4 billion. So maybe just to flesh out the confidence in the cash conversion step up, please.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes, sure, Julian. I mean, I think you're right. We are slightly below our typical conversion range here for the first half. And I think on the last call, we talked about our focus at the divisional level on reducing our inventory months on hand from we're right around 3.1 right now as compared to pre-COVID, 2.5 or even a little bit lower than that in some of our segments. So, we've made some progress. Inventory is down a double-digit on a year-over-year basis. But I would agree with you that we can definitely do better. We fully expect to take advantage of this opportunity in the second half to reduce inventory levels and generate above average free cash flow while, as I said, maintaining our typical ITW [indiscernible] customer service level. So big focus on this in the second half. And just given our track record around, kind of do what we say, execution, we feel like we're really well-positioned to generate above average free cash flow in the second half.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question would be around the sort of, it looks like the second half run rate on the total company sales and margins, very similar to Q2, as you normally guide, with sort of 26% margin, $4 billion revenue a quarter. You mentioned, Michael, the day sales effect in Q3, Q4, but just wondered, anything else in terms of seasonality for total company you'd remind us of for the third versus the fourth quarter? Any big moving parts on the segment margin as we step into the back half? I think Specialty, you've talked about Polymer & Fluid, I'm also curious about the margin outlook there, please.\nMichael Larsen: Yes. Yes, I think all good questions, Julian. I mean, Q3 looks a lot like Q2, I would say. We typically see a modest increase in revenues from Q3 to Q4, with emphasis on modest. And we also see typically a modest improvement in operating margins as we go through the year -- from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4. And so there's really nothing unusual going on there. We do, as you pointed out, we do benefit from having a couple of extra days here in the second half and then, like I said, more favorable comparisons. The other thing that would not be in the run rates is what Chris talked about earlier, which is this increased contribution from new products coming in at higher margins. But we feel like we've really maybe taken not just an approach that's consistent with kind of how we've done it historically in terms of guidance, but a fairly conservative approach going into the second half. Certainly things can change quickly. Things kind of improve, but they can also deteriorate and hopefully, kind of parsing out for you the impact here in Q2 in terms of what a point of revenue growth sequentially means or decline means, the $50 million at the decremental that we talked about, I think gives you a way to kind of further risk adjust your numbers, or if you are more optimistic, you can certainly make those adjustments as well. But that's kind of how we think about the guidance here for the second half.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nMichael Larsen: You're welcome.\nOperator: And we'll take our final question from Walt Liptak at Seaport Research.\nWalt Liptak: Good morning. Thanks, Chris and Mike. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the guidance and just a comment that you made on the first question about -- it sounds like June might have gotten a little bit better for some of the capital goods businesses like welding or maybe some others. I wonder if you can talk about that, that some of that macro industrial weakness start to get better.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Well, yes, I think, Walt, June was -- things continued to moderate, particularly Auto Builds were softer in June. And then on the CapEx side, Welding, I think consistent with commentary you may have heard from some of our peers in the welding space. And then Test & Measurement, I think while we have not seen a pickup in semiconductor or electronics or CapEx, I would say semi also has not gotten worse. So it's kind of bumping along. And I would just add that we remain like really well-positioned for the inevitable recovery down the road. And I think if you look at, some of the segments with positive organic growth here in Q2, so you look at Specialty, you look at Polymers & Fluids, the operating leverage that we generate of fairly modest organic growth is pretty remarkable. So we're really well-positioned for that. We continue to invest, a lot of focus on new products, but we've not seen a pickup in those markets yet. But again, really well-positioned for the inevitable recovery down the road here, whenever that may happen.\nWalt Liptak: Okay. Yes, totally agree with that. On one of the segments it's doing -- that's growing, Food Equipment, you guys sounded kind of upbeat about kind of the retail chain, despite some of the bankruptcies that have been going on. I wonder if you can talk about, maybe in a little bit more detail, how that retail part of the business is moving?\nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes, I mean, I think the retail growth similar to in the first quarter, I think up 9% here in the second quarter, and it's all driven by new products. So this is all way and wrap equipment and new product rollouts. And I'd say our customer base is not part of the population that you may be alluding to that's having trouble financially. I mean, these are all the big grocery store, retailers, chains that you would expect. And so we're not seeing any impact there from them being in trouble financially. Quite on -- quite the contrary.\nWalt Liptak: Okay, great. Okay, congratulations for that. Thanks.\nChristopher O'Herlihy: All right, thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. Thank you for participating in today's conference call. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q2, revenue declined 1% with organic revenue down 0.1%, essentially flat year-over-year, and a slight improvement from being down 0.6% in Q1. As Chris said, demand moderated sequentially as total company revenues grew 2% from the first quarter to the second quarter, a point below our historical run rate growth of 3%. Faced with moderating demand, the ITW team, as usual, did a great job in terms of reading and reacting to the environment and delivered record margin and profitability performance in the second quarter, as evidenced by 4.5% operating income growth and operating margins of 26.2%, an improvement of 140 basis points as enterprise initiatives were once again the largest margin and profitability driver contributing 140 basis points this quarter with more to come in the second half. GAAP EPS of $2.54 increased 2% or 5% excluding a 2023 one-time tax item. Our free cash flow was $571 million which was a 75% conversion of net income, slightly below our historical conversion in the 80% range, as we continue to focus on reducing our inventory months on hand to pre-pandemic levels without impacting customer service levels. We repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter as planned, and the effective tax rate was 24.4% compared to 21.4% in the prior year, which lowered EPS by $0.10. In addition, foreign currency translation was approximately a $0.05 headwind year-over-year. In summary, strong execution and Q2 results as the impact of a moderating short cycle demand environment was offset by strong margin and profitability performance. Please turn to Slide 4 for a look at organic growth by geography. The 2% decline in North America was an improvement over the first quarter's 3% decline. Europe grew 1% and Asia Pacific grew 3%, with China up 5%. Moving on to segment results, the Automotive OEM segment delivered flat organic growth in the second quarter against a tough comparison of plus 16% in the year-ago quarter. North America was down 4%, Europe was down 2%, and China was up 7%. In the first half, Automotive Builds were flat, and our Automotive OEM segment grew 2% above market. For the full year, we continue to expect solid above-market growth with our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued outgrowth in China. In our guidance, we have now factored in the most recent automotive build projections, which have declined to negative 2% for the full year. As you may recall, when we issued our initial guidance in February, Automotive Builds were expected to be flat for the year. On a positive note, the segment delivered strong operating margin performance of 19.4%, a 260 basis points improvement, as we continue to work towards our goal of achieving operating margins in the low to mid-20s by 2026. Turn to Slide 5, Food Equipment organic revenue grew 2.5% against a comparison of plus 7% in the second quarter of last year. Equipment grew 1% and service grew 5% against a comparison of plus 16% last year. By region, North America increased 2% with service up 3%. Organic growth in the institutional market was up mid single digits, and the retail market was up high single digits. International revenue was up 3.5% led by Europe. As we talked about last quarter, the current margin performance reflects the fact that we're making focused capacity investments in the first half of 2024 to support and accelerate continued above-market organic growth in our very attractive service business. Looking forward, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially as we go through the year. Turning to Test & Measurement and Electronics, organic revenue was down 3% with continued softness in semiconductor, electronics, and CapEx-sensitive end markets. Both Test & Measurement and Electronics were down 3% in the quarter. Moving on to Slide 6, Welding was down 5% in Q2, as Equipment declined 5% and consumables were down 3%. By region, North America declined 6% with industrial sales down 7% and the commercial side down 6%. International grew 3% with some strength in Europe. Operating margin was 32.9% with a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue in Polymers & Fluids increased 3%, led by Polymers up 10%, and Fluids was up 4%. Automotive aftermarket was down 2% in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 4% and international grew 13%. Operating margin of 28.2% improved more than 200 basis points. Turn to Slide 7. Demand trends in construction products continue to be challenging on a global basis as organic revenue declined 4% in Q2 in a market that we believe is down in the mid to high single digits. North America was down 2% as the residential and renovation business was down 2% and commercial was down 9%. International markets remain soft as Europe was down 7% and Australia and New Zealand was down 4%. Finally, specialty products had a strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7% due to significant strength in our aerospace equipment division as well as pockets of increased demand across our portfolio. As a result, international was up 10% and North America was up 5%. As previously discussed, results can be a bit choppy as we continue to work to reposition the Specialty segment for consistent above-market organic growth, including strategic portfolio work and more significant product line simplification, which included 230 basis points in Q2. Operating margin improved 590 basis points to 31.9% with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and operating leverage. With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2024 guidance. Despite a challenging first half macro demand environment, the ITW team found a way to deliver solid operational and financial results. And excluding one-time items, we grew operating income 4% in the first half as margins improved by 130 basis points to 25.8% with 140 basis points from enterprise initiatives. GAAP EPS was up 10% -- up 5% excluding one-time items. Looking ahead to the second half in our updated guidance, we do not expect the short cycle demand environment to improve. Per usual process, we are adjusting our full year guidance in line with conditions on the ground as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 adjusted for typical seasonality and the most recent automotive build forecast projected through the remainder of the year would result in approximately flat organic growth for the year in markets that we believe are down in the low single digits. This compares to a prior organic growth guidance of 1% to 3% and impacts EPS by approximately $0.25. The lower top line guidance is partially offset by stronger margin and profitability performance, which is expected to continue into the second half, including a significant contribution of more than 100 basis points from enterprise initiatives. As a result, we raised margin guidance to 26.5% to 27% as we continue to make solid progress towards our goal of 30% operating margin by 2030. The higher margins impact EPS favorably by about $0.10. The net of these two factors, as you saw this morning, is that we lowered the top end of the range of our full-year GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $10.30 to $10.40, which is a reduction of $0.15 or 1% at the midpoint from $10.50 to $10.35 with 6 months to go in the year. To wrap things up, we delivered a solid Q2 and first half in a challenging demand environment, and we've updated our full year guidance per usual process to reflect current levels of demand. Given the strength of our competitive advantages, the resilience of the ITW business model, and our diversified high-quality portfolio, we're well-positioned for whatever economic conditions emerged through the second half of the year. With that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. Good morning, Andy. Yes. So, Andy, we've had a -- as you've outlined, a very solid half one here in specialty. There's a few different things going on. I think strength in aerospace has been a feature throughout the first half. There's some other pockets of strong demand elsewhere. Obviously, we had favorable comps in specialty and we've also benefited from the timing of some orders, particularly in Q1 for some of our European equipment businesses. This is a segment that we've got some strategic portfolio repositioning going on. A bit more than the normal kind of PLS that you'd see, more than maintenance, much more strategic, it's going to be a bit of a drag on revenue for the full year, we would say. We probably expect specialty to be up just above flat, maybe flat to low single digits for the full year. But the important thing here is that the strong work that we are doing to really make this segment a 4% grower in the long-term. And based on the progress that we've seen this year, we certainly believe we can do that. Well, so I think in terms of the cadence, I think we saw as we were going through the quarter is the demand continued to moderate as the quarter by -- as the quarter progressed. And by segment, definitely auto, as auto builds came down, the CapEx businesses that Chris mentioned, Test & Measurement and Welding, were maybe a little bit more impacted than some of the other businesses. I think on a positive note, I just might add that June also had really strong margin performance. So I think we got some good margin momentum heading into the second half. In terms of the back half of the year, as we said, per our typical process, this is based on current levels of demand that we're seeing in these businesses adjusted for seasonality. We do have, as you recall, some more favorable comparisons here in the second half of the year. If you look at last year, we were up 4% in the first half of '23, and we're flat in the second half of '23. So, the comparisons definitely get easier. We also have the benefit of two additional shipping days in the back half, one in Q3 and one in Q4. And then the last thing I would add is we've updated the automotive build forecast, as we saw a decline there from previously about flat for the year to down 2%. And we expect to outgrow that per typical 2% to 3% and we continue to outgrow by a little bit more than that in China as we've talked about previously. So those are all the elements that kind of went into the top line guidance. I might just add, if you look at the reduction, 1 to 3 organic now to about flat, and you look at kind of the flow-through on that, that's about a 20% decremental, just given how strong the margin performance is and how flexible our cost structure is so that we can continue to kind of read and react to whatever demand environment we're dealing with in the second half. Sure. Good morning. Good morning. Yes, I think it's more the latter, Tami, that demand is a function of where we are in the economic cycle. And so destocking, which was a headwind all of last year, is no longer a significant factor at this point. I think if you look at just North America, down 2% was really driven by Welding, down 6%. And then Auto, Polymers & Fluids down 4%. And then some positive momentum in Food Equipment up 2% and Specialty up 5%. But again, that's really more reflection of kind of where we're at in the cycle versus anything going on from a destocking standpoint. Yes, I think not a lot of volume leverage, obviously, as we're guiding to about flat growth for the year. The biggest driver continues to be the enterprise initiatives. As you said, we got 140 basis points in the first half. The roll-up for the second half looks really good. As we said today, more than 100 basis points. And so somewhere I would say between 100 and 140 is maybe a reasonable estimate. And then price-cost, a modest contribution. We're kind of back to a normal price-cost environment. And so that's not a significant driver. Really the big driver here, as I think you pointed out, are the enterprise initiatives that independent of volume, continue to contribute in a meaningful way, which is a great position to be in -- in a -- given where we are in the cycle, in a pretty challenging and uncertain environment. And without giving too much away, as we kind of look into the future beyond this year, we'd expect another solid contribution in 2025 and beyond. Sure. Good morning. Yes. Yes, I think all good questions, Julian. I mean, Q3 looks a lot like Q2, I would say. We typically see a modest increase in revenues from Q3 to Q4, with emphasis on modest. And we also see typically a modest improvement in operating margins as we go through the year -- from Q2 to Q3 and then into Q4. And so there's really nothing unusual going on there. We do, as you pointed out, we do benefit from having a couple of extra days here in the second half and then, like I said, more favorable comparisons. The other thing that would not be in the run rates is what Chris talked about earlier, which is this increased contribution from new products coming in at higher margins. But we feel like we've really maybe taken not just an approach that's consistent with kind of how we've done it historically in terms of guidance, but a fairly conservative approach going into the second half. Certainly things can change quickly. Things kind of improve, but they can also deteriorate and hopefully, kind of parsing out for you the impact here in Q2 in terms of what a point of revenue growth sequentially means or decline means, the $50 million at the decremental that we talked about, I think gives you a way to kind of further risk adjust your numbers, or if you are more optimistic, you can certainly make those adjustments as well. But that's kind of how we think about the guidance here for the second half. You're welcome."

            "content": "Thank you, Erin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release this morning, during the second quarter, the short cycle demand environment continued to moderate across our portfolio. At the total company level, second quarter revenues came in approximately 1 percentage point, or $50 million below what they would have been had demand held at the level we were seeing exiting the first quarter. Second quarter organic revenue was down in three segments with declines year-over-year in CapEx-related products such as welding, test and measurement and construction. These declines were offset by revenue growth in four segments resulting in overall flat organic growth year-over-year at the total company level as compared to our end markets which we believe were down in the low single digits. As usual, as the quarter progressed, the ITW team executed well on all the elements within our control. As evidenced by record second quarter operating margin, which improved by 140 basis points, 26.2%, supported by 140 basis points of benefit from enterprise initiatives. Operating income grew 4.5% to a second quarter record of $1.05 billion and GAAP EPS came in at $2.54, up from $2.48 last year. As per our normal practice, we are adjusting our full year guidance in line with demand levels in our businesses as they exist today. Current run rates exiting Q2 projected through the remainder of the year results in about flat organic revenue for the full year. The moderating demand is partially offset by stronger margin performance and we are raising our margin guidance to 26.5% to 27%. Factoring in both of these elements, lower market demand and stronger margin performance, we are lowering the midpoint of our EPS guidance by 1% as we narrow the range to $10.30 to $10.40. While the combination of moderating manufacturing CapEx demand and lower automotive bill forecasts for the second half has us operating in a challenging near-term environment, we will continue to drive our usual high-quality execution on all the elements within our control, while remaining focused on managing and investing to maximize the company's growth and performance over the long-term, as we build above market organic growth fueled by customer-backed innovation into a core ITW strength. In this regard, we are very encouraged by the progress we are making on customer-backed innovation in each of our divisions. In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and for their dedication to serving our customers with excellence and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our second quarter performance in more detail, as well as our updated full year guidance. Michael? Good morning. Good morning. Yes. So, Scott, I think our posture on M&A hasn't changed much. I mean, as we shared at our Investor Day, we have a pretty disciplined portfolio management strategy and we're certainly staying consistent to that. From our standpoint, we have a pretty clear and well-defined view of what fits our strategy and our financial criteria. So, for us, it's a case of just finding the right opportunities. Very much focused on high-quality acquisitions that can extend our long-term growth potential, growing at a minimum of 4% plus at high-quality. We've been able to leverage the business model to improve margins. So we review opportunities certainly on an ongoing basis, pretty selective given what we believe to be pretty compelling organic growth potential that we have in our core businesses. And if I go back to the MTS acquisition from a couple of years ago, that was certainly an acquisition that ticked all the boxes and only a couple of years in here and already turning out to be a great ITW business. So to the extent that we can find acquisitions like that, then we'll certainly be very active. Yes, I was going to say, Scott, that we're even more confident now than we were at Investor Day. Our confidence has certainly continued to grow. We're very encouraged by what we're seeing in our businesses. It's one of the reasons that we believe that we're outperforming our end markets right now. And our view on customer-backed innovation is that we're going to lean into customer-backed innovation in the same way with a similar approach that we utilized in really reinvigorating front to back 80-20 in the last phase of our enterprise strategy in terms of our intention around it, in terms of the rigor and capability build that's going on all over this company right now. And in doing so, increase our contribution from what was approximately 1% in 2019 to north of 2% today, and what will be north of 3% in the not too distant future. So everything we see on customer back and the work we're doing in our divisions gives us an even stronger sense of confidence that this is going to be really impactful in terms of our ability to grow 4% plus in the long-term. Sure, Scott. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Joe. Yes, so Joseph, specialty is indeed, as you said, a collection of high-quality, high-margin businesses. There is a concentration around consumer packaging, both on the equipment side, on the consumable side. There's also a bit of a concentration around appliance components. And then there's a collection of smaller businesses, one of which is primarily lined up alongside aerospace, that are very attractive and certainly capable of growth. So we're going through a strategic repositioning of some of those businesses in terms of heavier leaning on PLS. We haven't seen much growth in Specialty over the last few years, as you know, so that's what caused us to really look at the portfolio. But we feel very good about the progress we're making in terms of there's a lot of high differentiated product lanes in that segment. And this repositioning will put us in a position where we accentuate the growth of those, we resource those, and we maybe de-resource some other ones that are not in a position to grow. But overall, I would say it's a nice portfolio of businesses with a strong differentiation lineage running through it. And as I say, we are well-positioned to grow to some 4% plus in the long-term. Yes. So, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. We believe we've got a very high-quality portfolio and if the opportunity comes to divest, we would certainly do that. I would say that as we think about portfolio management today, it's more likely to be in the realm of product-lane pruning as opposed to divestiture. Now, that could change, but as we look at it today, it's much more along the lanes of pruning within businesses as opposed to divestiture of businesses, I would say. Good morning. Yes, sure, Julian. I mean, I think you're right. We are slightly below our typical conversion range here for the first half. And I think on the last call, we talked about our focus at the divisional level on reducing our inventory months on hand from we're right around 3.1 right now as compared to pre-COVID, 2.5 or even a little bit lower than that in some of our segments. So, we've made some progress. Inventory is down a double-digit on a year-over-year basis. But I would agree with you that we can definitely do better. We fully expect to take advantage of this opportunity in the second half to reduce inventory levels and generate above average free cash flow while, as I said, maintaining our typical ITW [indiscernible] customer service level. So big focus on this in the second half. And just given our track record around, kind of do what we say, execution, we feel like we're really well-positioned to generate above average free cash flow in the second half. Well, yes, I think, Walt, June was -- things continued to moderate, particularly Auto Builds were softer in June. And then on the CapEx side, Welding, I think consistent with commentary you may have heard from some of our peers in the welding space. And then Test & Measurement, I think while we have not seen a pickup in semiconductor or electronics or CapEx, I would say semi also has not gotten worse. So it's kind of bumping along. And I would just add that we remain like really well-positioned for the inevitable recovery down the road. And I think if you look at, some of the segments with positive organic growth here in Q2, so you look at Specialty, you look at Polymers & Fluids, the operating leverage that we generate of fairly modest organic growth is pretty remarkable. So we're really well-positioned for that. We continue to invest, a lot of focus on new products, but we've not seen a pickup in those markets yet. But again, really well-positioned for the inevitable recovery down the road here, whenever that may happen. Yes, I mean, I think the retail growth similar to in the first quarter, I think up 9% here in the second quarter, and it's all driven by new products. So this is all way and wrap equipment and new product rollouts. And I'd say our customer base is not part of the population that you may be alluding to that's having trouble financially. I mean, these are all the big grocery store, retailers, chains that you would expect. And so we're not seeing any impact there from them being in trouble financially. Quite on -- quite the contrary. All right, thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ITW's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n Erin Linnihan, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. \nErin Linnihan: Thank you, Krista. Good morning, and welcome to ITW's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Chris O\u2019Herlihy; Senior Vice President and CFO, Michael Larsen; and Vice President of Investor Relations, Karen Fletcher. During today's call, we will discuss ITW's first quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for full year 2024. \n Slide 2 is a reminder that this presentation contains forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's 2023 Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the SEC for more detail about important risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. This presentation uses certain non-GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is contained in the press release. \n Please turn to Slide 3, and it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our President and CEO, Chris O\u2019Herlihy. \nChristopher O'Herlihy: Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. While the near-term demand environment across the majority of our segments was certainly challenging as we anticipated, the ITW team delivered a solid start to the year as our first quarter results came in as expected. And we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 performance targets.\n Starting with the top line. Organic growth was down 0.6% as 5 of 7 segments declined in the face of a tough demand environment and versus some difficult comparisons year-over-year. Those comparisons are more favorable for the balance of the year, and based on current levels of demand, we are confident that we will deliver on our full year performance targets, including organic growth of 1% to 3%.\n The ITW team continued to execute at a very high level and delivered strong margin and profitability performance in the first quarter. Excluding a onetime inventory accounting item, quarterly operating income grew 4%, as operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 25.4%, with a strong contribution from enterprise initiatives of 140 basis points, as we continue to make solid progress towards our goal of 30% operating margin by 2030. GAAP EPS of $2.73 increased 17%, and excluding the onetime item, we grew EPS 5% to $2.44. The free cash flow conversion rate of 68% was in line with normal Q1 levels.\n Looking ahead, where we did raise our GAAP EPS and margin guidance for the year to account for the onetime item, our operational guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect that current levels of demand across the majority of our end markets and favorable year-over-year comparisons will translate to positive organic growth through the balance of the year. Combined with our continued strong margin and profitability performance, we are confident that ITW is firmly on track and well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 guidance. \n In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and for their dedication to serving our customers with excellence, and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. \n I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail, as well as our updated full year guidance. Michael? \nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, we delivered a solid start to the year with some high-quality execution in a pretty challenging demand environment as expected. \n Despite an organic revenue decline of 0.6%, operating income grew 4% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.4% as enterprise initiative contributed 140 basis points. \n EPS increased 5% to $2.44, excluding a onetime item. Our free cash flow was $494 million, and we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter as planned. EPS increased 17% to $2.73, and operating margin expanded 420 basis points to 28.4%.\n As you saw this morning, our GAAP results include a onetime LIFO inventory accounting change that resulted in a favorable pretax impact of $117 million to cost of revenue equal to $0.29 a share. In Q1, we made the decision to transition from the LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting method for all of our U.S. businesses, because it is a more consistent and simpler method for valuing inventory across our operations. \n In summary, Q1 results were as expected in the current environment, and growth rates are projected to improve as we go through the balance of the year. Our margin and profitability performance continues to be strong, and we're solidly on track to deliver on our guidance, which I will discuss in a few slides. \n Please turn to Slide 4 for a look at organic growth by geography. As you can see, the 4% decline in North America was partially offset by positive growth internationally, as Europe grew 1% and Asia Pacific grew 6%, led by China up 15%. Excluding the 23% growth rate in our Chinese automotive OEM business, organic growth in China was still up 7%. \n For the full year and for our usual process, which is based on current levels of demand, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in both North America and Europe, with Asia Pacific up in the mid-single digits, led by China.\n Moving on to segment results and starting with the Automotive OEM segment, which delivered solid organic growth of 3% despite North America being down 6% as Europe grew 2% and China grew 23%, driven by continued strong penetration and market share gains. For the full year, we continue to expect solid above-market growth with our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued outgrowth in China. \n Margin and profitability performance was strong as margins improved by 370 basis points to 19.8%, and enterprise initiatives contributed more than 200 basis points. We continue to make solid progress on the margin enhancement plan in this segment, and we are firmly on track to deliver margins in the low to mid-20s by 2026, which you will recall is what we said we would do at our Investor Day last year.\n Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment organic revenue declined 1% as expected against a tough comparison of plus 16% in the first quarter last year. Equipment was down 4%, and service grew 3%. And by region, North America declined 2% due to a particularly difficult comparison of plus 21%. On a positive note, the retail business was up 10%, fueled by new product launches and overall North America order activity in Q1 was pretty encouraging across the board. International revenue was flat with Europe down 1% and Asia Pacific up 6%. \n While 5 of our 7 segments improved their margins in Q1, Food Equipment margins declined modestly to 26% as a result of focused capacity investments to support and accelerate continued above-market organic growth in our very attractive service business. Looking forward, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially as we go through the year. \n Turning to Test & Measurement and Electronics. Organic revenue was down modestly as Test & Measurement grew 2% despite a tough comparison of plus 12%. Electronics was down 8% due to challenging near-term demand trends in electronic assembly. The recent MTS acquisition continues to perform well and grew more than 20%. With margins that are improving, but still in the mid-teens, this created a mix headwind for this segment and diluted segment margins by about 250 basis points. \n Looking ahead, we expect Test & Measurement and Electronics margins to improve from here as we go through the balance of the year. \n Moving on to Slide 6. And as expected, Welding faced a tough demand environment and year-over-year comparison of plus 10%, which resulted in a decline of 3% in Q1. Equipment declined 2% and consumables were down 6%. Industrial sales declined 1% versus an 18% comparison, and the commercial side was down 6%. By region, North America declined 3% against the comparison of plus 10% and international declined 8%. \n On a positive note, operating margin improved 80 basis points to 32.7% with a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue in Polymers & Fluids declined modestly as Automotive Aftermarket was down 2%, and both Fluids and Polymers were essentially flat in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 5% and international grew 5%, led by China. Operating margins improved 104 basis points to 25.8%.\n Turning to Slide 7. Near-term demand trends in Construction Products continued to be challenging on a global basis as organic revenue declined 7% in Q1. North America was down 3% as the residential and renovation business was down 1%. And international markets remained soft as Europe was down 11% and Australia and New Zealand was down 12%. On a positive note, operating margin improved 190 basis points to 29.4%, driven primarily by another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. \n Finally, Specialty Products. Organic revenue growth was up 6%, due primarily to the timing of large equipment orders in 2 European businesses. As a result, international was up 19% and North America was down 1%. \n As we have talked about before, we're working to reposition the Specialty segment for consistent above-market organic growth, which involves some strategic portfolio work and more significant product line simplification as we go forward.\n Operating margin improved 410 basis points to 29.7%, driven by operating leverage and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives.\n With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2024 guidance. With Q1 results that were right in line with our expectations, we're solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 performance targets and guidance. Looking ahead and starting with the top line, we do see some positives in terms of stable demand, more favorable comparisons year-over-year as we move forward, a normalized pricing and inflationary environment, new product launches, and no meaningful headwind from inventory destocking. \n Per our usual process, our organic growth guidance of 1% to 3% is based on current run rates adjusted for typical seasonality. Operating margin is expected to improve by 140 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 26% to 27%, which includes more than 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives and 50 basis points from the onetime item in Q1. \n As I mentioned on our last call, every segment is projecting to improve their operating margin performance, again, in 2024, with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives across the board. After-tax return on capital is expected to remain firmly above 30%, and we expect strong free cash flows, again, with conversion greater than net income. \n As you saw this morning, we raised our full year GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $10.30 to $10.70, which now includes $0.30 of EPS from the Q1 inventory accounting change. Setting that item aside, our operational guidance remains essentially unchanged as we expect a combined headwind of about $0.30 from higher interest expense, currency and income taxes, with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. \n In terms of cadence for the year, we expect our first half, second half EPS split to be about 50-50 this year, as we factor in the onetime item in the first quarter, which compares to our typical split of 49-51, so slightly less back-end loaded than usual. \n To wrap things up, as expected, the ITW team continues to execute at a very high level in a challenging near-term demand environment, which we anticipate will improve as we go through the balance of the year based on current levels of demand and more favorable comparison. In addition, our first quarter results came in as expected, and we are solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 guidance. \n On a separate note, today is Karen Fletcher's last ITW earnings call. Over the last 6 years, Karen has been instrumental in articulating ITW's unique and differentiated competitive advantages and our plan to leverage them to their full potential to you, the investment community, in a clear and compelling manner. \n In doing so, she has helped us position ITW as one of the world's highest quality, best performing, and most respected industrial companies. Please join Chris and me in thanking Karen, for her many contributions to ITW and wishing her all the best in retirement. \nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Michael. That means a lot, and it's been a privilege to do that. \nMichael Larsen: Thank you, Karen. And with that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. \nErin Linnihan: Thank you, Michael. Krista, will you please open the line for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Cook from Truist Securities. \nJamie Cook: Congrats Karen, and thanks for all your help over the past 6 years. \nKaren Fletcher: Thank you, Jamie. \nJamie Cook: My first question on the Food Equipment side, I think, Michael, you noted some positive order activity in North America. If you could just speak to what you're seeing there? And then how much of a margin headwind was the capacity investments that you spoke about?\n And then my follow-up question, just on Specialty. I know you spoke to taking portfolio actions in PLS. If you could just give a little more color there, where are you taking actions? And how much is PLS, I guess, a headwind to organic growth within Specialty for the year? \nMichael Larsen: I think that was 4 questions in one, Jamie. Well, I'm going to try... \nJamie Cook: I know, but that's every quarter, so I get... \nMichael Larsen: I'm going to try my best here. So the comment on Food Equipment. I think for many of our segments, if you take a step back, these growth rates are a little unusual for us, which is really driven, as we said, by these really significant challenging comparisons that we're dealing with, including in Food Equipment.\n So the additional color, even though we're not necessarily a backlog-driven company, was directed around the order activity in North America, which grew double digit in the first quarter here, and which I think gives some additional credibility. What we're saying is that we are expecting a return to more typical growth rates here, including in Food Equipment as we go forward.\n The margin pressure, the margin impact is about 100 basis points in Food Equipment here in Q1 and Q2. And it's really as a result of taking advantage of a huge growth opportunity that's sitting right in front of us in our service business. So what we're talking about is adding a significant number of service technicians to help us meet the demand in one of the most attractive parts of our Food Equipment business. And as you know, we're the only captive OEM with the service business, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in this segment. So I think those were the 2 questions around food equipment. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Chris? \nChristopher O'Herlihy: No. I would just, I guess, accentuate the point of differentiation aspect of the service business within food with unique captive manufacturer. And this is a necessary investment at this point to capitalize on what is an undoubtedly stellar growth opportunity on the service side for us. \nMichael Larsen: And then on Specialty, the organic growth rate here was really driven by large equipment orders and the timing around those in 2 of our businesses in Europe. What we're trying to articulate on a go-forward basis is that we still expect meaningful PLS, product line simplification, as we move forward and strategically reposition this business for 4% plus growth on a consistent basis. And so we still expect a meaningful impact from that as we move forward.\n And I think kind of what we're saying is don't count on 6% organic growth as we move forward. We had guided to this segment at our last call to be down 1% to 3%. And so please keep that in mind. And the same is true for the margins. I mean, I think what you're seeing here on the margins is what happens when we get some growth in these businesses and the operating leverage here contributing in a meaningful way to 29.7% operating margins in the Specialty segment. I think that is not -- on a go-forward basis, that's Q1, both growth rate and margins are a little bit of an anomaly, and I think we expect to return to more -- still very profitable margins kind of in the high 20s, but maybe not something that starts with a 29. \nJamie Cook: Congrats again, Karen. \nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Jamie. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan. \nTami Zakaria: First off to Karen, I'll definitely miss you, but I wish you all the best of luck. And welcome aboard, Erin. Looking forward to working with you. \nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Tami. \nTami Zakaria: Of course. So my first question is, just wanted to get a little color here. I think you expect organic growth to be positive throughout the balance of the year. Does that mean you expect 2Q organic growth to be within that full year range of 1% to 3% growth? \nMichael Larsen: So Tami, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. What I will tell you to try and help you out here a little bit is that if you model kind of current levels of demand or run rate, as we call them, into Q2, what we're typically seeing is a step-up in revenues in the low single digits from Q1 to Q2. And in Automotive OEM, actually a meaningful improvement in the builds from Q1 to Q2, an increase in the low to mid-single digits there as well. So you will see slightly higher revenues in Q2.\n And given that the comparison gets easier on a year-over-year basis, we were up 5% in Q1 last year, up 3% in Q2, it is certainly possible that we'll see slightly positive organic growth here in Q2. But the more meaningful step-up really starts in the second half of the year, which is kind of what's implied in our guidance here.\n So think about it maybe as kind of flattish in the first half, maybe slightly positive in Q2, and then an improvement in the second half of the year, as the comparisons year-over-year improve by 4 points relative to the first half of the year. So in the second half last year, revenues were essentially flat, and at current run rates, you'd expect to see positive organic growth rates in the low single digits in the second half.\n And I might just add for those keeping track that there are 2 extra shipping days in the second half this year compared to the second half last year, which at least mathematically should provide some additional revenue growth for us. \nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. My second question is similar to the first one, but on the margin side. I think that in the first quarter, you had $117 million tailwind. That's about 70 basis points tailwind for the full year, but you raised the full year guide by about only $50 million. And the first quarter margin also came in a little better than what most people on the Street were modeling.\n Just trying to understand, as we think about the next 3 quarters, is there any incremental cost pressures or maybe price cost headwind than originally thought? Or is it just your conservatism that you raised the full year guide by only 50 basis points? \nMichael Larsen: Well, what I would say, Tami, is that we're really pleased with our first quarter operational performance here, as you saw in the margin rates. And if you exclude the onetime item, 140 basis points from initiatives, 120 basis points of overall margin expansion, and margins at 25.4% is a pretty significant accomplishment here for the first quarter. And we do expect, as we typically do going through the year, that margins improved sequentially from here on out. So you should see a modest improvement sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and then again into Q3 and Q4.\n The only thing I would highlight as you think about the second quarter is, similar to last year, we do expect some higher restructuring expense in the second quarter, and these are all projects that are tied to a typical 80/20 front-to-back projects. These are not tied to any concerns around volume growth whatsoever. I don't want you to think that this is pure planned restructuring for the second quarter.\n And as I said, just real quick on Q1, again, 5 of 7 segments improved margins in the current environment, including with revenues down in 5 of 7 segments. And we expect, consistent with our bottom-up planning process here for the full year, that every segment will improve margins as we go through the year and on a year-over-year basis. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. \nStephen Volkmann: Great. Karen, I can add my congratulations, and we will miss you. And Erin, welcome. And I'm impressed that you already have Karen's cadence down so well. So... \nKaren Fletcher: Thank you. \nStephen Volkmann: Can I ask a little bit about China? That seemed to be a bit of an outlier there. I guess, quite a bit of that automotive, but even without that, things seem to be relatively good. Any color you can give us on that? \nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think as you pointed out, Steve, the big driver is obviously our Automotive OEM business, up 23%. And the team there is doing a great job growing content on new vehicles, including on the EV side, and gaining market share. Even excluding those, as I said, China was still up 7% year-over-year.\n Strong contribution from Polymers & Fluids. Some of that is tied also to market share gains on the EV side of things and the bonding of some of these batteries in the assembly process, where we have a really unique and differentiated product. Specialty products also contributed. Test & Measurement grew and Food Equipment. So across the board, really solid performance in China. \n And moving forward, we'd say that looks pretty sustainable as we go into Q2, and then the second half, the comps get a little bit more difficult. But as I said, for the full year, China should be up in the mid- to high-single digits here, which is certainly encouraging. And again, I think it speaks to kind of the benefit of being as diversified from a geography standpoint as we are. And so certainly, some challenges in the first quarter in North America, but offset in Europe and in China, which is really a big benefit for us. \nStephen Volkmann: Super. And then a follow-up is on Automotive margins. Obviously, going well there, and I think you said 200 basis points or better than 200 basis points of enterprise there. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think of the cadence in auto margins as the year progresses. And I don't know, maybe the exit rate or the total year enterprise something? \nMichael Larsen: Yes. I mean, I think, I wouldn't expect a lot of regression from where we are. These are absolutely sustainable here in the 19%-plus range. And I think that's probably where we'll end up for the year, maybe a little bit better in the back half. Some of that depends on the build assumptions. There might be a little bit of restructuring here in the second quarter. But big picture, I'd say, Automotive, really solid progress here on a year-over-year basis. We expect full year margins in the 19%, almost 20% range, an improvement of 240 basis points on a year-over-year basis, and lots of room to go as we work through our margin enhancement plan. \nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. And Steve, I suppose just to support that, I mean, this is very much an improvement plan that's on track to get back to the low to mid-20s margins by 2026, as we outlined at our Investor Day, largely through a combination of, over that time, volume recovery, enterprise initiatives, and higher-margin innovation. So both in '23 and again in '24, we're very much tracking on that cadence with respect to what we outlined at our Investor Day last year. \nMichael Larsen: Yes. So nothing unusual in terms of the margins in Q1, and sustainable, but lots of room for improvement from here. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Karen, congratulations. We'll miss you. \nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Andy. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: So Michael, probably, I'm guessing you don't want to reset your organic growth guides for your segments every quarter, but just higher level, you had Construction, Specialty forecast to be down, I think 1 of 3, while the other segments were projected to be up between 2 and 4 and 3 and 5. Specialty was actually much better. Has that changed the segment's outlook at all? I know you talked about a little bit of a pull forward in some equipment orders. And were any of the other segments like weaker than you thought, to start? \nMichael Larsen: I think, Andy, you're right. We don't want to update our guidance for the segments every quarter. And what I will tell you is, given our portfolio, there's always going to be some puts and takes. And I think that's, again, I just talked about the competitive advantage with being as diversified as we are geographically. And the same is true when you look at this portfolio of businesses. You're always going to have some things that maybe are a little more pressured from a market standpoint in the short term. And those are typically offset by segments that are performing a little bit better. And it all kind of evens out to that 1% to 3% organic growth guidance.\n So I'm not really going to go through segment by segment here, but I'd say there's definitely some puts and takes, but overall, not too far off from what we talked about on the last call. And certainly, our full year guidance, we're firmly on track to deliver on that. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Michael, that's helpful. And then just in Welding, maybe give us a little more color to what you see going on there. There was some destocking end of last year, maybe a little bit still early this year. Are you getting past that, and differences between industrial and commercial markets, sort of what do you see going forward there? \nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think the big driver here is really the comparisons year-over-year. That's driving the growth rates as we go forward. And so just like I said, for the total company, for Welding, it's also true that as we go through the year, these comparisons get easier. 10% growth in Welding in the first quarter last year is obviously not a sustainable growth rate. And so it wasn't really a big surprise that organic revenue was down 3%.\n I'd say on a positive note, and this is true not just in Welding, but across the board, last year, we dealt with some meaningful headwind from excess inventory at our customers and in the channel. And to the point of magnitude, a percentage point of drag on the organic growth rate last year, that is essentially behind us at this point. So that's kind of the positive news across the board, including in Welding. \n And then we're back to a normal pricing environment. We've got an exciting lineup in terms of new products that are being launched here in the near term. And so you put all of that together, and we feel really good about the outlook here in Welding. Top line, obviously, but maybe I will just highlight the margin performance again. The fact that with revenues down, margins at 32% plus, operating margins is really strong and speaks to the focus that we have on really quality of growth over quantity of growth. And the team is executing well on that plan. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Agreed on the margin performance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. \nSabrina Abrams: You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. Congratulations, Karen. \nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Sabrina. \nSabrina Abrams: On the margin side, are there any changes to how you're thinking about volume leverage, price cost, maybe like the reinvestment in enterprise initiatives, as we move through the year? Maybe we could like walk through the different buckets and how they relate to the full year guide? \nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think there's not a lot of change from what we talked about on the last call. We are maintaining our operational guidance here kind of big picture at 1% to 3% organic growth. There is some positive operating leverage. We expect slightly more than 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives, which is based on the strong performance here in Q1 at 140 basis points.\n Price/cost has essentially normalized at this point. So there is some modest favorability from price/cost as we go through the year. Maybe a little bit more in Q1 versus the back end of the year. And then we have done a good job, as we talked about on the last call, managing some of the cost pressures from an inflationary standpoint around employee-related cost benefits. That used to be a headwind. Order of magnitude, we used to talk about 150, 200 basis points, and that's right around 100 basis points of margin headwind now.\n And then the last thing that I would add is just the accounting change. So factoring in the LIFO accounting change in Q1, that's how you get to that 140 basis points of margin improvement for the full year and the new range of 26% to 27%. \nSabrina Abrams: And then what are you guys seeing in terms of electronics demand? And what are you hearing from your customers? Because this market has been pressured for 5 or 6 quarters now, but clearly, the comps are getting easier. Has this started to bottom out yet? \nMichael Larsen: Well, so I think it's a little bit of a mixed picture there. I think last year, we talked a lot about the challenges in the semi-related businesses. Last year, those were down order of magnitude 20% to 25%. Now -- we're talking about just to kind of size things. These businesses represent about 15% of the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 3% of total ITW revenues. So just to kind of put things in context.\n The positive news is that the semi markets appear to have bottomed out. So this is no longer a drag on the overall growth rate of the segment. They were actually maybe slightly positive here in Q1, but the inevitable recovery has been deferred. And so when exactly that will come, whether that's in the second half or next year, is hard to tell. It's not factored into our guidance, as we told you today.\n And then we're seeing a little bit of what I said in the script, a little bit of pressure in the electronic assembly side of things. So this is maybe more tied to consumer electronics, and that's what drove electronics being down 8% here in the first quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. \nMircea Dobre: And I'll join the chorus here. Karen, all the best in retirement and really appreciate all the help over these years. \nKaren Fletcher: Thanks, Mig. \nMircea Dobre: One question I had was about EMEA, which frankly came in a little bit better than I would have guessed. I guess one of the themes during this earnings season has been that Europe, frankly, has not been that great. So I'm kind of curious what you're seeing there? Is it just a function of the Specialty kind of onetime items that might have helped Europe in the quarter? Or is there kind of more green shoots to talk about in Europe? \nMichael Larsen: I mean the big driver in Europe here from a dollar standpoint was the Specialty Products, these 2 equipment businesses here, and the timing around some of those orders, as Specialty was up 20% here in the first quarter. But overall, I'd say pretty stable. Automotive was up 2%, Test & Measurement and Electronics up 5%, Food Equipment about flat. That's a little bit of an anomaly that will return to more positive growth as we go through the year.\n And then smaller businesses. Welding down a little bit and Polymers & Fluids down a little bit. But overall -- and then Construction obviously remains a drag internationally as it has been for well over a year at this point. So Construction was still down double digit here in the first quarter. But overall, 1% positive organic growth in the first quarter in Europe. \nMircea Dobre: Understood. And since you mentioned Construction, that was going to be my follow-up there. How do you sort of think about the way this segment can progress through the year here? Is there some sort of a stocking effect that we need to be aware of? And can you also clarify a little bit what you're seeing in North America. You talked about resi. I'm curious what you're seeing on the nonresi side of things? \nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think overall, actually, if you think about Construction, the performance in North America I think is a good example of illustration of how the business is outperforming in a very challenging down market. Only to be down 3% in a market that, if you look at all the key metrics, is certainly down a lot more than that is pretty impressive. Residential/remodel, we said down 1%. I mean the home centers are actually down a little bit more than that.\n And on the commercial side, to your question, that continues to be soft. The commercial side is down. I mean, it's a fairly small part of the overall business, about 20% of the global business, maybe even a little bit less than that. That business was down in the low teens here in the first quarter. But overall, pretty resilient performance in a challenging market, and we expect that frankly to remain that way as we go through the balance of the year.\n If you look at our guidance last time we were together, we said we expected Construction to be down 1% to 3% and I'd certainly put them in that category. And then what's really helping drive some of the performance here is the margin performance. Again, for our Construction business to be delivering 29% plus margins is pretty remarkable without any volume leverage. \nErin Linnihan: And I think we'll take one more question, please. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. \nMatthew Pan: This is Matthew Pan from Julian Mitchell's team at Barclays. Just one, if you could dial in on the TME margins, they were down year-over-year. Can they expand in 2024 overall? \nMichael Larsen: The short answer is yes. And I think one of the reasons, as I said in the prepared remarks that Test & Measurement margins were down in the first quarter is really the strong performance of the MTS business, which grew at 20% plus organic, which is certainly great performance. But due to the fact that we're only 2 years in, in terms of implementing the ITW business model, margins are in the mid-teens in that business. And so there's a negative mix effect that diluted the margins in Test & Measurement by about 250 basis points.\n Now as we go forward, starting Q2 and then through the balance of the year, we do expect that margins will improve from here in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. If you just look at kind of where we were historically, we're going to be back to kind of the mid-20s here for the full year is the current expectation. So like in every segment, including in Test & Measurement and Electronics, we expect to improve margins on a year-over-year basis. So... \nChristopher O'Herlihy: Yes. In Test & Measurement and Electronics, I would just add that there's an extremely fertile environment for innovation, which will underpin margin progression going forward in that segment. \nMichael Larsen: Yes. \nMatthew Pan: Got it. And just a quick follow-up. The free cash flow was down year-over-year in Q1. Is that just a working capital build? And then what are your thoughts on Q2? Is that up year-over-year? \nMichael Larsen: Yes. I think if you look at the free cash flow conversion, it's actually pretty close to kind of normal seasonality. Working capital, if you look at the inventory, it's certainly a decline on a year-over-year basis. It looks like an increase from year-end in Q1. You have to factor out this LIFO inventory accounting change, which added $117 million of inventory in the first quarter. If you do that, you'll see that inventory was actually flat in the quarter relative to year-end, when typically we see a 5% increase or about $85 million of inventory increase in the first quarter, which the team was able to offset.\n Now that said, our months on hand are still elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. And so pre-COVID, we were in the low 2s months on hand. We're right around 3. Certainly, some improvement, but we believe that there is a lot more opportunity here to drive those inventory levels back to kind of pre-COVID levels given that supply chain has normalized. And so as a result of that, you should expect continued strong free cash flow performance as we go through the year. And that's consistent with the guidance we gave today, which is a conversion of 100% plus for the full year.\n So I think overall kind of typical performance in Q1, and more to come as we go through the balance of the year in terms of reducing our inventory levels, which will result in strong free cash flow, as you've come to expect from ITW. \nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. And with that, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Larsen",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, we delivered a solid start to the year with some high-quality execution in a pretty challenging demand environment as expected. \n Despite an organic revenue decline of 0.6%, operating income grew 4% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.4% as enterprise initiative contributed 140 basis points. \n EPS increased 5% to $2.44, excluding a onetime item. Our free cash flow was $494 million, and we repurchased $375 million of our own shares during the quarter as planned. EPS increased 17% to $2.73, and operating margin expanded 420 basis points to 28.4%.\n As you saw this morning, our GAAP results include a onetime LIFO inventory accounting change that resulted in a favorable pretax impact of $117 million to cost of revenue equal to $0.29 a share. In Q1, we made the decision to transition from the LIFO to FIFO inventory accounting method for all of our U.S. businesses, because it is a more consistent and simpler method for valuing inventory across our operations. \n In summary, Q1 results were as expected in the current environment, and growth rates are projected to improve as we go through the balance of the year. Our margin and profitability performance continues to be strong, and we're solidly on track to deliver on our guidance, which I will discuss in a few slides. \n Please turn to Slide 4 for a look at organic growth by geography. As you can see, the 4% decline in North America was partially offset by positive growth internationally, as Europe grew 1% and Asia Pacific grew 6%, led by China up 15%. Excluding the 23% growth rate in our Chinese automotive OEM business, organic growth in China was still up 7%. \n For the full year and for our usual process, which is based on current levels of demand, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in both North America and Europe, with Asia Pacific up in the mid-single digits, led by China.\n Moving on to segment results and starting with the Automotive OEM segment, which delivered solid organic growth of 3% despite North America being down 6% as Europe grew 2% and China grew 23%, driven by continued strong penetration and market share gains. For the full year, we continue to expect solid above-market growth with our typical penetration gains of 2% to 3% and continued outgrowth in China. \n Margin and profitability performance was strong as margins improved by 370 basis points to 19.8%, and enterprise initiatives contributed more than 200 basis points. We continue to make solid progress on the margin enhancement plan in this segment, and we are firmly on track to deliver margins in the low to mid-20s by 2026, which you will recall is what we said we would do at our Investor Day last year.\n Turning to Slide 5. Food Equipment organic revenue declined 1% as expected against a tough comparison of plus 16% in the first quarter last year. Equipment was down 4%, and service grew 3%. And by region, North America declined 2% due to a particularly difficult comparison of plus 21%. On a positive note, the retail business was up 10%, fueled by new product launches and overall North America order activity in Q1 was pretty encouraging across the board. International revenue was flat with Europe down 1% and Asia Pacific up 6%. \n While 5 of our 7 segments improved their margins in Q1, Food Equipment margins declined modestly to 26% as a result of focused capacity investments to support and accelerate continued above-market organic growth in our very attractive service business. Looking forward, we expect margins to continue to improve sequentially as we go through the year. \n Turning to Test & Measurement and Electronics. Organic revenue was down modestly as Test & Measurement grew 2% despite a tough comparison of plus 12%. Electronics was down 8% due to challenging near-term demand trends in electronic assembly. The recent MTS acquisition continues to perform well and grew more than 20%. With margins that are improving, but still in the mid-teens, this created a mix headwind for this segment and diluted segment margins by about 250 basis points. \n Looking ahead, we expect Test & Measurement and Electronics margins to improve from here as we go through the balance of the year. \n Moving on to Slide 6. And as expected, Welding faced a tough demand environment and year-over-year comparison of plus 10%, which resulted in a decline of 3% in Q1. Equipment declined 2% and consumables were down 6%. Industrial sales declined 1% versus an 18% comparison, and the commercial side was down 6%. By region, North America declined 3% against the comparison of plus 10% and international declined 8%. \n On a positive note, operating margin improved 80 basis points to 32.7% with a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. Organic revenue in Polymers & Fluids declined modestly as Automotive Aftermarket was down 2%, and both Fluids and Polymers were essentially flat in the quarter. On a geographic basis, North America declined 5% and international grew 5%, led by China. Operating margins improved 104 basis points to 25.8%.\n Turning to Slide 7. Near-term demand trends in Construction Products continued to be challenging on a global basis as organic revenue declined 7% in Q1. North America was down 3% as the residential and renovation business was down 1%. And international markets remained soft as Europe was down 11% and Australia and New Zealand was down 12%. On a positive note, operating margin improved 190 basis points to 29.4%, driven primarily by another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives. \n Finally, Specialty Products. Organic revenue growth was up 6%, due primarily to the timing of large equipment orders in 2 European businesses. As a result, international was up 19% and North America was down 1%. \n As we have talked about before, we're working to reposition the Specialty segment for consistent above-market organic growth, which involves some strategic portfolio work and more significant product line simplification as we go forward.\n Operating margin improved 410 basis points to 29.7%, driven by operating leverage and a solid contribution from enterprise initiatives.\n With that, let's move to Slide 8 for an update on our full year 2024 guidance. With Q1 results that were right in line with our expectations, we're solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 performance targets and guidance. Looking ahead and starting with the top line, we do see some positives in terms of stable demand, more favorable comparisons year-over-year as we move forward, a normalized pricing and inflationary environment, new product launches, and no meaningful headwind from inventory destocking. \n Per our usual process, our organic growth guidance of 1% to 3% is based on current run rates adjusted for typical seasonality. Operating margin is expected to improve by 140 basis points at the midpoint to a range of 26% to 27%, which includes more than 100 basis points contribution from enterprise initiatives and 50 basis points from the onetime item in Q1. \n As I mentioned on our last call, every segment is projecting to improve their operating margin performance, again, in 2024, with another solid contribution from enterprise initiatives across the board. After-tax return on capital is expected to remain firmly above 30%, and we expect strong free cash flows, again, with conversion greater than net income. \n As you saw this morning, we raised our full year GAAP EPS guidance to a new range of $10.30 to $10.70, which now includes $0.30 of EPS from the Q1 inventory accounting change. Setting that item aside, our operational guidance remains essentially unchanged as we expect a combined headwind of about $0.30 from higher interest expense, currency and income taxes, with an expected tax rate in the range of 24% to 24.5%. \n In terms of cadence for the year, we expect our first half, second half EPS split to be about 50-50 this year, as we factor in the onetime item in the first quarter, which compares to our typical split of 49-51, so slightly less back-end loaded than usual. \n To wrap things up, as expected, the ITW team continues to execute at a very high level in a challenging near-term demand environment, which we anticipate will improve as we go through the balance of the year based on current levels of demand and more favorable comparison. In addition, our first quarter results came in as expected, and we are solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 guidance. \n On a separate note, today is Karen Fletcher's last ITW earnings call. Over the last 6 years, Karen has been instrumental in articulating ITW's unique and differentiated competitive advantages and our plan to leverage them to their full potential to you, the investment community, in a clear and compelling manner. \n In doing so, she has helped us position ITW as one of the world's highest quality, best performing, and most respected industrial companies. Please join Chris and me in thanking Karen, for her many contributions to ITW and wishing her all the best in retirement. Thank you, Karen. And with that, Erin, I'll turn it back to you. I think that was 4 questions in one, Jamie. Well, I'm going to try... I'm going to try my best here. So the comment on Food Equipment. I think for many of our segments, if you take a step back, these growth rates are a little unusual for us, which is really driven, as we said, by these really significant challenging comparisons that we're dealing with, including in Food Equipment.\n So the additional color, even though we're not necessarily a backlog-driven company, was directed around the order activity in North America, which grew double digit in the first quarter here, and which I think gives some additional credibility. What we're saying is that we are expecting a return to more typical growth rates here, including in Food Equipment as we go forward.\n The margin pressure, the margin impact is about 100 basis points in Food Equipment here in Q1 and Q2. And it's really as a result of taking advantage of a huge growth opportunity that's sitting right in front of us in our service business. So what we're talking about is adding a significant number of service technicians to help us meet the demand in one of the most attractive parts of our Food Equipment business. And as you know, we're the only captive OEM with the service business, which is a huge competitive advantage for us in this segment. So I think those were the 2 questions around food equipment. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Chris? And then on Specialty, the organic growth rate here was really driven by large equipment orders and the timing around those in 2 of our businesses in Europe. What we're trying to articulate on a go-forward basis is that we still expect meaningful PLS, product line simplification, as we move forward and strategically reposition this business for 4% plus growth on a consistent basis. And so we still expect a meaningful impact from that as we move forward.\n And I think kind of what we're saying is don't count on 6% organic growth as we move forward. We had guided to this segment at our last call to be down 1% to 3%. And so please keep that in mind. And the same is true for the margins. I mean, I think what you're seeing here on the margins is what happens when we get some growth in these businesses and the operating leverage here contributing in a meaningful way to 29.7% operating margins in the Specialty segment. I think that is not -- on a go-forward basis, that's Q1, both growth rate and margins are a little bit of an anomaly, and I think we expect to return to more -- still very profitable margins kind of in the high 20s, but maybe not something that starts with a 29. So Tami, as you know, we don't give quarterly guidance. What I will tell you to try and help you out here a little bit is that if you model kind of current levels of demand or run rate, as we call them, into Q2, what we're typically seeing is a step-up in revenues in the low single digits from Q1 to Q2. And in Automotive OEM, actually a meaningful improvement in the builds from Q1 to Q2, an increase in the low to mid-single digits there as well. So you will see slightly higher revenues in Q2.\n And given that the comparison gets easier on a year-over-year basis, we were up 5% in Q1 last year, up 3% in Q2, it is certainly possible that we'll see slightly positive organic growth here in Q2. But the more meaningful step-up really starts in the second half of the year, which is kind of what's implied in our guidance here.\n So think about it maybe as kind of flattish in the first half, maybe slightly positive in Q2, and then an improvement in the second half of the year, as the comparisons year-over-year improve by 4 points relative to the first half of the year. So in the second half last year, revenues were essentially flat, and at current run rates, you'd expect to see positive organic growth rates in the low single digits in the second half.\n And I might just add for those keeping track that there are 2 extra shipping days in the second half this year compared to the second half last year, which at least mathematically should provide some additional revenue growth for us. Well, what I would say, Tami, is that we're really pleased with our first quarter operational performance here, as you saw in the margin rates. And if you exclude the onetime item, 140 basis points from initiatives, 120 basis points of overall margin expansion, and margins at 25.4% is a pretty significant accomplishment here for the first quarter. And we do expect, as we typically do going through the year, that margins improved sequentially from here on out. So you should see a modest improvement sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and then again into Q3 and Q4.\n The only thing I would highlight as you think about the second quarter is, similar to last year, we do expect some higher restructuring expense in the second quarter, and these are all projects that are tied to a typical 80/20 front-to-back projects. These are not tied to any concerns around volume growth whatsoever. I don't want you to think that this is pure planned restructuring for the second quarter.\n And as I said, just real quick on Q1, again, 5 of 7 segments improved margins in the current environment, including with revenues down in 5 of 7 segments. And we expect, consistent with our bottom-up planning process here for the full year, that every segment will improve margins as we go through the year and on a year-over-year basis. Yes. I think as you pointed out, Steve, the big driver is obviously our Automotive OEM business, up 23%. And the team there is doing a great job growing content on new vehicles, including on the EV side, and gaining market share. Even excluding those, as I said, China was still up 7% year-over-year.\n Strong contribution from Polymers & Fluids. Some of that is tied also to market share gains on the EV side of things and the bonding of some of these batteries in the assembly process, where we have a really unique and differentiated product. Specialty products also contributed. Test & Measurement grew and Food Equipment. So across the board, really solid performance in China. \n And moving forward, we'd say that looks pretty sustainable as we go into Q2, and then the second half, the comps get a little bit more difficult. But as I said, for the full year, China should be up in the mid- to high-single digits here, which is certainly encouraging. And again, I think it speaks to kind of the benefit of being as diversified from a geography standpoint as we are. And so certainly, some challenges in the first quarter in North America, but offset in Europe and in China, which is really a big benefit for us. Yes. I mean, I think, I wouldn't expect a lot of regression from where we are. These are absolutely sustainable here in the 19%-plus range. And I think that's probably where we'll end up for the year, maybe a little bit better in the back half. Some of that depends on the build assumptions. There might be a little bit of restructuring here in the second quarter. But big picture, I'd say, Automotive, really solid progress here on a year-over-year basis. We expect full year margins in the 19%, almost 20% range, an improvement of 240 basis points on a year-over-year basis, and lots of room to go as we work through our margin enhancement plan. Yes. So nothing unusual in terms of the margins in Q1, and sustainable, but lots of room for improvement from here. I think, Andy, you're right. We don't want to update our guidance for the segments every quarter. And what I will tell you is, given our portfolio, there's always going to be some puts and takes. And I think that's, again, I just talked about the competitive advantage with being as diversified as we are geographically. And the same is true when you look at this portfolio of businesses. You're always going to have some things that maybe are a little more pressured from a market standpoint in the short term. And those are typically offset by segments that are performing a little bit better. And it all kind of evens out to that 1% to 3% organic growth guidance.\n So I'm not really going to go through segment by segment here, but I'd say there's definitely some puts and takes, but overall, not too far off from what we talked about on the last call. And certainly, our full year guidance, we're firmly on track to deliver on that. Yes. I think the big driver here is really the comparisons year-over-year. That's driving the growth rates as we go forward. And so just like I said, for the total company, for Welding, it's also true that as we go through the year, these comparisons get easier. 10% growth in Welding in the first quarter last year is obviously not a sustainable growth rate. And so it wasn't really a big surprise that organic revenue was down 3%.\n I'd say on a positive note, and this is true not just in Welding, but across the board, last year, we dealt with some meaningful headwind from excess inventory at our customers and in the channel. And to the point of magnitude, a percentage point of drag on the organic growth rate last year, that is essentially behind us at this point. So that's kind of the positive news across the board, including in Welding. \n And then we're back to a normal pricing environment. We've got an exciting lineup in terms of new products that are being launched here in the near term. And so you put all of that together, and we feel really good about the outlook here in Welding. Top line, obviously, but maybe I will just highlight the margin performance again. The fact that with revenues down, margins at 32% plus, operating margins is really strong and speaks to the focus that we have on really quality of growth over quantity of growth. And the team is executing well on that plan. Yes. I think there's not a lot of change from what we talked about on the last call. We are maintaining our operational guidance here kind of big picture at 1% to 3% organic growth. There is some positive operating leverage. We expect slightly more than 100 basis points of enterprise initiatives, which is based on the strong performance here in Q1 at 140 basis points.\n Price/cost has essentially normalized at this point. So there is some modest favorability from price/cost as we go through the year. Maybe a little bit more in Q1 versus the back end of the year. And then we have done a good job, as we talked about on the last call, managing some of the cost pressures from an inflationary standpoint around employee-related cost benefits. That used to be a headwind. Order of magnitude, we used to talk about 150, 200 basis points, and that's right around 100 basis points of margin headwind now.\n And then the last thing that I would add is just the accounting change. So factoring in the LIFO accounting change in Q1, that's how you get to that 140 basis points of margin improvement for the full year and the new range of 26% to 27%. Well, so I think it's a little bit of a mixed picture there. I think last year, we talked a lot about the challenges in the semi-related businesses. Last year, those were down order of magnitude 20% to 25%. Now -- we're talking about just to kind of size things. These businesses represent about 15% of the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment, 3% of total ITW revenues. So just to kind of put things in context.\n The positive news is that the semi markets appear to have bottomed out. So this is no longer a drag on the overall growth rate of the segment. They were actually maybe slightly positive here in Q1, but the inevitable recovery has been deferred. And so when exactly that will come, whether that's in the second half or next year, is hard to tell. It's not factored into our guidance, as we told you today.\n And then we're seeing a little bit of what I said in the script, a little bit of pressure in the electronic assembly side of things. So this is maybe more tied to consumer electronics, and that's what drove electronics being down 8% here in the first quarter. I mean the big driver in Europe here from a dollar standpoint was the Specialty Products, these 2 equipment businesses here, and the timing around some of those orders, as Specialty was up 20% here in the first quarter. But overall, I'd say pretty stable. Automotive was up 2%, Test & Measurement and Electronics up 5%, Food Equipment about flat. That's a little bit of an anomaly that will return to more positive growth as we go through the year.\n And then smaller businesses. Welding down a little bit and Polymers & Fluids down a little bit. But overall -- and then Construction obviously remains a drag internationally as it has been for well over a year at this point. So Construction was still down double digit here in the first quarter. But overall, 1% positive organic growth in the first quarter in Europe. Yes. I think overall, actually, if you think about Construction, the performance in North America I think is a good example of illustration of how the business is outperforming in a very challenging down market. Only to be down 3% in a market that, if you look at all the key metrics, is certainly down a lot more than that is pretty impressive. Residential/remodel, we said down 1%. I mean the home centers are actually down a little bit more than that.\n And on the commercial side, to your question, that continues to be soft. The commercial side is down. I mean, it's a fairly small part of the overall business, about 20% of the global business, maybe even a little bit less than that. That business was down in the low teens here in the first quarter. But overall, pretty resilient performance in a challenging market, and we expect that frankly to remain that way as we go through the balance of the year.\n If you look at our guidance last time we were together, we said we expected Construction to be down 1% to 3% and I'd certainly put them in that category. And then what's really helping drive some of the performance here is the margin performance. Again, for our Construction business to be delivering 29% plus margins is pretty remarkable without any volume leverage. The short answer is yes. And I think one of the reasons, as I said in the prepared remarks that Test & Measurement margins were down in the first quarter is really the strong performance of the MTS business, which grew at 20% plus organic, which is certainly great performance. But due to the fact that we're only 2 years in, in terms of implementing the ITW business model, margins are in the mid-teens in that business. And so there's a negative mix effect that diluted the margins in Test & Measurement by about 250 basis points.\n Now as we go forward, starting Q2 and then through the balance of the year, we do expect that margins will improve from here in the Test & Measurement and Electronics segment. If you just look at kind of where we were historically, we're going to be back to kind of the mid-20s here for the full year is the current expectation. So like in every segment, including in Test & Measurement and Electronics, we expect to improve margins on a year-over-year basis. So... Yes. Yes. I think if you look at the free cash flow conversion, it's actually pretty close to kind of normal seasonality. Working capital, if you look at the inventory, it's certainly a decline on a year-over-year basis. It looks like an increase from year-end in Q1. You have to factor out this LIFO inventory accounting change, which added $117 million of inventory in the first quarter. If you do that, you'll see that inventory was actually flat in the quarter relative to year-end, when typically we see a 5% increase or about $85 million of inventory increase in the first quarter, which the team was able to offset.\n Now that said, our months on hand are still elevated relative to pre-COVID levels. And so pre-COVID, we were in the low 2s months on hand. We're right around 3. Certainly, some improvement, but we believe that there is a lot more opportunity here to drive those inventory levels back to kind of pre-COVID levels given that supply chain has normalized. And so as a result of that, you should expect continued strong free cash flow performance as we go through the year. And that's consistent with the guidance we gave today, which is a conversion of 100% plus for the full year.\n So I think overall kind of typical performance in Q1, and more to come as we go through the balance of the year in terms of reducing our inventory levels, which will result in strong free cash flow, as you've come to expect from ITW."

            "content": "Thank you, Erin, and good morning everyone. While the near-term demand environment across the majority of our segments was certainly challenging as we anticipated, the ITW team delivered a solid start to the year as our first quarter results came in as expected. And we remain solidly on track to deliver on our 2024 performance targets.\n Starting with the top line. Organic growth was down 0.6% as 5 of 7 segments declined in the face of a tough demand environment and versus some difficult comparisons year-over-year. Those comparisons are more favorable for the balance of the year, and based on current levels of demand, we are confident that we will deliver on our full year performance targets, including organic growth of 1% to 3%.\n The ITW team continued to execute at a very high level and delivered strong margin and profitability performance in the first quarter. Excluding a onetime inventory accounting item, quarterly operating income grew 4%, as operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 25.4%, with a strong contribution from enterprise initiatives of 140 basis points, as we continue to make solid progress towards our goal of 30% operating margin by 2030. GAAP EPS of $2.73 increased 17%, and excluding the onetime item, we grew EPS 5% to $2.44. The free cash flow conversion rate of 68% was in line with normal Q1 levels.\n Looking ahead, where we did raise our GAAP EPS and margin guidance for the year to account for the onetime item, our operational guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect that current levels of demand across the majority of our end markets and favorable year-over-year comparisons will translate to positive organic growth through the balance of the year. Combined with our continued strong margin and profitability performance, we are confident that ITW is firmly on track and well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 guidance. \n In concluding my remarks, I want to thank all of our ITW colleagues around the world for their exceptional efforts and for their dedication to serving our customers with excellence, and driving continuous progress on our path to ITW's full potential. \n I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail, as well as our updated full year guidance. Michael? No. I would just, I guess, accentuate the point of differentiation aspect of the service business within food with unique captive manufacturer. And this is a necessary investment at this point to capitalize on what is an undoubtedly stellar growth opportunity on the service side for us. Yes. And Steve, I suppose just to support that, I mean, this is very much an improvement plan that's on track to get back to the low to mid-20s margins by 2026, as we outlined at our Investor Day, largely through a combination of, over that time, volume recovery, enterprise initiatives, and higher-margin innovation. So both in '23 and again in '24, we're very much tracking on that cadence with respect to what we outlined at our Investor Day last year. Yes. In Test & Measurement and Electronics, I would just add that there's an extremely fertile environment for innovation, which will underpin margin progression going forward in that segment."
