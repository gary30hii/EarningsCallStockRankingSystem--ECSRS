All participants are now in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for the replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends.  In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our full year operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our 2020 financial results and liquidity position. After which, Ward will discuss market trends and our 2021 outlook. A question-and-answer session will follow.  I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. By all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta, we're proud to have extended our long track record of financial, operational and safety excellence, particularly in a year filled with unprecedented disruption.  Martin Marietta set new performance records, delivering almost profitable year and the best safety performance in our company's history. These impressive results demonstrate our resilient business model and our team's commitment to Martin Marietta's vision and successful execution of our proven Strategic Operating Analysis and Review or SOAR plan.  As noted, today's discussion focuses on our full year results and 2021 outlook. Before doing so, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record setting fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved solid shipment and pricing growth across all product lines as construction activity stabilized from the spring and summer months when we saw a greater impact from COVID-19. These top-line improvements, along with our steadfast focus on cost controls, resulted in 7% growth in consolidated total revenues, 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA and a 40% increase in diluted earnings per share.  For the full year, we established new records for products and services revenues, profitability and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, full year consolidated products and services revenues increased to $4.4 billion, consolidated gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to nearly $1.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $11.54, an 18% improvement.  Martin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. Operating our business safely sets the foundation for our longstanding financial success. Martin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or exceed world class safety levels. We achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020. And for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved a company-wide world class lost time incident rate. These superior financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and agility of our nearly 9,000 talented employees. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic while remaining focused on being good wingmen, working safely and efficiently together and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders\u2019 needs.  With that overview, let's now turn to our full year operating performance. Aggregate shipments declined 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand and headwinds from COVID-19 disruptions. However, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from healthy single-family housing activity. Aggregates\u2019 average selling price increased 4% on a mix adjusted basis, in line with our expectations. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, a testament to this product line\u2019s resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies.  The disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with attractive underlying market fundamentals will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward. Our cement operations established new records for shipments, which increased 2% to nearly 4 million tons. Large project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector. Pricing increased 3% on a mix adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the State of Texas. We expect our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs and April 2021 price increases. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020. Concrete pricing increased 2%. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business established a new record for asphalt shipments, increasing 15% to 3 million tons. This growth reflected solid underlying product demand together with carryover work following a weather challenged 2019. Asphalt pricing increased nearly 3%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full year financial results and liquidity. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Driving this achievement was our Building Materials business, which delivered record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase. Our Upstream Materials businesses, namely, aggregates and cement, established all-time records for both full year product revenues and gross profit. Aggregates\u2019 product gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 30.6%, a new record, and unit profitability improved 8%. These accomplishments, which resulted from strong pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. The Cement business benefited from the planned kiln maintenance outage that occurred through the end of 2019. The timing of that outage resulted in some expenses being recognized in 2019 versus early in 2020. More importantly, that and other capital investments have dramatically improved our cement operations. We achieved 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which facilitated increased throughput and fixed cost absorption at both our Midlothian and Hunter plants. These factors, combined with mix adjusted pricing strength and lower fuel costs, contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in Cement product gross margin to 37.8%. Our targeted downstream businesses also delivered solid full year financial results. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin increased 10 basis points to 8.4% as pricing growth offset higher raw material costs. Asphalt and paving achieved gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth. Our Magnesia Specialties business returned to revenue and profitability growth during the fourth quarter. The 12% top-line improvement in the quarter, however, was not enough to offset demand declines experienced earlier in the year. As a result, full year product revenues decreased 12% to $221 million. We anticipate fourth quarter strength in line with chemicals demand to continue in 2021, now that steel utilization has rebounded from last summer's COVID-19-driven trough and our cobalt customers are resuming activity. Impressively, product gross margin improved 80 basis points to 40.6% as we proactively responded to lower shipments with effective cost control measures. Turning now to cash generation, capital allocation and liquidity. Martin Marietta ended 2020 with the strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased 9%, driven by earnings growth. We continue to balance our longstanding disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain: focus on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating profile. For 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock. In August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and continuing Martin Marietta's track record of dividend growth. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. We ended 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which offers us the flexibility to pursue accretive investment opportunities. Our solid balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion of availability on our credit facilities, provides the financial strength for Martin Marietta to respond and to execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue profitably growing our business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2021 outlook.\nHoward Nye: Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets and key geographies. We expect these trends to drive construction-led aggregates-intensive growth. Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, continues to prove resilient. With the 1-year extension of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act at current funding levels, state and local governments have the visibility needed to plan, design and award transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Importantly, estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 Departments of Transportation, or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to us, representing 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues. Additionally, DOTs were recently granted nearly $10 billion of targeted relief as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Act passed in December 2020 to help offset pandemic-driven transportation revenue shortfalls. This funding assistance has the benefit of no state matching requirements. Based on preliminary estimates, over $2 billion of this assistance will be apportioned to Martin Marietta's top 5 states. Over the medium to long-term, we anticipate voter-approved state and local transportation measures and passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program package to promote multi-year growth in product demand. In November 2020, voters sent a powerful message of support for state and local transportation investment approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest ever approval rating. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $14 billion in one-time and recurring transportation funding, of which 82% is in Texas, our top revenue-generating state. Bipartisan support exists for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the United States House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills. We believe this 117th Congress creates a path toward advancing a notable increase in funding over the FAST Act. We're optimistic that agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating meaningful benefits in 2022 and beyond. We expect increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of 2020 shipments. Non-residential construction should continue to benefit from accelerating e-commerce and remote work trends that require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metros of Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Atlanta. Importantly, this type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the size, scale and structure of these projects. Light commercial and retail construction will remain comparatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed. Over the longer term, light non-residential activity will benefit from the attractive collateral effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments. Single-family housing is poised for multi-year growth returning to more normalized levels during this economic cycle. We believe Martin Marietta's leading Southeastern and Southwestern footprint positions the company to be a notable beneficiary of these trends given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Single-family housing is 2 times to 3 times more aggregates-intensive than multi-family construction, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of 2020 shipments. In summary, we're confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business. As disclosed in today's release, we've returned to providing full year annual guidance. We currently expect 2021 aggregate shipment growth to range from up 1% to up 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale that will support our near-term shipment levels. We remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs. For 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, which become effective from January 1 to April 1, to increase in a range of up 3% to up 5%. Combined with contributions from our Cement, Downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1,350 million to $1,450 million. Keep in mind, when comparing this guidance range to prior year, we're not anticipating the same level of non-recurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020. To conclude, we're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We're also extremely optimistic about our future. Martin Marietta has a strong foundation, thanks to our solid balance sheet and the investments we've made in our assets, people and capabilities. Due to our work over the last several years, Martin Marietta is uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long-term. Importantly, the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, coupled with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation and adherence to robust health protocols will continue to enhance Martin Marietta's solid foundation for enduring success. As we move forward, we have the resources, team and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth. We're confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational and safety performance and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to our other stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. I show our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. \nKathryn Thompson: Nice results today, given a tough market. Wanted to focus on Cement. If you could discuss the pricing dynamics you saw in the quarter, and importantly, your thoughts on both volume and pricing going forward? And then just really kind of a follow-up related to cement somewhat, which is more on infrastructure. Do you see any potential air pockets in lettings, given reduced revenues? And when might that be seen, if ever? And how might that impact cement volumes and also aggregate volumes?\nHoward Nye: Well, Happy New Year to you, Kathryn, that's a mouthful. We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember how we spoke about cement when we acquired it with TXI, we indicated we believe Texas cement pricing would start to act like aggregate pricing. That's exactly what we saw in this quarter. What I think is doubly important about that and impressive, keep in mind, for much of the year, we were not in a position to go and see our customers. So to see that type of performance on a mix adjusted basis is actually quite impressive. Keep in mind too, although you don't see it in the numbers, if we're looking at type 1 and type 2 cement, that was actually selling for closer to 4% up as opposed to 3% up. So if we're really looking at the bread-and-butter products, it looks really quite impressive.  If we look at overall cement dynamics in the State, Texas is a nice place to be in any heavy side building materials business. Because particularly for cement right now, demand outstrips supply, and that's always a good place to start. We think that's particularly going to be the case as we go through the year in North Texas this year. So again, that feeds directly into our operations in Midlothian. Equally, the marketplace that we're seeing around Hunter is actually quite attractive as well.  What we see from a volume perspective has been driven by a series of things. One, by some big jobs. So in the North, we're seeing Loop 12. We're seeing I-635, which is also known as the LBJ. If you go down toward South Texas, what's going on relative to the Grand Parkway has been nicely generative or utilizing cement and ready-mix and aggregates and all the way through. So we think the outlook is frankly as good as we just saw in Q4. If you're looking really more to what potential air pockets could be, I'll tell you very candidly, in Texas, we don't see it, Kathryn. A couple of things lead me to believe that. One, the FY '21 lettings in Texas are actually 25% over where they were last year. In other words, we're looking for about $9.5 billion worth of lettings. The other 2 pieces to keep in mind is the 2021 revenue streams that we're seeing either coming through Prop 7 and Prop 1 in Texas are really quite healthy. So we're looking at transfers of about $2.5 billion this year relative to Prop 7 and about $1.2 billion relative to Prop 1.  Something else that's worth keeping in mind, too, is when we were looking at the COVID relief that's called into different DOTs, Texas was the recipient of almost $914 million. Again, we spoke to the fact that those have not come encumbered with any particular state match. So for a state that already found itself in a very good position to have that extra money come in as well gives us a sense that we're in a very, very good place.  As an ultimate reminder, Texas has rained a fund of $10.5 billion that they have not tapped. So as we're looking at Texas, both near term, medium-term and long-term, we like very much what we see. So I hope that's responsive to your series of questions, Kathryn.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Congratulations, Ward, on a really good quarter. And a good outlook statement as well. It's nice to see guidance again. Just staying on Cement. I guess how are you thinking about the guide that you provided $460 million to $500 million, what have you got for price versus volume in there? If you could help me with that? And also, it appear that maybe there's limited operating leverage in that guidance as well. I'm just wondering if that's maybe some of the kiln expenses from 2020 that got pulled into 2019 if those come back and maybe that's why you leave it on the leverage. And just if I could also add to that, you must be feeling some pinch points in terms of capacity in cement at this point. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking longer term about your capacity footprint. Do you flex your shipments with import tons? Or do you invest capital either organically or through acquisitions in building your capacity? Or maybe you're just happy with what you've got. If you could talk about that?\nHoward Nye: No, happy to, David. Thank you very much for your questions. We'll start with respect to pricing. So as we think about pricing in the Texas marketplace today, what we're seeing are price increases out there that have been put out. We put out a $9 a ton price increase effective in April. We've seen others that customers have shown us that have been closer to $6. So I think that gives you at least some base to think about relative to pricing for the year. I think equally, as we look at the likelihood of price increases hitting in different percentages, clearly, North Texas is going to look stronger than South Texas is. Central is going to be just fine. I think to your point, if it's going to be tight anywhere this year on cement tonnage, it's likely more in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, meaning Midlothian. And so we'll just have to watch that as the year goes on.  One thing I would ask you to do is, and that is you asked a very good question around capacity in Texas, because you're going back to the notion that right now demand is outstripping supply. As you know, we have an Analyst and Investor Day that's coming up later this month. We're going to talk about some of the very specific capital initiatives that we have underway. And I would ask you to wait and listen to what we have to say about that particular process when we're talking to you live later in the month relative to our cement outlook and our aggregates outlook in Texas. With respect to some of the other numbers that you mentioned, you're entirely right relative to rhythm and cadence around kiln maintenance. We did have a relatively lower number of kiln maintenance in 2020. If we're looking at the overall kiln maintenance spend in 2020, it was about $19.7 million. As we're looking to see what it's going to be into the new year, we are looking at a number that's going to be somewhat higher than that. We're looking more at about a $22.7 million number for total kiln maintenance in '21. And so we're looking at some of those puts and takes. But I think that gives you a sense of do we have capacity issues that we need to think about longer and medium term? Yes, we do. Are we in a circumstance that pricing is doing what we thought it would? It absolutely is. Are the dollars that we've put into the kilns having them run at a higher rate of efficiency? There's no doubt that they are.  So if we're looking at kiln reliability, as Jim commented in his commentary, they ran at 90% kiln reliability in the year just ended. The year before, it's at 82%. So we like very much the way that business is going operationally, the way that business is going commercially and what we feel like its future is. So David, I hope that was responsive to your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens, Inc. \nTrey Grooms : So I guess, first off -- and I'm looking at the volume guidance for aggregates, and I appreciate your color and comments on the end markets. But especially on the infrastructure piece, you sound maybe more constructive on that side than we've heard in a while. First, I mean, I want to make sure I'm hearing that right because I'm hearing that you're expecting increased demand versus '20. And with that mix becoming closer to the historic average, even directionally that way implies decent volume growth in that end market. I know you mentioned some details around Texas, but could you touch on some of the other markets you're in, where you're seeing the strength that's given you that increased confidence in that end market?\nHoward Nye: No, happy to, Trey. Thank you very much. As you indicated, we've walked through what some of the numbers look like in Texas. As Jim indicated in his prepared remarks, if we look at Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, those states comprise around 71% of our revenue. So those states are going well, a lot of things good happens for Martin Marietta. As I indicated, I won't go back through all the details that we hit, but we're looking at Texas lettings up 25%. Let's go through the others and I think that will give you a sense of why we've got the degree of confidence that we do. Colorado, which, as you know, in '20 had just a spectacular year. I mean, you heard us reference the fact that our asphalt and paving business in that State had a record year. We're looking at a DOT program in Colorado that we believe is going to be flat year-over-year. And what I'm about to tell you is when we're looking at our top 5 states, yet the worst that we're seeing anywhere is flat, that's not a bad place to be coming off of a record year. So if we're looking at the $10 billion COVID stimulus, about $134 million of those dollars is finding its way to Colorado, which we believe is to bring their DOT program up about even with where it was last year. Now by contrast, our home State, North Carolina, did not have a particularly good year last year. We think North Carolina DOT is in a far better position. And as you know, if we look at this State, historically, it has not only been one of our most profitable. It's been one of our most consistent as well. So we think North Carolina is trending back into an area that makes much more sense for us. To give you a sense of what that means, the FY '21 lettings projection is about $1.3 billion. That's $670 million better than I think people would have expected when they were looking at it last year. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is North Carolina did issue $700 million of build in C bonds. So again, as we're looking at the near-term future of North Carolina, we're really very pleased with that. One thing I will mention as well, the NC First Commission, which I was a part of here in North Carolina, looked at really how North Carolina needs to think about its investment in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And our view was they needed to put at least $20 billion more in infrastructure in the State. So the State is looking at ways to do that. But that's clearly longer term than just this year. If we go to Georgia, again, we think Georgia is relatively flat year-over-year. But if you look at where that State has been sequentially, if we go back to 2016, you'll see a budget that's gone from about $1.7 billion to one that's about $2.1 billion. And then the other thing to keep in mind is Georgia still has ahead of it the major mobility investment program. And the overall goal of that is to have a number of very large projects, about $12 billion to be more specific, underway by 2025 and completed by 2030. And then, of course, the last, the top 5 states is Florida, they're looking at their spending to increase about 20% year-over-year. So again, if we look at the top 5, Texas is better, North Carolina is better. Florida is better and Colorado and Georgia are broadly flat. So when we look at that type of trajectory on something that's around 71% of our revenues in those states, I think that's part of what gives us the confidence that, that we have and the volume outlook that we've offered today.\nTrey Grooms : All right. Ward, if I could sneak one in just for clarity. There was a question about the cement and the maintenance, and you talked about some color around that and some details, which was helpful. On the ag side, Jim, this might be for you. Is there anything there -- obviously, diesel is not going to be the tailwind you experienced in '20. But is there any other cost outside of diesel coming off the year like 2020 when, I mean, from a margin and cost standpoint, you and the team did a great job there. Is there any catch-up on costs that are baked into your guide? Or anything we should be aware of on that front?\nJim Nickolas: Good question, Trey. Now we are anticipating, otherwise, hitting a 60% incremental target for next year, but for the diesel headwind. So our incremental is around 40% because of diesel. We've got about $30 million of higher expense from higher oil prices coming through. And we would add 60% but for that. So -- but otherwise, our costs are well behaved. Quite -- we're expecting them to be sort of well controlled as they were in 2020. We expect that to continue. Hold on to the gains we saw in 2020 and build on those 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari : Ward, on the full year outlook, is there any way we should think about the quarterly cadence of volume growth implied in the guidance? Do you still expect kind of sharper year-over-year volume declines in the first half and then kind of inflecting into the second half? Or any kind of finer point you can put on that?\nHoward Nye: As we look at it, and I think part of what you heard us say earlier, I mean, we're back to the point that we put in full guidance again. So I think that gives you a sense that we've all found a way to manage through this. And I think to that end, Anthony, what I would suggest is a normal rhythm and cadence is probably broadly the right way to think about this. I do think there's going to be a degree to which you'll see some of it that's going to be modestly more in the back half as opposed to the front half. Obviously, Q2 and particularly Q3 were the 2 quarters that were most impacted by COVID. By the time we got to Q4, in many respects, we had a lot of this figured out. And certainly, we had more favorable weather in Q4. So I would look broadly at a rather normal rhythm and cadence, slightly heavier toward half 2 as opposed to half 1. I hope that's helpful.\nAnthony Pettinari : That's very helpful. And then, I mean, to your point, I mean, the volumes have held up better-than-expected over the last 12 months. In terms of what could get you to the high end or the low end of that 1% to 4% aggregates volume guide, is private commercial, is that the biggest question mark for you? Or do you think residential could slow down in the second half? Or are there any particular states? Just wondering if there's maybe a few swing factors for you when you think about 2021 that could get you to the high end or the low end?\nHoward Nye: That's a great question. Here's how I would catch in that. I think we've got a good sense of what public is going to look like, and we think public is going to look better. And I think we have a good sense of what residential is going to look like, and residential is going to look better. And residential is particularly going to look better with respect to single-family. We believe single-family as a percentage of overall housing will return to more normalized percentages. In other words, it's going to be about 80% of housing in the United States. And when we see single-family housing at 1 million starts or 1.1 million or 1.2 million, I will tell you, that's a pretty healthy place for our business. Because here's what happens. That's evidence of new neighborhoods being built. And so if you think about 2 cities that are important to us, think about Atlanta and think about Dallas, both tend to be North-South cities, both tend to be growing more North than South. So what that means is, years ago, you were growing North from Dallas to Plano, now you're growing from Dallas to Frisco and now you're going to be moving North from Frisco to North of Frisco.  As we see new communities come-in in Frisco or as they go into Alpharetta or other places North of Atlanta, new communities need the follow-on effect that you get in non-residential. Now history tells us, depending on geography, that can have a 6 to, let's call it, an 18-month lag behind it. If we're seeing single-family growth in communities and you've got a 6-month lag on that, that can start pushing you toward the higher end of our volume guidance. Because if we think about the different end uses, res infrastructure is going to be better. Residential is going to be better, particularly single-family.  As we land on non-res, as we said comparatively the toughest of the 3 end uses, the heavy side of that, we believe, is going to be good. With warehousing, data, et cetera, all of which are very aggregates-intensive. So some of the swing side to the upper end of that is going to be relative to the drag along effect of the light portion of non-res that we believe will follow continued single-family growth. So that was a mouthful. And I apologize if that was a mouthful, but I hope that was followable.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. \nJerry Revich : Ward, I'm wondering if you could talk about how active your M&A pipeline is at this point? And how much is uncertainty around what tax rates could look like? How is that playing into your appetite for M&A and the overall impact on the M&A market as you see it? \nHoward Nye: Jerry, thanks for the question. What I would say is, if you look at what M&A has done for Martin Marietta through the SOAR years, and by that, I mean, from 2010 today, M&A has been our preferred methodology of growth. It has served us and our owners well. We think it will continue to serve us well. When we think about M&A, we think about it in a long-term strategic view. At the same time, we're not going to go into transactions that we know are not going to be near term attractive deals for us either. In fairness, typically, we're not going to take tax rates much into account in the way that we're looking at M&A. Because we feel like getting the right deal in the right market is the most important thing that we can do for our company near term and long-term. It allows our teams to grow. It allows our company to grow. It lets us grow into markets that we think will be attractive. And at the end of the day, where we believe we can have leading positions.  As you'll recall, we have a leading position in 90% of our markets today. 10 years ago, we had a leading position in 65% of our markets. We're going to be looking at M&A through 2 different lenses. We're going to be looking at it in bolt-on acquisitions in markets that we currently exist. But equally, we will look at potential platform acquisitions in markets in which we would like to grow. As a reminder and we've not been shy about this, we've long talked about the 2050 regional planning that shows what growth is going to look like in the United States between now and 2050. And the short answer is the country is going to add about 140 million people over that time period, and 70% of them will land in one of 11 mega regions. And so if you watch the mega regions and see what -- where they are and if you look at our footprint, the likelihood is we will continue to want to be focused in those mega regions, either with bolt-ons or with platforms.  Relative to our M&A pipeline and our team, they would like to sleep more. But the short answer is they're very busy people right now. They are very talented people. And we're very grateful for them. And our intention is to do all that we can to keep them tired and hungry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from UBS. \nNishu Sood : So I wanted to ask about -- this has obviously been unusually volatile time for the industry, coming off a quarter in which volumes were quite affected by the pandemic. Do you think there was any effect in 4Q of maybe some deferrals, projects that might have been affected by the pandemic being completed in 4Q? And obviously, with the milder weather, it would have been conducive to that. Do you think that had any effect on 4Q?\nHoward Nye: Nishu, number one, welcome back. It's good to hear your voice. Number two, with respect to your question, I'm sure that we would be naive not to assume that there was some that would have been pushed into Q4, simply because Q3 would have been more impacted and the weather was favorable. So I think that's certainly a possibility. What I think we saw more of though is the build of some momentum and saw nice momentum going into four. Experience tells me that contractors are finishing a year in which they don't have good confidence in the next year. Rather than hurry up, they tend to slow down because they want to make sure that they have plenty of work for their workforces as they come into a new year. So what I would say too is, I mean I think that's certainly possible, Nishu, but I equally think what we're seeing, particularly relative to single-family housing and what's tending to follow it and then the overall health of the DOTs in the states in which we are operating, I think those are coalescing to give nice momentum in 4 that we believe persists into '21.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. \nPhilip Ng : Ward, can you provide a little more color on bidding activity and how your backlogs are shaping up broadly. But certainly, any color, particularly on non-res and maybe some of these energy projects that you have talked about in the past that may have gotten pushed out, are you seeing some of that come back as well?\nHoward Nye: Phil, thanks so much for your question. What I would say is the customer backlogs are looking fairly similar in many respects to where they were last year. One thing that's worth remembering is the backlogs really, at this time of the year for customers, only represent about 20% to 35% of what people really think their shipment needs are going to be. But what I would say is overall aggregate tons are modestly up as we talk to our customers right now. If we look at cement tons, they're actually up double-digits right now. If we look at Magnesia Specialties, they're actually up double-digits as well. So I think part of what's important to remember, Phil, is we're going into '21, two parts of our business that have historically been very good, steady parts of our business, meaning North Carolina and Magnesia Specialties did not have the best years in '20 and are both looking at considerably better years coming into the year in '21.  So as we're looking at overall backlogs, they look really quite good for us. The only area that our backlogs are notably off would be in portions of Colorado. And what we're seeing in Colorado, and I think this goes back to your question, is actually right now a very good level of bidding activity in that State. So as we mentioned, we're coming off what was a record year last year in Colorado. And we anticipate it coming into '21, that would almost have to be modestly slower. As I indicated in some of the earlier questions, with some of the COVID money that is coming to Colorado, DOT numbers are broadly even, and now we're seeing much better bidding activity. So I guess what I have to say on that, Phil, is more to come. But I try to give you what we feel like is a good march across the enterprise to give you a sense of where we think customer backlogs are.\nPhilip Ng : Any color on the new projects you've talked about that got pushed out maybe?\nHoward Nye: Yes, the large energy projects, it's going to be interesting to see because, obviously, we're seeing energy pricing come back in ways this year that we anticipated that they would. I think part of what we had anticipated is until we started seeing that we were likely to see a slowdown on those jobs. We think we're likely to see those take off more in 2022. We had picked up very recently some volume on one of those projects in South Texas. So again, I think there are no big surprises, and there's nothing markedly different there than we spoke of as we really ramped up the year last year. Although it does look near term modestly brighter on some of the commitments that have been made over the last few weeks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Maybe if you could just comment on -- within the quarter -- I think you gave for the full year, what, your infrastructure and resi was up. Infrastructure, I guess, you mentioned North Carolina being down, but can you just comment what it was in the fourth quarter by end market? And then in light of the comments that you would expect more typical seasonality for the first half versus second half next year. Can you just help us think about if there's going to be any difference between how you would envision those end markets returning to growth next year, if it shall be starting in the first quarter? Or some of those will be more back half loaded?\nHoward Nye: Courtney, number one, welcome. We're delighted to have you here in this group and nice to have your question, too. If I think about end uses, here's the way I would think about it. I'd rather just talk about from a full-year perspective, Courtney, because I think that's probably a more directionally appropriate way to look at, at least from my seat in the bus. Infrastructure ended up last year to about 36% for us. Non-res was tight for infrastructure at 36%, and residential was at 24%. So that gives you a pretty good snapshot of what volumes look like for the year. What I would tell you is, I think 36% for infrastructure is awfully low. That said, an end-use that ought to be in the low to mid-40s. I certainly believe with what we're starting to see from our leading states right now -- and again, we've not built in a long-term highway bill into anything that we're talking about relative to '21. But if our states continue investing the way that they are and we see a long-term bill come through from the federal government, we think that 36% moves up toward the 40% number and maybe even ahead of that, that would feel more logical to us.  If we look at non-res at 36%, that's an odd one to me, and I'll tell you why. Historically, if we look at non-res, it would have been very consistent at about 30% of our volume. And that would have historically been a pretty clear defining break with non-res light being about half of that and non-res heavy being about half of that overall 30%. Year just ended, it was 36%. But here's what's happened. Clearly, the light portion of non-res has gone up. The heavy portion of non-res has gone up. But the irony is that heavy portion of non-res is really heavy right now. So what we're seeing is in data warehousing and the other delivery products that we're having, the sheer aggregates intensity of heavy non-res is richer than we've ever seen before. That is actually serving to fill, in large measure, the tonnage hole that would otherwise be left when we look at what's happened to hospitality, retail, et cetera. So that gives you a sense of where that is.  Now residential last year at 24% is a relatively high number. That's probably the highest single res number that we've ever seen. To give you a sense of what it looked like, at absolute May here, it\u2019s about 7%. Now what's happening is we're seeing res at 24% of our volume, but we're not seeing residential starts at a particularly high level, at least relative to a 50-year snapshot of it. What I think is most telling is back to the portion of the dialogue that we had before relative to what's happening with single-family residential within the overall residential snapshot.  In the recovery that ended with COVID's arrival, single-family housing was about 67% of overall housing activity. If we look at, what, 20, 30-year averages, it tends to be closer to 80%. That's what we're starting to see today. So again, as we think about what end uses look like on a percentage basis for '20 and the way that we think they're trending for '21, again, infrastructure, 36% in '20; non-res, 36%; res, 24%. As we move into '21, should we see infrastructure move up? I think we probably should. Will we see non-res move around a little bit, but probably not huge numbers? Probably so. Do we think res will be pretty consistent? The answer is yes. I also think it's worth noting that the railroads have said that they intend to be back to relatively normal levels of maintenance and repair as we come into the year. That's important because the ChemRock and Rail portion of our business, which covers not only the rail portion but what we sell to farmers as agricultural line in the Midwestern United States can be 8%, 9%, 10% portion of our business. As agricultural prices have continued to get better, our outlook for ag line, I think, will continue to improve. So Courtney, I threw a lot of data at you for the first time on the call. I apologize for that, but I hope that was helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. \nGarik Shmois : Ward, given your optimism in new infrastructure spending going through in the middle of the year, some of the large growth figures associated with it, how should we think about the timing around the new funding showing up in your volumes? Is it unrealistic to think that it could be a 2022 driver or is it more 2023? And can you speak to the DOTs\u2019 maybe ability to handle such a potential step-up in funding? Is there enough capacity to handle increase in revenue? It's a good problem to have, just kind of wondering how quickly you can see this benefit you?\nHoward Nye: No, I agree, Garik. I think those are great questions. So I would say several things. One, I do think most DOTs today have utilized their engineering and planning and eminent domain resources over the last several years to have themselves in a position that they're better placed than I would say at any time in my career to be able to take these funds and move with them. And I think part of that is going to be underscored by what they're going to be doing with the COVID relief dollars they've got as well. I mean to give you a sense of it, if we look at the COVID relief dollars all by themselves, out of the $10 billion, we're looking at $900 million, million to Texas; $134 million to Colorado; $260 million to North Carolina; Georgia is getting $323 million; Florida is getting $473 million; Iowa, $123 million; Indiana, $238 million; South Carolina, $167 million; Maryland, $150 million; and Nebraska, $72 million. So those are nice, big numbers going to those states.  So if we look at what they're going to be able to do with that in '21, we think they're going to be able to put most of that to work. To the extent that we see a highway bill that is in some form of pass by the time we get, let's call it, toward half year, we believe you start seeing some degree of pull-through in that in '22. But we equally believe what you're going to see is a nice built from that in '22. And we believe that's going to give at least the single biggest, most consistent in use that we have a nice multi-year run.  What I think can happen, Garik, is this notion of having perhaps infrastructure funding at levels that we haven't seen ever before and the nicest increase that we've seen in 15 years, together with what we feel like in our footprint is going to be a continued expansion in single-family housing and then also following these corridors of commerce that we've so intentionally built our business around, we think it does set the industry generally up but we think it set Martin Marietta specifically up for what could be a very nice multi-year volume trend. So Garik, I hope that was helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer : Hey, Ward, when you think about M&A, how open would you be to buying a vertically integrated company versus pure-play aggregates?\nHoward Nye: Adam, good morning, it's good to hear your voice. I guess what I would say, Adam, is it all depends on the player. We're specifically driven by markets, what we think are attractive markets, the position that we would have in that market and what we think we can do with the business. So here's the way I would encourage you to think about that. When we swapped out of the River business, when we swapped out of a pure stone business and we swapped into a vertically integrated marketplace, we didn't do that on that day because we lost any conviction in aggregates. This is an aggregates-led company. So what you should always expect us to do, wherever we're looking at M&A is for it to be aggregates-led. That's the important thing to remember. But what I think you and I recognize is there are some markets in the United States that do tend to be vertically integrated. And if you want to be in an attractive market that's vertically integrated, you better be in a position that you have competencies around stone, and at times, ready-mix, and at times, hot mix asphalt.  So would we consider it? Of course, we would consider it. But are we going to be very picky about the market? We will. And I think what you've seen from our track record is when we go and do that, what we've been able to do is add considerable shareholder value in the process.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Roger from Exane BNP Paribas. \nPaul Roger : I think most of the questions have been asked. I've just a follow-up on the downstream side of the business. I think if we look historically, downstream pricing and margins tend to be a bit more volatile than cement and aggregates. And historically, I've struggled a little bit if hydrocarbon costs are going up. Looking at your range and the middle of the guidance, it looks like you're expecting sort of flat margins this year. And I just wonder if you can comment on what gives you confidence that, that will be achievable in, particularly in ready-mix?\nHoward Nye: Paul, thank you very much for the questions. It's good to hear your voice, and hope you're well in the UK. Paul, I think if we look at where our downstream businesses are, that's what gives us the confidence in those. Keep in mind, we have downstream businesses in Colorado where we have ready-mix and we have asphalt, and we have downstream in Texas where we have ready-mix only. And I think what we're seeing is, particularly in Texas, a good amount of bidding not only on private work that's tied into residential but also in public work on some large projects. So as we look at what we believe is happening in that marketplace, even despite what can be some of the raw materials cost particularly on the energy side, I think we feel like that we can maintain those. Equally, if we look at our business in Colorado, that's really one of the better ready-mix markets in the United States. We see actually a pretty significant delta in ready-mix pricing in Colorado versus what we see in ready-mix pricing in most of Texas. And again, the hot mix asphalt and paving business that we have in Colorado, I think, is really one of the better hot mix asphalt and pavement businesses in the United States. It's got very high barriers to entry in that marketplace. And part of what we're seeing in that marketplace, too, although we're not experiencing it, but others are, Paul. There are some depletion scenarios on stone that are underway in portions of the front range. Martin Marietta is not affected by that.  We've got nice long-term reserve positions. But what we've done in that marketplace to, one, have good long-term reserve positions; but number two, make sure we have a nicely spread out distribution system is what's going to allow us to maintain margins in those downstream businesses. At the same time, part of what you'll see, if you look at the downstream businesses, is the raw materials piece of it does appear to be going up. And in large measure, that's because we're selling ourselves some raw materials in those businesses. And we recognize that the value of aggregates is very valuable, and it's getting more valuable each year. And we're going to make sure that even when we're doing those internally, we're doing it in a very equitable fashion because we want to treat our internal customers and our external customers exactly the same way, Paul. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. \nStanley Elliott : A question for you. With the change in administration, do you guys see anything working through the committees on the regulatory environment that would either add cost to the process, maybe slowdown in the construction markets at all? And then kind of a more broad thought, with the discussions around a $15 minimum wage, not really for you all, but for the customer contractor, what sort of disruptions that might cause, if any?\nHoward Nye: Yes. Great question, Stanley. The fact is we haven't seen anything coming through right now that we feel like it's going to be widely disruptive to what we're doing. I do think we're going to see considerably more ESG factors built into maybe not one big bill. I think you're going to see it built into most bills that come through. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. If you think of it from this perspective. One, a lot of it's going to be geared towards safety activities. You can see what our numbers are. We do that extraordinarily well. The other thing that I would tell you, you can go and look at the sustainability report that we put out, what you'll find out is that to the extent that we have greenhouse gases, we have 400 operations across the United States. Really, only 4 of them have any degree of notable GHG issues and that means 84% of our GHG issues come from 4 locations, which tell us that we've already set out really robust targets between now and 2030 on how we intend to deal with those, and we publish those annually.  So as we're sitting here and looking at what we feel like could be a higher regulatory market, we don't feel like we're seeing things right now that will be negatively impacting our business. Do I think it might make barriers to entry more difficult in our business, in the back? It may. Is that something to lament? I'll leave that to you. If you've got 90 years of reserves at current extraction rates, I'm not sure that's something that we're particularly concerned about today. The other thing that I will say is, to the extent that it increases costs, the simple fact is we can usually deal with that on the commercial side because we would typically see pricing going up. And the other thing that I would say is at least right now, our customer base is not complaining about a lack of available employees. What you remember, Stanley, is a couple of years ago, there was a trucking shortage. There was a labor shortage. Right now, we're not seeing that in our space. So logistics are working relatively well, and contractors are in a position that they can do what they need to with their projects day in and day out. So hopefully, that tick off the items that you listed, Stanley?\nStanley Elliott : You sure did. And you guys really do have a nice safety record. So congrats on that and best of luck the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Seth from Truist Securities.\nRohit Seth : Just getting on something you mentioned in the last question. Back in 2018, we had a pretty sharp spike in inflation in the second quarter. And the fiscal stimulus that we have out there today, there could be some supply tightness out there. I'm just curious, how do you plan on defending your margins should that reoccur in the second quarter this year?\nHoward Nye: Well, Rohit, it's good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. If you go across our footprint and you look at what cost of goods sold look like for us, the primary thing that you're going to see is the single biggest cost of goods sold that we have is labor. It's our employees. Then you're going to find a series of others that tend to be in the aggregates business around 12% to 15% of our COGS. That will be things like supplies, other inventories, what's happening with respect to maintenance and repair, et cetera. So if we go back over time and look at what we have done relative to our employee base, the way that we pay them, the tenure that they have, we don't see an inflation situation relative to wages that is anything that we're concerned about.  With respect to maintenance and repair, what you'll see as well is if you go over let's call it the SOAR years, you'll find that we've been very consistent with the way that we deployed capital in our business. What you'll see from that is the continuing thoughtful management of maintenance and repair.  Now one thing that you will see that went up a bit last year is some degrees of DD&A. And DD&A was up in large measure due to what we have done to invest responsibly in the business. So the one item -- and I'll ask Jim to speak to it very specifically, that we think could be a bit of a headwind this year is relative to energy and more specifically with respect to diesel fuel. Because clearly, we've seen that move around a little bit. Diesel fuel was a fairly notable tailwind for our company and for our industry all during 2020 that persisted into Q4. So I'll ask Jim to speak to that.  The other thing I'll ask Jim to speak to is what we saw relative to the sale of some excess properties last year that will likely not repeat. So I think from a inflation perspective, that's going to talk you about energy, but I also want you modeling to be thinking about what we're not going to do or at least replicate relative to land sales.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. Sure. So we've got currently forecasted a headwind of $30 million for higher diesel in 2021. WTI is, I think, $58 per barrel, I think I saw this morning. That's the average price that was out there in 2019. So effectively, we're going back to that level of diesel pricing as far as we can tell. So that's already in the forecast. And frankly, that we're holding on to our margins from 2020 and slightly building on those. So we're content in that environment to maintain margins and then offset diesel pricing.  As it relates to the land sale gains that Ward referred to, we had those very large gains in 2020, $70 million worth of gains. Those were hard thought and very much enjoyed, but they are not going to be repeating this year. So as you model out your numbers, we just ask that you look at 2020 EBITDA as a core, maybe pull up as land sale gains and not build on those as repeating into 2021.\nRohit Seth : Understood. And then on transportation costs, I'm seeing trucking costs going up a bit. What are you thinking there? Is that just a nominal grower? Or are you seeing any above normal growth there?\nHoward Nye: No. Look, I think we'll just see some fairly typical growth in transportation. We're not particularly troubled by that. And keep in mind, most of the transportation, particularly on the quarry side, we're selling stone to quarry. So we're counting on the customers to make transportation arrangements. And typically, when they pick up the stone, risk of loss leaves us as it goes up the scales.\nRohit Seth : Understood. So in 2Q '18, it was really just about -- it was diesel and transportation, but there's nothing else to really think about.\nHoward Nye: I think that's entirely correct, Rohit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Wilson from Raymond James. \nJosh Wilson : Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to make extra sure I understood the Cement margin commentary. I understand the year-on-year comparability issues with the outage. But it looks like the margin actually declines between the low and the high end of your guidance. Can you elaborate on maybe if there's some costs you would bring back at businesses at the high end of your expectations?\nHoward Nye: Let me ask Jim to respond to that. But yes, go ahead, Jim.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. From a cost perspective, natural gas is one of our inputs for fuel. That was pretty benign in 2020. We're forecasting that cost to go up slightly in 2021, and that's where you're seeing the margin slightly degrade year-over-year. Does that answer your question?\nJosh Wilson : I was talking about the high and the low end of the '21 guidance.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. Well, the natural gas -- I talk about revenues or margins?\nJosh Wilson : Margins.\nJim Nickolas: Margins. Yes. So natural gas is an input for our Cement business to fire the kiln, and we're forecasting those costs to go up.\nHoward Nye: So what's going to happen as a practical matter, Josh. If we look at energy overall for the aggregates business, it's going to tend to be about 12%. And of that, diesel fuel is going to be about 8% of that. When we look at energy overall for the Cement business, it's a much larger percentage of the overall cost of goods sold for Cement. And it's tending to be in the 20% range for overall energy. So I think that probably helps bridge that a bit for you.\nJosh Wilson : And if I could just sneak in one other. Your CapEx guidance is about the same as you initially started in 2020. Is that a good long-term number as well as we think about the cash potential as we get into an infrastructure bill?\nJim Nickolas: I think it is. We had started out there last year, as you pointed out. And then COVID brought in the level of uncertainty, and we pulled back quite a bit on CapEx 2020. We restored it in 2021. I think 9% -- 8% to 10% of sales is a rough proxy of where our CapEx sits. So you can kind of scale as the business grows, our CapEx will grow accordingly. So $450 million is probably not a bad number to be at. It's a little bit higher than we've been at recently. But again, we brought it down in 2020. So it\u2019s quite not a bad number to be at going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. \nTimna Tanners : I'm sure you'll talk about this also at your upcoming Investor Day. But the big thing that sticks out to me in looking at your high-quality problem of these very strong cash flows is what you're going to do with them going forward. So I just wondered if you could just remind us of your priorities. It sounds like you're excited about M&A. You do have a little more CapEx you just talked about. But what does it take for the Board to consider more buybacks or increased dividend? If you could just remind us about that?\nHoward Nye: Happy to, Timna. So thank you so much for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Our capital priorities haven't changed, and that is the -- we feel like the best first on our spend is on the right transaction. And several years ago, I remember, we were coming into a year and we said that we thought it could be a year of some notable transactions for the industry. I think the prospect is this could be a year of some notable transactions. We've tried to have ourselves financially and regulatorily in a position that if large transactions or notable transactions or attractive ones came along, we would be in a place that we could play. So if we think about our best first dollar spent, that's it.  Next, we're looking at assuring that we're investing responsively in the business. And if you look at what we've been able to do through cycles relative to CapEx, and as Jim was just indicating, we think we have treated the business really quite well. And if we look at what that has allowed us to do relative to our cost performance, we think that we have been largely outperforming. And then third, to your point, and your very good question is, a return of cash to shareholders. And we've done that through two very different ways, Timna. Number one, we've had a meaningful and a sustainable dividend. And we think both of those words are really important.  So one thing to keep in mind, I believe we're the only heavy side building materials company who can say this, we've never cut a dividend. So the fact is, we've been able to maintain a dividend all the way through cycles. And what's important is this company, even in August, when the world was faced with all the uncertainties from COVID-19, we raised our dividend by 4%. And if you go back and look at where we were the year before that or the year before that, you'll find even bigger increases. So clearly, our Board is going to come back and look at the dividend in August.  As you\u2019ll recall as well, when we bought TXI, we issued 20 million shares of stock to combine the companies together. Shortly after that, our Board took the view, okay, our shareholders were good enough to give us license to go and do this with a very high percentage shareholder vote. We're going to make sure over time, opportunistically, we come back and take that dilution back. And we've been on that journey. We've got about 15 million shares left in that authorization. We want to continue chipping away on that. But the conversations we've had with our shareholders have tended to be, if you have the ability to do the right deal, that's where we want you to be. And these are conversations that we're always very frontal with our shareholders because they're our owners at the end of the day. And we want to make sure that we're meeting their needs and their expectations. But that's the priorities. That's how we're looking at it, Timna. So again, I hope that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta from JPMorgan.\nAdrian Huerta : Yes. Most of my questions were answered, but just very quickly on -- if you can comment a little bit on how the first quarter is looking. I mean, usually, we see volumes down sequentially 10% to 15% in the first quarter. Yes -- but we are ending with a very strong volume in the fourth quarter. Given what you have seen so far with whether it's an activity, et cetera, can we expect at least the same guidance that we have seen in the past?\nHoward Nye: Adrian, I really appreciate the question, and it's a good one because here's the dichotomy that we find ourselves in. Last year when most companies were withdrawing guidance, they were certainly encouraged to be forward-leaning and be even more forthcoming into what they might see in the coming months. Part of what we're so pleased with is we feel like we're back in a more normalized state, trending to an even more normalized state, and because of that, we've reinstituted guidance. And our practice has always been, if we had guidance in place to make sure that we were really sticking very close within the four-walls of the quarter in which we're addressing. So I'll talk a little bit -- well, I'll talk a lot more about January when we're together and we're reporting the full -- the quarter results. I'll say this much, part of what we thought was important, was ending the year with momentum, and we thought that we would see it carry into the year. So we'll talk more about the first quarter when we come up with results. But I wanted to give you a sense of why, unlike at least the last two calls, we're not rushing to talk about the month that we're in right now.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas : So Ward, just quickly, you mentioned about the $10 billion in the allocations there in certain states on the relief funds, the DOTs. And some pretty good numbers for some of the states that are not in your top five. What are the 2 or 3 area or states you look at going and you look at the plan of 2020 that could be generating positive surprises from you generally in the business and maybe more so if some of that funding were to flow more aggressively into those states on the infrastructure side?\nHoward Nye: Look, thank you very much for the question. I think 2 states that we'll particularly watch and they were important states to us last year. And candidly, they don't get depressed, but they should. Indiana had a fantastic year last year. The management team that we have there just ran that business like a Swiss watch last year. And Indiana is getting $238 million more, and they've got a very good highway program there. The other business that performed extraordinarily well last year, and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, is the business that we have in Maryland in the aftermath of the Bluegrass transaction. Again, Maryland got $150 million coming into that marketplace as well.  So we've talked about how important Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida are, those are 1 through 5. But again, if we see the type of performance, I think we can expect to see in Indiana and what we might see in Maryland, those could be some very nice surprises coming into 2021. I'm not even sure we'd say surprises, but I think that could give some potential nice upside. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman : Ward, just a question on the North Carolina public sector, in particular, just because the deficit in whole and lettings last year was so significant, do you feel like you've already felt the brunt of that in the business? Are you anticipating the spillover effect from that, recognizing that obviously, it's in recovery and lettings have forecast to pick up this year? Just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the spillover into '21?\nHoward Nye: No, I think that's a great question, Brent. I would say several things. One, we went into '20 with some of the best backlogs we've ever had in North Carolina. And so that allowed us to weather a pretty challenging time in our State. Now I'm probably going to jinx this right now, so I shouldn't say this, but right now, we've had no harsh winter weather in North Carolina either, which means let's face it. At the end of the day, we really don't want to see DOT having to move snow off roads in North Carolina. So I think it's a practical matter of seeing resurfacing projects go, seeing the $700 million from billed NC bonds and utilizing that and a much healthier bidding circumstance on top of the backlogs that we have, make weathering what we've already done much better. And I think it does outline a much brighter 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond in North Carolina.  So we feel like we have been through the toughest period by far. And that we're going to see the State begin to perform much more in line with what our historical expectations would have been. So Brent, I hope that helps.\nHoward Nye: Well, thank you all for joining our earnings conference call today. Built on our solid foundation of past successes, we're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to drive continued sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2021 and beyond. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2021 results in a few months, and importantly, sharing our strategic priorities with you at our coming Investor Day on February 25. Registration details for this virtual event will be available soon. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time, for your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay well. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Howard Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy. By all accounts, 2020 was extraordinary for Martin Marietta, we're proud to have extended our long track record of financial, operational and safety excellence, particularly in a year filled with unprecedented disruption.  Martin Marietta set new performance records, delivering almost profitable year and the best safety performance in our company's history. These impressive results demonstrate our resilient business model and our team's commitment to Martin Marietta's vision and successful execution of our proven Strategic Operating Analysis and Review or SOAR plan.  As noted, today's discussion focuses on our full year results and 2021 outlook. Before doing so, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record setting fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved solid shipment and pricing growth across all product lines as construction activity stabilized from the spring and summer months when we saw a greater impact from COVID-19. These top-line improvements, along with our steadfast focus on cost controls, resulted in 7% growth in consolidated total revenues, 20% growth in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA and a 40% increase in diluted earnings per share.  For the full year, we established new records for products and services revenues, profitability and adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, full year consolidated products and services revenues increased to $4.4 billion, consolidated gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to nearly $1.4 billion and diluted earnings per share was $11.54, an 18% improvement.  Martin Marietta's 2020 results marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. Operating our business safely sets the foundation for our longstanding financial success. Martin Marietta's industry-leading safety performance continues to trend near or exceed world class safety levels. We achieved a 25% reduction in total reportable incidents across the enterprise in 2020. And for the fourth consecutive year, we achieved a company-wide world class lost time incident rate. These superior financial and safety results are directly attributable to the dedication and agility of our nearly 9,000 talented employees. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team managed the challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic while remaining focused on being good wingmen, working safely and efficiently together and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders' needs.  With that overview, let's now turn to our full year operating performance. Aggregate shipments declined 2% to nearly 187 million tons, reflecting anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina, reduced energy sector demand and headwinds from COVID-19 disruptions. However, in line with broader macroeconomic trends, full year aggregate shipments to the residential market increased, benefiting from healthy single-family housing activity. Aggregates' average selling price increased 4% on a mix adjusted basis, in line with our expectations. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, a testament to this product line's resilient pricing power and our leading market positions in attractive geographies.  The disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy, along with attractive underlying market fundamentals will continue to support sustainable pricing growth moving forward. Our cement operations established new records for shipments, which increased 2% to nearly 4 million tons. Large project activity supported underlying product demand in both North and South Texas throughout the year, offsetting weakness in the energy sector. Pricing increased 3% on a mix adjusted basis, demonstrating the resilient price fundamentals of core products in the State of Texas. We expect our cement business will continue to benefit from favorable shipment and pricing trends, supported by tight supply and healthy demand in Texas, diversified customer backlogs and April 2021 price increases. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3%, excluding shipments from acquired operations and from our Southwest division's former concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas, which we divested in January 2020. Concrete pricing increased 2%. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business established a new record for asphalt shipments, increasing 15% to 3 million tons. This growth reflected solid underlying product demand together with carryover work following a weather challenged 2019. Asphalt pricing increased nearly 3%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full year financial results and liquidity. Jim? Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead, we believe 2021 will be a year in which we see a return to a more normalized state as underlying demand fundamentals reset and the nation's economy regains momentum. We remain confident in Martin Marietta's attractive business drivers and are encouraged by accelerating long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end-use markets and key geographies. We expect these trends to drive construction-led aggregates-intensive growth. Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways, roads and streets, continues to prove resilient. With the 1-year extension of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act at current funding levels, state and local governments have the visibility needed to plan, design and award transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Importantly, estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top 5 Departments of Transportation, or DOTs, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top 5 states: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to us, representing 71% of our 2020 Building Materials business total revenues. Additionally, DOTs were recently granted nearly $10 billion of targeted relief as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Act passed in December 2020 to help offset pandemic-driven transportation revenue shortfalls. This funding assistance has the benefit of no state matching requirements. Based on preliminary estimates, over $2 billion of this assistance will be apportioned to Martin Marietta's top 5 states. Over the medium to long-term, we anticipate voter-approved state and local transportation measures and passage of a comprehensive federal transportation program package to promote multi-year growth in product demand. In November 2020, voters sent a powerful message of support for state and local transportation investment approving 94% of ballot measures, the highest ever approval rating. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $14 billion in one-time and recurring transportation funding, of which 82% is in Texas, our top revenue-generating state. Bipartisan support exists for new surface transportation legislation aimed at increasing funding levels not seen in over 15 years, with both the United States House of Representatives and Senate previously advancing proposed bills. We believe this 117th Congress creates a path toward advancing a notable increase in funding over the FAST Act. We're optimistic that agreement on a new bill could be reached this summer, generating meaningful benefits in 2022 and beyond. We expect increased infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregate shipments in that end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 43% of our total shipments. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of 2020 shipments. Non-residential construction should continue to benefit from accelerating e-commerce and remote work trends that require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, particularly in our key metros of Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, Denver, Des Moines, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Atlanta. Importantly, this type of construction tends to be more aggregates-intensive than light commercial construction due to the size, scale and structure of these projects. Light commercial and retail construction will remain comparatively challenged until COVID-19 vaccines are more widely distributed. Over the longer term, light non-residential activity will benefit from the attractive collateral effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 34% of 2020 shipments. Single-family housing is poised for multi-year growth returning to more normalized levels during this economic cycle. We believe Martin Marietta's leading Southeastern and Southwestern footprint positions the company to be a notable beneficiary of these trends given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Single-family housing is 2 times to 3 times more aggregates-intensive than multi-family construction, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of 2020 shipments. In summary, we're confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business. As disclosed in today's release, we've returned to providing full year annual guidance. We currently expect 2021 aggregate shipment growth to range from up 1% to up 4%, reflecting single-family housing strength, expanded infrastructure investment and heavy industrial projects of scale that will support our near-term shipment levels. We remain confident that our favorable pricing trends are sustainable, supported by improved contractor confidence and healthy customer backlogs. For 2021, we expect annual aggregates price increases, which become effective from January 1 to April 1, to increase in a range of up 3% to up 5%. Combined with contributions from our Cement, Downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, on a consolidated basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1,350 million to $1,450 million. Keep in mind, when comparing this guidance range to prior year, we're not anticipating the same level of non-recurring gains from land sales and divested surplus assets as seen in 2020. To conclude, we're proud of our 2020 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We're also extremely optimistic about our future. Martin Marietta has a strong foundation, thanks to our solid balance sheet and the investments we've made in our assets, people and capabilities. Due to our work over the last several years, Martin Marietta is uniquely well positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long-term. Importantly, the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, coupled with our pricing discipline, operational excellence, prudent capital allocation and adherence to robust health protocols will continue to enhance Martin Marietta's solid foundation for enduring success. As we move forward, we have the resources, team and capabilities to drive value-enhancing growth. We're confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, operational and safety performance and remain focused on delivering superior returns for investors while meeting and exceeding our commitments to our other stakeholders, including our customers, employees and communities. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. Well, Happy New Year to you, Kathryn, that's a mouthful. We'll walk through it. And let's talk about cement and pricing first. Number one, to see the cement price performance in Texas this year was actually affirming. If we go back over time and remember how we spoke about cement when we acquired it with TXI, we indicated we believe Texas cement pricing would start to act like aggregate pricing. That's exactly what we saw in this quarter. What I think is doubly important about that and impressive, keep in mind, for much of the year, we were not in a position to go and see our customers. So to see that type of performance on a mix adjusted basis is actually quite impressive. Keep in mind too, although you don't see it in the numbers, if we're looking at type 1 and type 2 cement, that was actually selling for closer to 4% up as opposed to 3% up. So if we're really looking at the bread-and-butter products, it looks really quite impressive.  If we look at overall cement dynamics in the State, Texas is a nice place to be in any heavy side building materials business. Because particularly for cement right now, demand outstrips supply, and that's always a good place to start. We think that's particularly going to be the case as we go through the year in North Texas this year. So again, that feeds directly into our operations in Midlothian. Equally, the marketplace that we're seeing around Hunter is actually quite attractive as well.  What we see from a volume perspective has been driven by a series of things. One, by some big jobs. So in the North, we're seeing Loop 12. We're seeing I-635, which is also known as the LBJ. If you go down toward South Texas, what's going on relative to the Grand Parkway has been nicely generative or utilizing cement and ready-mix and aggregates and all the way through. So we think the outlook is frankly as good as we just saw in Q4. If you're looking really more to what potential air pockets could be, I'll tell you very candidly, in Texas, we don't see it, Kathryn. A couple of things lead me to believe that. One, the FY '21 lettings in Texas are actually 25% over where they were last year. In other words, we're looking for about $9.5 billion worth of lettings. The other 2 pieces to keep in mind is the 2021 revenue streams that we're seeing either coming through Prop 7 and Prop 1 in Texas are really quite healthy. So we're looking at transfers of about $2.5 billion this year relative to Prop 7 and about $1.2 billion relative to Prop 1.  Something else that's worth keeping in mind, too, is when we were looking at the COVID relief that's called into different DOTs, Texas was the recipient of almost $914 million. Again, we spoke to the fact that those have not come encumbered with any particular state match. So for a state that already found itself in a very good position to have that extra money come in as well gives us a sense that we're in a very, very good place.  As an ultimate reminder, Texas has rained a fund of $10.5 billion that they have not tapped. So as we're looking at Texas, both near term, medium-term and long-term, we like very much what we see. So I hope that's responsive to your series of questions, Kathryn. No, happy to, David. Thank you very much for your questions. We'll start with respect to pricing. So as we think about pricing in the Texas marketplace today, what we're seeing are price increases out there that have been put out. We put out a $9 a ton price increase effective in April. We've seen others that customers have shown us that have been closer to $6. So I think that gives you at least some base to think about relative to pricing for the year. I think equally, as we look at the likelihood of price increases hitting in different percentages, clearly, North Texas is going to look stronger than South Texas is. Central is going to be just fine. I think to your point, if it's going to be tight anywhere this year on cement tonnage, it's likely more in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, meaning Midlothian. And so we'll just have to watch that as the year goes on.  One thing I would ask you to do is, and that is you asked a very good question around capacity in Texas, because you're going back to the notion that right now demand is outstripping supply. As you know, we have an Analyst and Investor Day that's coming up later this month. We're going to talk about some of the very specific capital initiatives that we have underway. And I would ask you to wait and listen to what we have to say about that particular process when we're talking to you live later in the month relative to our cement outlook and our aggregates outlook in Texas. With respect to some of the other numbers that you mentioned, you're entirely right relative to rhythm and cadence around kiln maintenance. We did have a relatively lower number of kiln maintenance in 2020. If we're looking at the overall kiln maintenance spend in 2020, it was about $19.7 million. As we're looking to see what it's going to be into the new year, we are looking at a number that's going to be somewhat higher than that. We're looking more at about a $22.7 million number for total kiln maintenance in '21. And so we're looking at some of those puts and takes. But I think that gives you a sense of do we have capacity issues that we need to think about longer and medium term? Yes, we do. Are we in a circumstance that pricing is doing what we thought it would? It absolutely is. Are the dollars that we've put into the kilns having them run at a higher rate of efficiency? There's no doubt that they are.  So if we're looking at kiln reliability, as Jim commented in his commentary, they ran at 90% kiln reliability in the year just ended. The year before, it's at 82%. So we like very much the way that business is going operationally, the way that business is going commercially and what we feel like its future is. So David, I hope that was responsive to your question. No, happy to, Trey. Thank you very much. As you indicated, we've walked through what some of the numbers look like in Texas. As Jim indicated in his prepared remarks, if we look at Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, those states comprise around 71% of our revenue. So those states are going well, a lot of things good happens for Martin Marietta. As I indicated, I won't go back through all the details that we hit, but we're looking at Texas lettings up 25%. Let's go through the others and I think that will give you a sense of why we've got the degree of confidence that we do. Colorado, which, as you know, in '20 had just a spectacular year. I mean, you heard us reference the fact that our asphalt and paving business in that State had a record year. We're looking at a DOT program in Colorado that we believe is going to be flat year-over-year. And what I'm about to tell you is when we're looking at our top 5 states, yet the worst that we're seeing anywhere is flat, that's not a bad place to be coming off of a record year. So if we're looking at the $10 billion COVID stimulus, about $134 million of those dollars is finding its way to Colorado, which we believe is to bring their DOT program up about even with where it was last year. Now by contrast, our home State, North Carolina, did not have a particularly good year last year. We think North Carolina DOT is in a far better position. And as you know, if we look at this State, historically, it has not only been one of our most profitable. It's been one of our most consistent as well. So we think North Carolina is trending back into an area that makes much more sense for us. To give you a sense of what that means, the FY '21 lettings projection is about $1.3 billion. That's $670 million better than I think people would have expected when they were looking at it last year. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is North Carolina did issue $700 million of build in C bonds. So again, as we're looking at the near-term future of North Carolina, we're really very pleased with that. One thing I will mention as well, the NC First Commission, which I was a part of here in North Carolina, looked at really how North Carolina needs to think about its investment in infrastructure over the next 10 years. And our view was they needed to put at least $20 billion more in infrastructure in the State. So the State is looking at ways to do that. But that's clearly longer term than just this year. If we go to Georgia, again, we think Georgia is relatively flat year-over-year. But if you look at where that State has been sequentially, if we go back to 2016, you'll see a budget that's gone from about $1.7 billion to one that's about $2.1 billion. And then the other thing to keep in mind is Georgia still has ahead of it the major mobility investment program. And the overall goal of that is to have a number of very large projects, about $12 billion to be more specific, underway by 2025 and completed by 2030. And then, of course, the last, the top 5 states is Florida, they're looking at their spending to increase about 20% year-over-year. So again, if we look at the top 5, Texas is better, North Carolina is better. Florida is better and Colorado and Georgia are broadly flat. So when we look at that type of trajectory on something that's around 71% of our revenues in those states, I think that's part of what gives us the confidence that, that we have and the volume outlook that we've offered today. As we look at it, and I think part of what you heard us say earlier, I mean, we're back to the point that we put in full guidance again. So I think that gives you a sense that we've all found a way to manage through this. And I think to that end, Anthony, what I would suggest is a normal rhythm and cadence is probably broadly the right way to think about this. I do think there's going to be a degree to which you'll see some of it that's going to be modestly more in the back half as opposed to the front half. Obviously, Q2 and particularly Q3 were the 2 quarters that were most impacted by COVID. By the time we got to Q4, in many respects, we had a lot of this figured out. And certainly, we had more favorable weather in Q4. So I would look broadly at a rather normal rhythm and cadence, slightly heavier toward half 2 as opposed to half 1. I hope that's helpful. That's a great question. Here's how I would catch in that. I think we've got a good sense of what public is going to look like, and we think public is going to look better. And I think we have a good sense of what residential is going to look like, and residential is going to look better. And residential is particularly going to look better with respect to single-family. We believe single-family as a percentage of overall housing will return to more normalized percentages. In other words, it's going to be about 80% of housing in the United States. And when we see single-family housing at 1 million starts or 1.1 million or 1.2 million, I will tell you, that's a pretty healthy place for our business. Because here's what happens. That's evidence of new neighborhoods being built. And so if you think about 2 cities that are important to us, think about Atlanta and think about Dallas, both tend to be North-South cities, both tend to be growing more North than South. So what that means is, years ago, you were growing North from Dallas to Plano, now you're growing from Dallas to Frisco and now you're going to be moving North from Frisco to North of Frisco.  As we see new communities come-in in Frisco or as they go into Alpharetta or other places North of Atlanta, new communities need the follow-on effect that you get in non-residential. Now history tells us, depending on geography, that can have a 6 to, let's call it, an 18-month lag behind it. If we're seeing single-family growth in communities and you've got a 6-month lag on that, that can start pushing you toward the higher end of our volume guidance. Because if we think about the different end uses, res infrastructure is going to be better. Residential is going to be better, particularly single-family.  As we land on non-res, as we said comparatively the toughest of the 3 end uses, the heavy side of that, we believe, is going to be good. With warehousing, data, et cetera, all of which are very aggregates-intensive. So some of the swing side to the upper end of that is going to be relative to the drag along effect of the light portion of non-res that we believe will follow continued single-family growth. So that was a mouthful. And I apologize if that was a mouthful, but I hope that was followable. Jerry, thanks for the question. What I would say is, if you look at what M&A has done for Martin Marietta through the SOAR years, and by that, I mean, from 2010 today, M&A has been our preferred methodology of growth. It has served us and our owners well. We think it will continue to serve us well. When we think about M&A, we think about it in a long-term strategic view. At the same time, we're not going to go into transactions that we know are not going to be near term attractive deals for us either. In fairness, typically, we're not going to take tax rates much into account in the way that we're looking at M&A. Because we feel like getting the right deal in the right market is the most important thing that we can do for our company near term and long-term. It allows our teams to grow. It allows our company to grow. It lets us grow into markets that we think will be attractive. And at the end of the day, where we believe we can have leading positions.  As you'll recall, we have a leading position in 90% of our markets today. 10 years ago, we had a leading position in 65% of our markets. We're going to be looking at M&A through 2 different lenses. We're going to be looking at it in bolt-on acquisitions in markets that we currently exist. But equally, we will look at potential platform acquisitions in markets in which we would like to grow. As a reminder and we've not been shy about this, we've long talked about the 2050 regional planning that shows what growth is going to look like in the United States between now and 2050. And the short answer is the country is going to add about 140 million people over that time period, and 70% of them will land in one of 11 mega regions. And so if you watch the mega regions and see what -- where they are and if you look at our footprint, the likelihood is we will continue to want to be focused in those mega regions, either with bolt-ons or with platforms.  Relative to our M&A pipeline and our team, they would like to sleep more. But the short answer is they're very busy people right now. They are very talented people. And we're very grateful for them. And our intention is to do all that we can to keep them tired and hungry. Nishu, number one, welcome back. It's good to hear your voice. Number two, with respect to your question, I'm sure that we would be naive not to assume that there was some that would have been pushed into Q4, simply because Q3 would have been more impacted and the weather was favorable. So I think that's certainly a possibility. What I think we saw more of though is the build of some momentum and saw nice momentum going into four. Experience tells me that contractors are finishing a year in which they don't have good confidence in the next year. Rather than hurry up, they tend to slow down because they want to make sure that they have plenty of work for their workforces as they come into a new year. So what I would say too is, I mean I think that's certainly possible, Nishu, but I equally think what we're seeing, particularly relative to single-family housing and what's tending to follow it and then the overall health of the DOTs in the states in which we are operating, I think those are coalescing to give nice momentum in 4 that we believe persists into '21. Phil, thanks so much for your question. What I would say is the customer backlogs are looking fairly similar in many respects to where they were last year. One thing that's worth remembering is the backlogs really, at this time of the year for customers, only represent about 20% to 35% of what people really think their shipment needs are going to be. But what I would say is overall aggregate tons are modestly up as we talk to our customers right now. If we look at cement tons, they're actually up double-digits right now. If we look at Magnesia Specialties, they're actually up double-digits as well. So I think part of what's important to remember, Phil, is we're going into '21, two parts of our business that have historically been very good, steady parts of our business, meaning North Carolina and Magnesia Specialties did not have the best years in '20 and are both looking at considerably better years coming into the year in '21.  So as we're looking at overall backlogs, they look really quite good for us. The only area that our backlogs are notably off would be in portions of Colorado. And what we're seeing in Colorado, and I think this goes back to your question, is actually right now a very good level of bidding activity in that State. So as we mentioned, we're coming off what was a record year last year in Colorado. And we anticipate it coming into '21, that would almost have to be modestly slower. As I indicated in some of the earlier questions, with some of the COVID money that is coming to Colorado, DOT numbers are broadly even, and now we're seeing much better bidding activity. So I guess what I have to say on that, Phil, is more to come. But I try to give you what we feel like is a good march across the enterprise to give you a sense of where we think customer backlogs are. Yes, the large energy projects, it's going to be interesting to see because, obviously, we're seeing energy pricing come back in ways this year that we anticipated that they would. I think part of what we had anticipated is until we started seeing that we were likely to see a slowdown on those jobs. We think we're likely to see those take off more in 2022. We had picked up very recently some volume on one of those projects in South Texas. So again, I think there are no big surprises, and there's nothing markedly different there than we spoke of as we really ramped up the year last year. Although it does look near term modestly brighter on some of the commitments that have been made over the last few weeks. Courtney, number one, welcome. We're delighted to have you here in this group and nice to have your question, too. If I think about end uses, here's the way I would think about it. I'd rather just talk about from a full-year perspective, Courtney, because I think that's probably a more directionally appropriate way to look at, at least from my seat in the bus. Infrastructure ended up last year to about 36% for us. Non-res was tight for infrastructure at 36%, and residential was at 24%. So that gives you a pretty good snapshot of what volumes look like for the year. What I would tell you is, I think 36% for infrastructure is awfully low. That said, an end-use that ought to be in the low to mid-40s. I certainly believe with what we're starting to see from our leading states right now -- and again, we've not built in a long-term highway bill into anything that we're talking about relative to '21. But if our states continue investing the way that they are and we see a long-term bill come through from the federal government, we think that 36% moves up toward the 40% number and maybe even ahead of that, that would feel more logical to us.  If we look at non-res at 36%, that's an odd one to me, and I'll tell you why. Historically, if we look at non-res, it would have been very consistent at about 30% of our volume. And that would have historically been a pretty clear defining break with non-res light being about half of that and non-res heavy being about half of that overall 30%. Year just ended, it was 36%. But here's what's happened. Clearly, the light portion of non-res has gone up. The heavy portion of non-res has gone up. But the irony is that heavy portion of non-res is really heavy right now. So what we're seeing is in data warehousing and the other delivery products that we're having, the sheer aggregates intensity of heavy non-res is richer than we've ever seen before. That is actually serving to fill, in large measure, the tonnage hole that would otherwise be left when we look at what's happened to hospitality, retail, et cetera. So that gives you a sense of where that is.  Now residential last year at 24% is a relatively high number. That's probably the highest single res number that we've ever seen. To give you a sense of what it looked like, at absolute May here, it's about 7%. Now what's happening is we're seeing res at 24% of our volume, but we're not seeing residential starts at a particularly high level, at least relative to a 50-year snapshot of it. What I think is most telling is back to the portion of the dialogue that we had before relative to what's happening with single-family residential within the overall residential snapshot.  In the recovery that ended with COVID's arrival, single-family housing was about 67% of overall housing activity. If we look at, what, 20, 30-year averages, it tends to be closer to 80%. That's what we're starting to see today. So again, as we think about what end uses look like on a percentage basis for '20 and the way that we think they're trending for '21, again, infrastructure, 36% in '20; non-res, 36%; res, 24%. As we move into '21, should we see infrastructure move up? I think we probably should. Will we see non-res move around a little bit, but probably not huge numbers? Probably so. Do we think res will be pretty consistent? The answer is yes. I also think it's worth noting that the railroads have said that they intend to be back to relatively normal levels of maintenance and repair as we come into the year. That's important because the ChemRock and Rail portion of our business, which covers not only the rail portion but what we sell to farmers as agricultural line in the Midwestern United States can be 8%, 9%, 10% portion of our business. As agricultural prices have continued to get better, our outlook for ag line, I think, will continue to improve. So Courtney, I threw a lot of data at you for the first time on the call. I apologize for that, but I hope that was helpful. No, I agree, Garik. I think those are great questions. So I would say several things. One, I do think most DOTs today have utilized their engineering and planning and eminent domain resources over the last several years to have themselves in a position that they're better placed than I would say at any time in my career to be able to take these funds and move with them. And I think part of that is going to be underscored by what they're going to be doing with the COVID relief dollars they've got as well. I mean to give you a sense of it, if we look at the COVID relief dollars all by themselves, out of the $10 billion, we're looking at $900 million, million to Texas; $134 million to Colorado; $260 million to North Carolina; Georgia is getting $323 million; Florida is getting $473 million; Iowa, $123 million; Indiana, $238 million; South Carolina, $167 million; Maryland, $150 million; and Nebraska, $72 million. So those are nice, big numbers going to those states.  So if we look at what they're going to be able to do with that in '21, we think they're going to be able to put most of that to work. To the extent that we see a highway bill that is in some form of pass by the time we get, let's call it, toward half year, we believe you start seeing some degree of pull-through in that in '22. But we equally believe what you're going to see is a nice built from that in '22. And we believe that's going to give at least the single biggest, most consistent in use that we have a nice multi-year run.  What I think can happen, Garik, is this notion of having perhaps infrastructure funding at levels that we haven't seen ever before and the nicest increase that we've seen in 15 years, together with what we feel like in our footprint is going to be a continued expansion in single-family housing and then also following these corridors of commerce that we've so intentionally built our business around, we think it does set the industry generally up but we think it set Martin Marietta specifically up for what could be a very nice multi-year volume trend. So Garik, I hope that was helpful. Adam, good morning, it's good to hear your voice. I guess what I would say, Adam, is it all depends on the player. We're specifically driven by markets, what we think are attractive markets, the position that we would have in that market and what we think we can do with the business. So here's the way I would encourage you to think about that. When we swapped out of the River business, when we swapped out of a pure stone business and we swapped into a vertically integrated marketplace, we didn't do that on that day because we lost any conviction in aggregates. This is an aggregates-led company. So what you should always expect us to do, wherever we're looking at M&A is for it to be aggregates-led. That's the important thing to remember. But what I think you and I recognize is there are some markets in the United States that do tend to be vertically integrated. And if you want to be in an attractive market that's vertically integrated, you better be in a position that you have competencies around stone, and at times, ready-mix, and at times, hot mix asphalt.  So would we consider it? Of course, we would consider it. But are we going to be very picky about the market? We will. And I think what you've seen from our track record is when we go and do that, what we've been able to do is add considerable shareholder value in the process. Paul, thank you very much for the questions. It's good to hear your voice, and hope you're well in the UK. Paul, I think if we look at where our downstream businesses are, that's what gives us the confidence in those. Keep in mind, we have downstream businesses in Colorado where we have ready-mix and we have asphalt, and we have downstream in Texas where we have ready-mix only. And I think what we're seeing is, particularly in Texas, a good amount of bidding not only on private work that's tied into residential but also in public work on some large projects. So as we look at what we believe is happening in that marketplace, even despite what can be some of the raw materials cost particularly on the energy side, I think we feel like that we can maintain those. Equally, if we look at our business in Colorado, that's really one of the better ready-mix markets in the United States. We see actually a pretty significant delta in ready-mix pricing in Colorado versus what we see in ready-mix pricing in most of Texas. And again, the hot mix asphalt and paving business that we have in Colorado, I think, is really one of the better hot mix asphalt and pavement businesses in the United States. It's got very high barriers to entry in that marketplace. And part of what we're seeing in that marketplace, too, although we're not experiencing it, but others are, Paul. There are some depletion scenarios on stone that are underway in portions of the front range. Martin Marietta is not affected by that.  We've got nice long-term reserve positions. But what we've done in that marketplace to, one, have good long-term reserve positions; but number two, make sure we have a nicely spread out distribution system is what's going to allow us to maintain margins in those downstream businesses. At the same time, part of what you'll see, if you look at the downstream businesses, is the raw materials piece of it does appear to be going up. And in large measure, that's because we're selling ourselves some raw materials in those businesses. And we recognize that the value of aggregates is very valuable, and it's getting more valuable each year. And we're going to make sure that even when we're doing those internally, we're doing it in a very equitable fashion because we want to treat our internal customers and our external customers exactly the same way, Paul. So hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. Great question, Stanley. The fact is we haven't seen anything coming through right now that we feel like it's going to be widely disruptive to what we're doing. I do think we're going to see considerably more ESG factors built into maybe not one big bill. I think you're going to see it built into most bills that come through. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. If you think of it from this perspective. One, a lot of it's going to be geared towards safety activities. You can see what our numbers are. We do that extraordinarily well. The other thing that I would tell you, you can go and look at the sustainability report that we put out, what you'll find out is that to the extent that we have greenhouse gases, we have 400 operations across the United States. Really, only 4 of them have any degree of notable GHG issues and that means 84% of our GHG issues come from 4 locations, which tell us that we've already set out really robust targets between now and 2030 on how we intend to deal with those, and we publish those annually.  So as we're sitting here and looking at what we feel like could be a higher regulatory market, we don't feel like we're seeing things right now that will be negatively impacting our business. Do I think it might make barriers to entry more difficult in our business, in the back? It may. Is that something to lament? I'll leave that to you. If you've got 90 years of reserves at current extraction rates, I'm not sure that's something that we're particularly concerned about today. The other thing that I will say is, to the extent that it increases costs, the simple fact is we can usually deal with that on the commercial side because we would typically see pricing going up. And the other thing that I would say is at least right now, our customer base is not complaining about a lack of available employees. What you remember, Stanley, is a couple of years ago, there was a trucking shortage. There was a labor shortage. Right now, we're not seeing that in our space. So logistics are working relatively well, and contractors are in a position that they can do what they need to with their projects day in and day out. So hopefully, that tick off the items that you listed, Stanley? Well, Rohit, it's good to hear your voice. Thank you for the question. If you go across our footprint and you look at what cost of goods sold look like for us, the primary thing that you're going to see is the single biggest cost of goods sold that we have is labor. It's our employees. Then you're going to find a series of others that tend to be in the aggregates business around 12% to 15% of our COGS. That will be things like supplies, other inventories, what's happening with respect to maintenance and repair, et cetera. So if we go back over time and look at what we have done relative to our employee base, the way that we pay them, the tenure that they have, we don't see an inflation situation relative to wages that is anything that we're concerned about.  With respect to maintenance and repair, what you'll see as well is if you go over let's call it the SOAR years, you'll find that we've been very consistent with the way that we deployed capital in our business. What you'll see from that is the continuing thoughtful management of maintenance and repair.  Now one thing that you will see that went up a bit last year is some degrees of DD&A. And DD&A was up in large measure due to what we have done to invest responsibly in the business. So the one item -- and I'll ask Jim to speak to it very specifically, that we think could be a bit of a headwind this year is relative to energy and more specifically with respect to diesel fuel. Because clearly, we've seen that move around a little bit. Diesel fuel was a fairly notable tailwind for our company and for our industry all during 2020 that persisted into Q4. So I'll ask Jim to speak to that.  The other thing I'll ask Jim to speak to is what we saw relative to the sale of some excess properties last year that will likely not repeat. So I think from a inflation perspective, that's going to talk you about energy, but I also want you modeling to be thinking about what we're not going to do or at least replicate relative to land sales. No. Look, I think we'll just see some fairly typical growth in transportation. We're not particularly troubled by that. And keep in mind, most of the transportation, particularly on the quarry side, we're selling stone to quarry. So we're counting on the customers to make transportation arrangements. And typically, when they pick up the stone, risk of loss leaves us as it goes up the scales. I think that's entirely correct, Rohit. Let me ask Jim to respond to that. But yes, go ahead, Jim. So what's going to happen as a practical matter, Josh. If we look at energy overall for the aggregates business, it's going to tend to be about 12%. And of that, diesel fuel is going to be about 8% of that. When we look at energy overall for the Cement business, it's a much larger percentage of the overall cost of goods sold for Cement. And it's tending to be in the 20% range for overall energy. So I think that probably helps bridge that a bit for you. Happy to, Timna. So thank you so much for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Our capital priorities haven't changed, and that is the -- we feel like the best first on our spend is on the right transaction. And several years ago, I remember, we were coming into a year and we said that we thought it could be a year of some notable transactions for the industry. I think the prospect is this could be a year of some notable transactions. We've tried to have ourselves financially and regulatorily in a position that if large transactions or notable transactions or attractive ones came along, we would be in a place that we could play. So if we think about our best first dollar spent, that's it.  Next, we're looking at assuring that we're investing responsively in the business. And if you look at what we've been able to do through cycles relative to CapEx, and as Jim was just indicating, we think we have treated the business really quite well. And if we look at what that has allowed us to do relative to our cost performance, we think that we have been largely outperforming. And then third, to your point, and your very good question is, a return of cash to shareholders. And we've done that through two very different ways, Timna. Number one, we've had a meaningful and a sustainable dividend. And we think both of those words are really important.  So one thing to keep in mind, I believe we're the only heavy side building materials company who can say this, we've never cut a dividend. So the fact is, we've been able to maintain a dividend all the way through cycles. And what's important is this company, even in August, when the world was faced with all the uncertainties from COVID-19, we raised our dividend by 4%. And if you go back and look at where we were the year before that or the year before that, you'll find even bigger increases. So clearly, our Board is going to come back and look at the dividend in August.  As you'll recall as well, when we bought TXI, we issued 20 million shares of stock to combine the companies together. Shortly after that, our Board took the view, okay, our shareholders were good enough to give us license to go and do this with a very high percentage shareholder vote. We're going to make sure over time, opportunistically, we come back and take that dilution back. And we've been on that journey. We've got about 15 million shares left in that authorization. We want to continue chipping away on that. But the conversations we've had with our shareholders have tended to be, if you have the ability to do the right deal, that's where we want you to be. And these are conversations that we're always very frontal with our shareholders because they're our owners at the end of the day. And we want to make sure that we're meeting their needs and their expectations. But that's the priorities. That's how we're looking at it, Timna. So again, I hope that's helpful. Adrian, I really appreciate the question, and it's a good one because here's the dichotomy that we find ourselves in. Last year when most companies were withdrawing guidance, they were certainly encouraged to be forward-leaning and be even more forthcoming into what they might see in the coming months. Part of what we're so pleased with is we feel like we're back in a more normalized state, trending to an even more normalized state, and because of that, we've reinstituted guidance. And our practice has always been, if we had guidance in place to make sure that we were really sticking very close within the four-walls of the quarter in which we're addressing. So I'll talk a little bit -- well, I'll talk a lot more about January when we're together and we're reporting the full -- the quarter results. I'll say this much, part of what we thought was important, was ending the year with momentum, and we thought that we would see it carry into the year. So we'll talk more about the first quarter when we come up with results. But I wanted to give you a sense of why, unlike at least the last two calls, we're not rushing to talk about the month that we're in right now. Look, thank you very much for the question. I think 2 states that we'll particularly watch and they were important states to us last year. And candidly, they don't get depressed, but they should. Indiana had a fantastic year last year. The management team that we have there just ran that business like a Swiss watch last year. And Indiana is getting $238 million more, and they've got a very good highway program there. The other business that performed extraordinarily well last year, and this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, is the business that we have in Maryland in the aftermath of the Bluegrass transaction. Again, Maryland got $150 million coming into that marketplace as well.  So we've talked about how important Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida are, those are 1 through 5. But again, if we see the type of performance, I think we can expect to see in Indiana and what we might see in Maryland, those could be some very nice surprises coming into 2021. I'm not even sure we'd say surprises, but I think that could give some potential nice upside. No, I think that's a great question, Brent. I would say several things. One, we went into '20 with some of the best backlogs we've ever had in North Carolina. And so that allowed us to weather a pretty challenging time in our State. Now I'm probably going to jinx this right now, so I shouldn't say this, but right now, we've had no harsh winter weather in North Carolina either, which means let's face it. At the end of the day, we really don't want to see DOT having to move snow off roads in North Carolina. So I think it's a practical matter of seeing resurfacing projects go, seeing the $700 million from billed NC bonds and utilizing that and a much healthier bidding circumstance on top of the backlogs that we have, make weathering what we've already done much better. And I think it does outline a much brighter 2021 and certainly 2022 and beyond in North Carolina.  So we feel like we have been through the toughest period by far. And that we're going to see the State begin to perform much more in line with what our historical expectations would have been. So Brent, I hope that helps. Well, thank you all for joining our earnings conference call today. Built on our solid foundation of past successes, we're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to drive continued sustainable growth and shareholder value in 2021 and beyond. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2021 results in a few months, and importantly, sharing our strategic priorities with you at our coming Investor Day on February 25. Registration details for this virtual event will be available soon. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time, for your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay well. Take care."

            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We concluded 2020 with the highest full year adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Driving this achievement was our Building Materials business, which delivered record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion, a 1% increase, and record product gross profit of $1.2 billion, a 7% increase. Our Upstream Materials businesses, namely, aggregates and cement, established all-time records for both full year product revenues and gross profit. Aggregates' product gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 30.6%, a new record, and unit profitability improved 8%. These accomplishments, which resulted from strong pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. The Cement business benefited from the planned kiln maintenance outage that occurred through the end of 2019. The timing of that outage resulted in some expenses being recognized in 2019 versus early in 2020. More importantly, that and other capital investments have dramatically improved our cement operations. We achieved 90% kiln reliability this year, up from 82% in 2019, which facilitated increased throughput and fixed cost absorption at both our Midlothian and Hunter plants. These factors, combined with mix adjusted pricing strength and lower fuel costs, contributed to the 510 basis point improvement in Cement product gross margin to 37.8%. Our targeted downstream businesses also delivered solid full year financial results. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin increased 10 basis points to 8.4% as pricing growth offset higher raw material costs. Asphalt and paving achieved gross profit of $60 million and a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin, driven by double-digit revenue growth. Our Magnesia Specialties business returned to revenue and profitability growth during the fourth quarter. The 12% top-line improvement in the quarter, however, was not enough to offset demand declines experienced earlier in the year. As a result, full year product revenues decreased 12% to $221 million. We anticipate fourth quarter strength in line with chemicals demand to continue in 2021, now that steel utilization has rebounded from last summer's COVID-19-driven trough and our cobalt customers are resuming activity. Impressively, product gross margin improved 80 basis points to 40.6% as we proactively responded to lower shipments with effective cost control measures. Turning now to cash generation, capital allocation and liquidity. Martin Marietta ended 2020 with the strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $1.05 billion increased 9%, driven by earnings growth. We continue to balance our longstanding disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain: focus on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment-grade rating profile. For 2020, we invested $360 million of capital into our business and returned $190 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the first quarter repurchase of 211,000 shares of our common stock. In August 2020, our Board approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and continuing Martin Marietta's track record of dividend growth. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. We ended 2020 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which offers us the flexibility to pursue accretive investment opportunities. Our solid balance sheet, combined with $1.1 billion of availability on our credit facilities, provides the financial strength for Martin Marietta to respond and to execute on disciplined capital allocation priorities and continue profitably growing our business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2021 outlook. Good question, Trey. Now we are anticipating, otherwise, hitting a 60% incremental target for next year, but for the diesel headwind. So our incremental is around 40% because of diesel. We've got about $30 million of higher expense from higher oil prices coming through. And we would add 60% but for that. So -- but otherwise, our costs are well behaved. Quite -- we're expecting them to be sort of well controlled as they were in 2020. We expect that to continue. Hold on to the gains we saw in 2020 and build on those 2021. Yes. Sure. So we've got currently forecasted a headwind of $30 million for higher diesel in 2021. WTI is, I think, $58 per barrel, I think I saw this morning. That's the average price that was out there in 2019. So effectively, we're going back to that level of diesel pricing as far as we can tell. So that's already in the forecast. And frankly, that we're holding on to our margins from 2020 and slightly building on those. So we're content in that environment to maintain margins and then offset diesel pricing.  As it relates to the land sale gains that Ward referred to, we had those very large gains in 2020, $70 million worth of gains. Those were hard thought and very much enjoyed, but they are not going to be repeating this year. So as you model out your numbers, we just ask that you look at 2020 EBITDA as a core, maybe pull up as land sale gains and not build on those as repeating into 2021. Yes. From a cost perspective, natural gas is one of our inputs for fuel. That was pretty benign in 2020. We're forecasting that cost to go up slightly in 2021, and that's where you're seeing the margin slightly degrade year-over-year. Does that answer your question? Yes. Well, the natural gas -- I talk about revenues or margins? Margins. Yes. So natural gas is an input for our Cement business to fire the kiln, and we're forecasting those costs to go up. I think it is. We had started out there last year, as you pointed out. And then COVID brought in the level of uncertainty, and we pulled back quite a bit on CapEx 2020. We restored it in 2021. I think 9% -- 8% to 10% of sales is a rough proxy of where our CapEx sits. So you can kind of scale as the business grows, our CapEx will grow accordingly. So $450 million is probably not a bad number to be at. It's a little bit higher than we've been at recently. But again, we brought it down in 2020. So it's quite not a bad number to be at going forward."

All participants are currently in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the Company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors Relation section of our website, Q3 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Effective July 1, in connection with our streamlining our operating structure, we also changed our reportable segments. Our Building Materials business now consists of the East Group, whose operations were previously reported in the Mid-America and Southeast groups, and the West Group, which had no significant changes. In addition, the Magnesia Specialties business comprises our third reportable segment, prior year results have been revised to conform with this new reporting structure. Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance and market trends as we move toward 2021. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and liquidity position, and then Ward will provide some closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Martin Marietta's strong business execution and commitment to operational excellence provide the foundation for our company to consistently deliver record financial, operational and safety performance. As highlighted in today's release, we established new profitability and safety records for the first nine months of 2020. Year-to-date, gross profit increased to $927 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, surpassed the $1 billion mark. We have also achieved the best safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with the company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding world-class levels. For the third quarter, increased pricing across all product lines and disciplined cost management help mitigate anticipated shipment declines driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter financial highlights as compared with the prior-year period included, consolidated gross margin increased 100 basis points to a record 30.6%, despite a 7% reduction in revenues, demonstrating the resiliency of our business and our focus on cost control. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved 10 basis points to an industry-leading 5.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was $502 million inclusive of $70 million of non-recurring gains, and diluted earnings per share was $4.71. For clarity, the non-recurring gains contributed $0.87 per diluted share. These results are a testament to our dedicated and talented employees who are managing through today's challenging public health and economic environment, as well as the proactive steps we've taken to adjust the company's cost profile. Now, for a review of our third quarter operating performance, aggregates shipments declined nearly 9% versus a robust prior-year comparison. As anticipated, given the widespread COVID-19 disruptions across the United States, shipment declines were experienced across our footprint with the East Group down 9% and the West Group down 8%. Additionally, the East Group shipments were impacted by weather delayed projects in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina and reduced wind energy activity in Iowa. Wet weather in Texas and lower energy sector demand negatively impacted West Group shipments. In line with broader macroeconomic trends, aggregates shipments to both the infrastructure and non-residential markets declined, shipments to the residential market improved modestly. Aggregates average selling price increased 2.7% or 4% on a mix-adjusted basis, underscoring this product lines resilient pricing power. By region, the East Group posted a 4.4% pricing increase with strength in our key geographies of North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana and Maryland. The West Group average selling price declined slightly reflecting a lower percentage of higher priced shipments from distribution yards. We continue to see attractive pricing in both Texas and Colorado. On a mix-adjusted basis, the West Group average selling price improved nearly 4%. As a reminder, we anticipate overall full year 2020 aggregates pricing growth of 3% to 4%. Underlying demand for our Texas-based cement business remains positive supported by diversified customer backlogs and large project activity. Third quarter cement shipments, however, decreased 4%, reflecting continued energy sector headwinds. Reported cement pricing increased 1% while average selling prices for our core cement products, namely Type 1 and Type 2 cement were up $4 over the prior-year period, lower shipments of oil well and lightweight specialty cements bound for West Texas disproportionately impacted overall pricing growth. As a reminder, specialty cements can sell for over $200 per ton. On a mix-adjusted basis, overall cement pricing increased 3.4%. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 4% excluding acquired shipments and third quarter 2019 shipments from our Southwest Division's Concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas which we divested earlier this year. Texas construction activity was hindered by wet weather. By contrast, Colorado shipments benefited from favorable weather and continued activity on a large Amazon performance there. Favorable geographic mix from robust Colorado shipments was the primary driver of the 2% increase in third quarter concrete price. Asphalt shipments for our Colorado asphalt and paving business decreased 3% following near record levels in the prior year period. Asphalt pricing increased 6%, reflecting a higher percentage of attractively priced specialty asphalt mixed sales. For our Magnesia Specialties business, weakness in chemicals and lime demand began to moderate during the quarter, as steel utilization rebounded from June\u2019s trough. We expect continued improvement through the balance of the year. Before discussing our preliminary 2021 outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim?\nJames Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to all. For the third quarter, the Building Materials business delivered products and services revenues of $1.2 billion, a 6% decrease from the prior year period and product gross profit of $384 million, a 3% decrease. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 130 basis point to 36.4% an all-time record despite lower shipment volume. Strong mix adjusted pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs contributed to 6.5% growth in aggregates unit profitability. These results demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. Cement product gross margin was 40.2%, a 40 basis point decline. Despite lower revenues, the Cement business benefited from lower fuel cost and prior year tail investments that have improved reliability and throughput. For our downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete product gross margin declined 90 basis, 9.7% attributable, the higher cost to raw material. Asphalt and paving achieved record gross profit of $32 million and a 140 basis point improvement margin despite lower revenue. Magnesia Specialties third quarter product revenues decreased 7% to $55 million reflecting lower demand for chemicals and lime products. So revenues and reduced fixed cost absorption resulted in a 240 basis point decline and product gross margin to 38%. Our consolidated results included $70 million of gains on surplus from non-core land sales and divested assets. These gains, which were recorded in other operating income net are non-recurring and should not be extrapolated in a run-rate calculation. As a reminder, surplus land sales were part of the value proposition of our TXI acquisition and that's exactly what you see in this quarter. Since 2016, we have sold nearly $200 million of excess land that was not used for operations and did not contain operating assets. While we cannot predict the timing of any future land sales, we expect additional non-core real estate divestitures as favorable opportunities develop. We achieved the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history, both inclusive and exclusive of the previously discussed non-recurring gains. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion inclusive of the $7 million non-recurring gains for full year 2020. Now, turning to capital allocation and liquidity. We continue to balance our longstanding disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions and prudent organic capital investment and a consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. In August, we acquired an aggregates and ready-mix concrete company in Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. These acquired operations complement our existing geographic footprint and expand our customer base. We also enhance our aggregates and cement throughput to drive incremental upstream value. We have widened our full year capital expenditures guidance and now expect it to range from $350 million to $400 million. We are exploring additional lifetime exchange opportunities that was defer the taxes we would otherwise pay on this year's sizable land sales. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases in meaningful, sustainable dividend. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and cash generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.28. Share repurchase activity remain temporary pause during the quarter. However, repurchases can resume at management's discretion. With a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2 times, we were at the lower end of our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times. We remain confident in our balance sheet strength with $1.2 billion total liquidity. With our low leverage and ample liquidity, we retain the financial flexibility to continue to profitably grow our business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward for his market trends commentary and preliminary outlooks for 2021.\nHoward Nye: Thanks Jim. We're confident that our favorable pricing dynamics will continue and that attractive underlying fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends across our key geographies will remain intact. To offer some specific color on how this is playing out, it's notable that both our upstream and downstream businesses have seen improvements in daily shipment trends since July lows with October average data shipments above prior year levels. While we're cautiously optimistic about these trends, we believe COVID-19 related uncertainty will likely persist through the winter and spring season. Keeping that in mind, we currently anticipate product demand will remain modest through the first half of 2021 and product pricing will remain strong. As the U.S. economy resets from COVID-19 disruptions, the longer-term macroeconomic indicators such as undeveloped conditions, historically low interest rates and hourly workforce availability are favorable and should support a construction-led recovery. We're seeing encouraging long-term trends across our three primary end use markets and key geographies, including bipartisan support for robust multi-year federal surface transportation reauthorization, heavy industrial activity to support e-commerce and remote work needs and single-family housing expansion, driven by accelerated de-organization. We believe these trends bode well for more aggregates intensive construction cycle that experience during the slow but steady recovery from the Great Recession. Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates intensive highways, roads and streets continues to be resilient. With gas and tax sales revenue shortfalls less than originally anticipated, State Departments of Transportation or DOT budgets are in better condition than expected at the pandemics onset. For example, Texas DOT scheduled lettings for fiscal year 2021 which began September 1 are currently planned at $10 billion, an increase of 35% over the comparable fiscal year 2020 lettings. Updated Colorado DOT projections indicate relatively flat transportation spending levels for 2021 and North Carolina DOT which temporarily suspended awards for certain projects in response to pre-COVID-19 funding issues and other factors, recently revised its letting schedule upward and resume bidding for resurfacing work earlier this month. As a reminder, these three key states represent over 60% of our Building Materials business revenues. On the federal front, the President recently signed into law a continuing resolution that included a one-year extension at the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act at current funding levels which was consistent with our expectations. In our view, this provides state and local governments, the visibility needed to plan, design and let transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Over the medium to long-term future, we expect the industry to benefit from the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal surface transportation package which we anticipate will be enacted by mid-2021. Both the United States House and Senate have advanced federal highway legislation, underscoring bipartisan support to remedy the nation's crumbling surface transportation infrastructure. Notably, both those provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15 years. Regardless of the upcoming election outcomes, increased infrastructure investment, it should provide volume stability and drive aggregates shipments closer to 45% of our total shipments moving us toward our 10-year historical average. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 38% of third quarter shipments. Although certain sectors of non-residential construction remained challenged in the near-term, COVID-19 is driving a paradigm shift that should promote more diverse non-residential demand from the previous cycle, fueling long-term aggregates growth. Accelerating technology, e-commerce and remote work trends require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers which are generally more aggregates intensive than by commercial construction due to the size and scale of these projects. Importantly, we have purposefully shifted our non-residential exposure over the last 10 years or so to be more heavily industrially focused as we've expanded our geographic footprint along major commerce corridors. Additionally, light commercial construction, despite its current weak demand should benefit in the longer-term from the drag along effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments at the non-residential market accounted for 33% of third quarter shipments. Single-family housing is expected to lead this economic recovery as the organization accelerates. Prospective homebuyers are increasingly moving from large metropolitan cities to smaller metro or suburban areas with the pandemic. Recently, North Carolina, our third largest state by revenues, was identified as a top migration destination ranking number seven among states that experienced the most inbound moves from March through August of this year, according to data from United Van Lines. These trends extend beyond those moving from one state to another. They also include existing restaurants opting to move farther out from city centers. Across our Southeastern and Southwestern footprint, under those conditions and favorable population and unemployment dynamics provide Martin Marietta with a distinct competitive advantage for outsized secular growth in single-family housing development. Importantly, single-family housing is two to three times the aggregates intensity, but multi-family housing, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregate shipments to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter shipments. In summary, as our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, navigating challenging times and emerging from them stronger are hallmarks of our company. We've executed a thoughtful strategy and taken deliberate steps to position Martin Marietta as a resilient, efficient and cash flow generative business that can consistently drive shareholder value creation. We will continue to do what we do best. Manage our business safely and responsibly, ensuring that we're prepared to seize profitable growth opportunities for the benefit of our stakeholders. Martin Marietta remains well-positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long-term. With our attractive underlying fundamentals, strategic priorities and best in-class teams, we are excited about our bright prospects for driving long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value in the fourth quarter, in 2021 and well into the future. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTrey Grooms: Well, thanks for taking my question, and thanks for the color. And really, I want to dive in first on the aggregates margins. I mean, very strong, especially given the lower volume and also, one of your highest priced highest market states, North Carolina is pretty challenged, so pretty strong there. And so, Ward, could you update us on maybe some of the cost tailwinds that you're seeing in the aggregates business? Clearly diesel but it seems like there is much more at work here and how do you think about the sustainability?\nHoward Nye: Trey, thanks for the question. No, you are entirely right to put up these numbers, but as you said, North Carolina is not at peak of its game right now, we think it's going to be back to normal, by the way mid half year, next year, but what we've done in this very impressive quarter is done a good by arm and half tied behind our back because North Carolina is down, but it's not going to stay down. Then Magnesia Specialties is going through the foot moral right now, but it's not going to stay down either. So what you're seeing is really a two-fold impact Trey, one, pricing was very good and that's something that we come to expect and you come to expect as have our shareholders. So there are no surprises there. It's nice to see it performing in resilient fashion. Again, one of your closed down to double-digits on volume. But to your point, I think what we're really seeing, even separate and distinct from the energy piece of it, is very good cost performance and that's something that our team has been focused on, it's nothing that's new to Martin Marietta, you can see it also in the SG&A numbers. But if I go through and look at where we'll be not just in energy, but where we'll be relative to contract services, repairs, supplies, and other plant costs, all down, and that's exactly what we would anticipate. As you recall, Trey, we've gone through cycles. We tend to invest very carefully in our company. And when we were going through the financial crisis in the Great Recession, we did pull back on CapEx. At the same time in the last few years, we've taken CapEx up and that has truly been an investment in our business. So what we're seeing the benefits of is a better cost profile, operational excellence, cost performance across the spectrum that we would anticipate. And the other thing that's important, Trey, is the way that we've grown our business. So when we've added businesses as we have in Colorado and what we've done in Texas with TXI and what you're seeing from excess real estate sales and similarly, what we've done with Bluegrass, these have all been enhancing this organization, but it's truly aggregates led and you're seeing good performance come through on the cost side, which again is exactly what we would have expected. And the thing that I've really enjoyed and I am so grateful with this team on is continuing to show their agility and being able to manage that on the fly and as they would need. We're always going to remember 2020 as the year that could have been, because if you're seeing this type of performance with volumes down, you can imagine what I believe we'd be doing this year if we were not in the midst of the pandemic.\nTrey Grooms: Thanks, Ward, that's encouraging and helpful. So my follow-up product demand. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're expecting to be modest through the first half of '21 and pricing will remain strong. Could you go into any more color there for next year, maybe a high-level look at the end markets? And does this imply a return to volume growth in the back half or an acceleration, what's the - what's your messaging there?\nHoward Nye: Trey, that's another great question. I would say several things. I would think in the back half, which is certainly big calling towards volume growth. I mean, here we are in Q3, which is the single largest quarter for the industry, it's the largest quarter for Martin Marietta, and we're down 9%. So, I would expect, in half through next year, we are seeing growth. Keep in mind, half - quarter one is really a rather inconsequential quarter. There is very little volume that goes in Q1. The season really begins in earnest for a business like ours in May because that's when you'll have everything open across an enterprise including those parts of the country, it tend to be more weather-affected. So what I say on a comparative basis, Q1 would be a tough compare, yes, but it's not going to be huge tonnage. As a practical matter, the pandemic really started settling in as we went into Q2. But I would think, when we get to the back half of next year we should start to see the economy grow in some ways. I do think the deurbanization trends that we're seeing, will help us nicely on housing. I think Martin Marietta is going to be a very nice beneficiary of that because you saw the data that I revealed even on North Carolina relative to United Van Lines data, but that same data is true for Georgia, and it's true for Florida, and it's true for Texas, and it's true for Colorado. And again, when we start going through those impacts states, it matters. I think that's something that's real, and we're going launch we go into 2021. The other thing that I would say relative to 2021, Trey, is infrastructure looks a lot better today than we thought, infrastructure was going to look when we were half year. So, if we look back at even for a tech stocks, so they were going to be at half year as they were thinking about 2021. They were $7.5 billion, so they've got a 10 handle in front of that today. We're looking at a state like Colorado, they're saying it's going to be relatively flat, and we know our third largest state by revenue in North Carolina is going to be better, when we get into the second half of the calendar year of 2021. Remember these states work on fiscal years that in large part end on June 30. I think the end use that's going to be the one that we need to watch most carefully is not a surprise to anyone, it's going to be non-residential. And I think you're going to have a tale of two different stories in non-res. I think the heavy side of it, Trey, is going to be pretty good. I mean, I'll give you a sense of it. In the Greater San Antonio area all by itself right now, we are bidding on right for six different Amazon fulfillment centers just in that marketplace. So, we're looking at heavy side non-res in states where we have very intentionally built our business. We think that's going to look attractive. So whether it's data warehousing, warehousing or otherwise, we think that's going to be good. And I do think hospitality is going to be challenged for a while. I think vary degrees of energy on a comparative basis are going to be challenged for a little while and I think office and retail will as well. But here's what I would say, if the housing trends continued the way that we believe that they will, and we believe it's going to be more single-family driven, we're going to see homebuilders buying more land, we're going to see them entitling that land and we're going to see the drag along effect hopefully not in '21 but probably more going into '22 of the light portion of non-res. So what I'll try to do Trey, in response to your question is, go through those three primary end users that we have and speak to at least what we're seeing relative to trends right now. Obviously, when we come out with our full year results in February, then you get the more precise guidance. We'll get much more granularity to that, but again my commentary saying that this October compared to last October looks pretty good. We like that as a data point.\nTrey Grooms: Absolutely. Well, thanks for taking my questions. I do want to say one last thing though. I think this goes overlooked sometimes by the analyst and investor community, but I did want to call out the safety record that you guys have achieved, I mean blasting rock and working around heavy equipment can be a dangerous business, so hats off to you on that achievement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is now open.\nKathryn Thompson: First, focusing on the Cement segment, could you give some more color on the backlogs for this segment, particularly when you look over the next 12 months? And what does this mean for pricing environment, given it was, needless to say, an unusual year this year for pricing? Thanks.\nHoward Nye: No, look, you're right, it's been an unusual year but at the same time, what I'd say Kathryn is, pricing, if we're really looking cement segments it's up 3.4%. So pricing in cement, in Texas is behaving like aggregates. And keep in mind, that's something that we've long said we thought it would be the case. If we look at our cement backlogs, I'll tell you that that's one of the great stories because we're seeing cement backlogs up 24% on strong infrastructure bookings and primarily a large job that Tesla has going on in the Austin area and some property that we sold them. So the backlog situation looks quite good there. And actually the pricing was pretty good, Kathryn. If you look at it, the optics, the pricing and the reality of them are two very different things. Because the reality is, energy sector sales for us, which are not a big amount of tons were down 74% in West Texas. So a big percentage, but small tons. But the reason that's so important and we call it out in the prepared comments, that's where that cement sales were over $200 a ton. So if we're coming back and just looking at Type 1 and Type 2 cement in San Antonio and in Dallas, those numbers are actually up very nicely, and we think that that's likely what we're going to see next year as well. Now, in fairness, we have said that we're going to take cement pricing up in April of next year and we have a letter out to that effect right now and we're talking about $9 in that Texas marketplace next year. So I think that gives you a sense of how pricing has behaved this year, what has been the mix effect on it, what this Type 1 and Type 2 look like. The other thing that I'll note Kathryn, because this is important too, is we have continued to see efficiency improvement quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year in our cement business. So kind of what I would call out for you is volume is down, but the cement EBITDA in Q3, the margin of 46.2%, represents actually a new quarterly record. So we're getting it both ways, we're doing it the hard way on costs, but we're doing it the other way on pricing as well, but again backlogs up 23%. We're a little bit over 270,000 tons.\nKathryn Thompson: And then the follow-up question is more on the infrastructure side, particularly with state DOTs. You have confirmed that in all of the Gulf issues, that the worst appears to be behind for North Carolina. Could you - just got to confirm what gives you optimism for that, but also looking at other key states like Georgia, who is still continuing to move along and Texas and other key markets that are important for you, from an infrastructure standpoint. Particularly against the backdrop of how they are looking into next year? Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Sure. Happy to, couple of things. One, Texas, I'll just go through them in order of revenues. So Texas has huge FY '20, '21 lettings of $10.2 billion, we spoke about that just a minute ago. That's going to have a multi-year benefit to Martin Marietta. Our backlogs in that state are up in all three product lines and we see some very large projects coming in 2021. What's important to our members across seven funding is currently projected at a full $2.5 billion, even as we're looking at cropped one that's looking at $620 million. And keep in mind, none of that anticipates Texas having to tap into their $10 billion rainy day funds. So again, Texas feels very healthy even compared to where we were half year. Colorado looks pretty flattish and that's what we are expecting. We see construction activity there that's being supported by about a $1.8 billion four-year bond program. Two years remain on that and that could provide an additional $1 billion or more. So we're feeling good about where that state is, again, a nice improvement over where it was at half year. The North Carolina DOT situation that you called out very specifically and appropriately is improving. And part of what we've seen even in the last week is North Carolina mail is sending out some double A-rated bonds, they were just rated last week. It's going to be $700 million of build North Carolina bonds. And importantly, the state has started - what we started lettings and anticipates about $1.3 billion of it - of FY '21 lettings and that's pretty similar to the pre-pandemic numbers of about $1.4 billion. So again, we're feeling much better about North Carolina and that's one that we obviously stay very close to. Similarly, you asked about Georgia and we're anticipating there relatively flat DOT spending at about $2 billion. But part of what we think is important is it appears that Georgia is going to advance at least two of the major mobility projects in Atlanta. They're not going to have a '21 start, but they're likely to have a '22 start. And remember, these are major mobility projects at about $12 billion and their primary aim is to reduce congestion along key corridors in Georgia. And the last one, at least in our top five is Florida DOT, and again, we're looking at something there that we think is going to be very steady year-over-year. Keep in mind, they've got a very healthy P3 program in that state, so you've got a lot of activity in Florida. So again, if we look at our top five states and that's exactly what I've just taken you through from an infrastructure perspective, year-over-year, we like the looks of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane. Your line is open.\nPaul Roger: It's Paul Roger. Yes, can you just say they - obviously, it's a big week next week with the election, can you just speak a bit about the potential implications of the different outcomes? And also, if there is a new highway bill or maybe some stimulus as well, when you think that would impact demand on the ground, is it likely to be a 2022 story?\nHoward Nye: Paul, thanks for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Yes, I would say that we are one of the few industries that probably can't lose next week and here's what I mean by that. If the President is re-elected, we anticipate there is going to be a new highway bill and we think it's probably going to be up very similar to the Senate's number, that's 28% over FAST Act and that being the largest increase all by itself in 15 years. Similarly, if we should have a change in part of the White House and Mr. Biden is elected and the fact is, the democratic-controlled House is looking at a 41% increase in highway spending. So here's what I would say, if the President's re-elected, it's going up and it's going up with less regulation. If Mr. Biden is elected, it's going up with probably more regulation. And the irony of that is, we actually do pretty well with regulation. Well, we've got great teams, they are very sophisticated, they can deal with that very efficiently. So we - I believe, either way, Martin Marietta will be well-positioned. If there is more regulation, one of the things that we certainly see that drive in the past is perhaps more M&A opportunity as well, because often times, if you're looking at a higher tax, higher regulatory environment, closely-held kind of businesses start reconsidering what their long-term future is as well. So, as we sit here and anticipate what different outcomes could be, it can change the way that we're going to think about some things around the margin, but in large measure, we think under either one of those scenarios, Martin Marietta does very well.\nPaul Roger: And that's very clear. I mean, within spinning your opening remarks, you inferred that this would have obviously been a fantastic year were it not the COVID. If you see a situation where we do get some volume growth again in 2021, are you basically suggesting there is a lot so if you can go on the margins? And I guess particularly if some of the more profitable market, like the Carolina's stabilized all good.\nHoward Nye: Well, I would say a couple of things. One, volume will always be this industry's friend because you're going to have a certain degree of cost, but as much as we'd like to be at a flex costs as much as we can, some of them are going to be fixed, it's a big heavy industry, but I think we control cost extraordinarily well. Again, I think geography, from a mixed perspective, actually this quarter, was not particularly upper end. So, if we see these Eastern markets behaving in a more robust fashion and volume hits those markets, it could be pretty impressive relative to margin. Keep in mind, in the East this year, we saw a significant project delays and we saw extremely wet weather in what was formerly the Mid-Atlantic Division. And again, we've discussed the fact that we saw lower NCDOT funding, that's going to be remedy, and we saw most win part activity. So, if we look at that didn't happen in the East and things that we don't think will continue to recur into the future, we think that's probably very attractive for our margins. The other thing that I would say is I would not expect the cost that we have been very good at controlling this year to go backwards on us. I think the investments that we have made on capital will be our friend. Now in fairness, there is a piece of that that's tied up in energy and there are a lot of things we can control. I wish, I could tell you that we could control overall energy prices, but we can't, but at the same time, as energy has tended to move upward, keep in mind, that's also served historically as the mechanism plus to make sure that we can cover that with increased average selling prices as well. So, I do think relative to margins, geography is likely to be more of a friend, they are not going forward, and I think this is the type of cost performance that you should expect us to continue to deliver.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJerry Revich: Ward, in your opening remarks, you were optimistic about pricing into '21, which is really interesting considering pricing typically falls volumes, and obviously we're looking at a pretty tough back half of this year and first half of '21. So could you just expand on those comments, what's enabling you to achieve the strong pricing and what have you announced the customers for '21 if I got the gist of your opening remarks right?\nHoward Nye: No, you did, Jerry. I guess what I would say is that, I'm not sure if there was anything strikingly new about the observations I was making on '21. I think the primary thing that I just want to underscore is that pricing is something that we tend to do really well in Martin Marietta. When volumes go up, pricing goes up, when volumes go down, pricing still goes up. And in this quarter I thought it was pretty good, because there are not a lot of industries that could come forward with volume down line and pricing up the way that we saw pricing up this year. So I think that's the underlying theme that I want to make sure that I underscore. I think the other thing to remember, Jerry, is we're seeing that as we pointed out in some of the conversations we've had, with actually one of our higher-priced - higher profitable businesses not at the top of their game this year, because of what's not coming out of NCDOT. So again, I think we'll continue to see a good price trajectory in large part because we're in many good locations. And I think as we continue to see superfamily housing go up, that's actually an area that we tend to do quite well in housing on, because if you're thinking about people who will at least try to utilize some form of volume, on occasion, as a lever to talk to you about pricing, that's typically not the home door, because at the end of the day, there is so many things they care deeply about in the home, but the news flash is the price of crushed stone usually is not one of them. So I think if we end up seeing a new highway bill, we see the volume that we think will come from that, probably not in '21, but as practical matter coming in '22, but we see a very healthy residential market and then we see the drag along in the growth of time of the like non-res. I think all of that pretends very well for pricing. And again, if we look at those top five states that are disproportionately important to us and you look at even what's happened with cement pricing in Texas, I think that tells you that the overall marketplace is at a pretty healthy spot.\nJerry Revich: And so we're normally in this type of volume environment, I would have thought aggregates pricing should be up in the 2% range. And it sounds like, based on your comments that, you're announcing the customers is more or like the pricing we saw in '20 than what I'm describing.\nHoward Nye: Well, and again, we'll give you even more granularity around that when we come out in February, because some of those conversations are still ongoing. But again, I think you get the overall sense that there is nothing in our pricing model that we feel like has been shaken by this strange time to the world navigating together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Ward on the decision to re-establish full-year guidance, I mean is it fair to say you were surprised by the resilience you saw in your end markets or maybe some of those cost factors that boosted margins, or was it just more of a function of having one quarter left in the year? I'm just wondering if you could talk - you kind of walk us through the decision-making process and what you saw specifically that may be comfortable with re-establishing the guide.\nHoward Nye: Yes, Anthony, thank you for the question. I think part of it is - you could deepen up into something that strange and you start to figure it out a little bit. So, I think candidly, that's part of it. The other - another part of it is, Anthony, there is just not that much runway left this year and we've got a pretty good sense of how October is looking. Obviously, Q4 itself can have some swing factors to it, and obviously one of them is, when does weather really set in earnest. It's been interesting Anthony, because there have been years that we have been paving almost up to Christmas in Colorado and equally, there have been years that well before Thanksgiving, it was shut down. So, obviously, we'll try to bracket but we think Q4 can like from just a volume perspective, we know what it's going to look like from a pricing perspective. And we believe we've got a pretty good handle on what it's going to look like from a cost perspective as well. So, I think those were the factors candidly that went into it and again in the conversation that I was having just a few minutes ago with Jerry and others on the end users. We're trying to get as - we are just taking a look into '21 as we can, but again, we feel pretty good about all of them.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay, that's very helpful. And then you talked about some of the project delays that you saw earlier in the year. I'm just wondering from a big picture perspective, the pace of project delays or cancellations that you saw over the course of the quarter, did that pace - was apparently stable or did it is ease, maybe you saw some more projects come back than you expected or any kind of general thoughts there.\nHoward Nye: Yes, I would say several things. One, we see deferrals, we don't see cancellations and I think that's an important bifurcation to draw, because pushing projects to the right is an entirely different animal than calling them off. So during the financial crisis in the Great Recession, we saw projects cancel, that's not what we're seeing. So I want to call that. The other is, in some instances, we simply saw weather deferrals. So obviously, we've had some hurricanes that have come in through the Southwest this year and we've had a good bit of rain in the Southeast. But the primary place that, again, I think we're taking some good comfort is when we're seeing North Carolina DOT start re-letting some surface transportation again, in some respects for the first time in almost a year. So when we see that state beginning to return to something that feels more like in a patience, a normal start as rhythm, that certainly feels better to us. So we're - we did not see anything relative to deferrals in the quarter that we thought were extraordinary or surprised us. And in many respects, what I would say is from a volume perspective, I don't think we're very surprised this quarter. I think from a pricing perspective, we were not surprised. And I'm not going to tell you that from a cost perspective we were surprised, I would tell you, gratified, is probably the right word, but again, we expect to see more of that going into the future, not less up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nStanley Elliott: Thank you for taking the question. Ward, when you talked about or talking to your residential contractors, are you getting a sense that they're actually looking to buy land now and build out new subdivisions or that, they're busy enough just keeping pace with what they are? And I am curious kind of in the context that we've heard about a lot of delays for higher lumber prices and things like that. Any thoughts to what extent that could be kind of a governor on the residential recovery into next year?\nHoward Nye: Stanley, that's a great question. And what I think is this, one, they're busy and busy usually begets busy. And number two, I do think the shift that we're seeing in the Great American move - moving more away from multifamily, moving to single-family where people frankly want some space but they haven't had for the last several years is going to lead to the necessity of buying more land. And by the way, we don't think that's a bad thing. We actually think that's a good thing, because if we look at the markets in which we are operating one, they tend to have land, two, the entitlement for new subdivisions isn't something that's highly difficult to do, and three, the ability to borrow money is there. So we feel like all of that's important. The other piece of it, Stanley, that we think is important is these markets are not overbuilt and that's such a fundamentally different place. And part of what we spoke about in the half-year call is, we've seen single-family move around over the last couple of decades. So single-family recovery is, we're really looking at coming out with the great financial crisis. So also about 70% of starts versus what had typically been closer to 80%. So if we're seeing it move back to a more of a normalized portion of what we would expect single-family to be, particularly as we're looking at these deurbanization trends, that is we're looking at states in which we have a significant presence, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida. Those are going to be cities and those are going to be states that would be grown out, not states that will be growing up and places that are growing out tend to be more aggregates intensive. So yes, I think our builders are busy. Yes, I think they will have to buy more land. I think they will be in the entitlement business but I think in the areas where we are the entitlements, would not end up being significant, I'll have to use your word, I think it's a good one, a governor, on what housing growth is going to look like.\nStanley Elliott: Great. And then just switching gears, thinking about kind of the leverage range that you guys have talked about operating in the past, I mean you are kind of there right now. Barring any sort of thing on the CapEx side, it should be another good year of cash flow. How - are you more comfortable given the uncertain environment to kind of let the cash build? Is there some things on the M&A front that seem intriguing right now, just curious how you're thinking about the capital deployment into next year.\nHoward Nye: Stanley, that's a great question and you're right, we're at the low end of our range. So our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at two times today. You've seen that steadily come down and I'm proud of the way that we pulled that down. As you know, our capital priorities have not changed. And our capital priorities are to find the right acquisition. We think there may be some opportunities in 2021 that we're certainly looking at, the deal pipeline has become more active here over the last few months and that does not surprise us. And equally, the other thing that we're waiting to watch and everybody else in this call is too, what happens in the election? And it will be odd. For example, if we do see a wider new streak go to the United States and we see a higher regulatory regime come in, as I indicated earlier, we have certainly seen that as something that they can serve as a bit of a catalyst for M&A activity as well. So I think we want to make sure that we keep ourselves in a very flexible spot. Obviously, it's in management's discretion whether we go in and turn back on the repurchases, we will certainly look at that and think through it carefully. You did see us - as Jim commented in his opening comments, we raised our dividend in September, so our September shareholders have already benefited from that. So I like where we sit from a balance sheet perspective, but equally Stanley, and I think this is important as we think about M&A, I like where we sit from a regulatory perspective as well. The areas the country where we would be most interested in growing particularly if we're looking to establish new footprints. We've got a lot of white space and we have a lot of regulatory ability, from a Hart-Scott-Rodino perspective. And I think our teams have proven that they are very good at one, identifying transactions, number two, going through the process of memorializing it and then upon closing, pulling the synergy side of it as well. So we're going to find good uses for that cash, whether it's investing in Martin Marietta, returning to shareholders or finding right deal, but you know how we rank those in order, Stanley.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois: On non-residential construction, is there any way to quantify how much of the non-res volume split is between the heavy industrial piece versus the retail and office, just given the shift you've made more towards the heavy non-res side over the last several years?\nHoward Nye: Absolutely, Stanley. Stanley, as you recall, historically, non-res would have been around 30% of our business and then over the last several quarters, you've seen it actually considerably more than that, it's closer to the mid-30s. And you'll recall historically, this was really when I give you this background. This is pre-TXI, this is pre river for the Rocky's, this is pre-Bluegrass. We would have said, it's almost a 50-50 break between light on one hand and heavy on the other. As we've done these large transactions, as we come out of the river, as we have focused our business increasingly on these large commerce corridors, we feel like it - now the heavy side of it is probably at least 60%. So it's probably moved that much just as we've done these transactions. And it's interesting to go back and revisit that number I gave just a few minutes ago, even talking about the fact that in the San Antonio area right now, we're bidding on seven Amazon warehouses data center projects at various stages of bidding. So the locations where we've been, whether it's on the I-25 corridor, whether it's on the I-35 corridor, whether it's on the l-85 corridor or the l-95 corridor has really helped move that. And if you think about those corridor, l-95 was significantly changed by Bluegrass. I-85 was significantly changed about what we did with the assets that we acquired in Atlanta. l-35 was significantly changed by what we did with TXI and I-25 was completely remade with what we did in the River for the River - I mean River for the Rocky swap. So the percentage shift is probably 60%, 40% today but again, non-res has moved to a bigger piece of the pie in large measure, because infrastructure has underperformed as we've gone through a series of re-authorizations that unlike next year, has not gone up in value over the last 15 years.\nGarik Shmois: Okay, thanks for that. Also just wanted to follow up on the guidance that you provided for the year. I don't want to focus too much on 4Q because it's a seasonally slower part of the year, but just given that...\nHoward Nye: Yes.\nGarik Shmois: How you provided on the October growth, I mean what do you think is driving the increase? Is it project timing, catch up from maybe some of the weather headwinds that you saw in 3Q? And then maybe just more broadly, how to calibrate the different ends of the guidance ranges?\nHoward Nye: Yes, I think several things probably. One, we don't have some things going on this year that we had going on last year. They were actually varying degrees of headwinds last year. So if you go back to it, part of what you'll see is, we did have some increased grading last year we're stripping employees, we did accelerate some maintenance at our Hunter Cement Plant. And our Granite Canyon quarry which sits in Southern Miami, which feeds that very vibrant Northern Colorado market was later coming on last year, then we would have hoped. And then Hurricane Dorian sided with Freeport Bahamas last year, a little bit longer that we would have wished though. Number one, they actually put some headwinds in Q4 last year and we're thinking we're probably past some of that this year, but equally, I think the October trends are nice. I think part of what we're seeing is some of the work, particularly in Central Texas as Tesla is building their bigger factory on the property that we sold them, that certainly add some benefits. And again, if we see something that feels like a normal winter cadence, we're very comfortable with what we feel like would be the midpoint of that range. So it - that at least gives you a sense of what the puts and takes would be in the little bit of the year that's left. I hope that's helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nPhil Ng: If we think of some of the policy optionality go into next year. If we get a stimulus package this is separate from a longer-term authorization bill.\nHoward Nye: Yes.\nPhil Ng: Do you see that impact coming through a little quicker on the demand side where the lag is shorter because maybe states can dial-up lettings mid-year and see a benefit 2021? And then...\nHoward Nye: Yes.\nPhil Ng: \u2026typically it's like a year plus lag. Okay, so you can\u2026\nHoward Nye: No, Yes, I think they can, because part of what's happened, Phil is, if we go back over time, several things. If you look at the way different states came out of the financial crisis, some states ended up hiring more people in DOTs, Texas is a good example. Some states started doing more outsourcing, North Carolina is a good example, which means at least as we're sitting here today, they have more projects that are engineered the designed, right-of-way has been purchased and they're in a position if they want to go that they can. And I think that's a very fundamentally different place. So to your point, if there is a pace for or if there is anything else and there is simply as you know, AASHTO has long been advocating for about $37 billion that they feel like should go roughly to states to help fill the hole that was created because yes, tax revenues weren't there. Now keep in mind, early in the year, they said that hole is going to be $50 billion, so that hole got a lot narrower or - not as deep over time. But to your point, if that money went directly to NCDOT, do they have plenty of uses for today? Absolutely. It's weather floating $400 million worth of bonds, could Texas do the same thing? To be sure, and could Colorado do the same thing? Absolutely, because again if you look at that state they are metering out there buying activity over time and that can simply come in and help augment that. So I do think your point's a good one, because most of what we've been discussing to date has been around the reauthorized bill and what the timing would look like on that. And again, we're saying passage in '21, but the real event from a tonnage is probably '22. But I do think if you've got some near-term stimulus that could actually be at '21 about.\nPhil Ng: And then I think the margins in the quarter is certainly really impressive in light of the weaker volumes. But when we think out the 2021, assuming you have a little inflation not deflation like you've seen this year on energy, and you get some pricing and lower volumes. Do you have enough levers there to kind of drive unit economics higher or at least keep it flat and any color on the gross margin side as well.\nHoward Nye: Yes, that, I - we'll obviously give you some really good guidance on that in February, but I think part of what we're trying to outline bill is, this is a really impressive quarter with volumes down almost double-digits and our most profitable business with its arm tied behind its back. So again, our backlogs, for example, in Texas look very good. So I think we can feel good about where that business is heading into '21. Obviously NCDOT is letting some jobs. I think we've been increasingly good about that. If the Eastern business gets some momentum going into '21 even in the back half, so that's where your story would be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSeldon Clarke: I guess just based on where October is trending right now and obviously, weather can be a prevention to this. But just based on where October is trending and how you're positioned from a non-resi perspective, and the improvement there you're talking to in regards to the outlook for state and federal funding. Is it fair then to say that 3Q will probably represent the steepest of the volume declines throughout this sort of downturn?\nHoward Nye: Yes, that wouldn't surprise me. And again we'll come out with more granular information in February. But if we think about it, Seldon, this is the big quarter and keep in mind, this was a big quarter last year. So this was the beast of compares. And it's always interesting to look at how percentages can work in Q1, but I would suggest you percentages in Q1 helped me a lot because the tonnage is so slow. So it would not surprise me but this on a percentage down, unless we see things just changed dramatically. It would not surprise me that this would be your states single steepest client, to use your words.\nSeldon Clarke: And then you gave some context around aggregates potentially going from 38% to 45% of the shipments with one of these highway bills. But I guess, just can you just help us understand sort of the relationship between a 28% or 45% increase in annual spending on coming from the government? And how that relates to your actual product demand, if we go back and look at some of these historical highlights...\nHoward Nye: Yes. I guess...\nSeldon Clarke: It was actually 28% growth. So how do you think about that?\nHoward Nye: Yes. I guess the way we think of it, if we look at the states in which we see significant population trends and then that's going to be our top five states, where there will be capacity needs and capacity issue. So if you take that Georgia mobility program and think about that in more than just an Atlanta contracts and you think about the Atlanta, but you think also about Columbia, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida and Orlando and Raleigh and Charlotte, and then you start looking at 9 miles added. That's your single most aggregates intensive undertake because several things happen. So then it's taking a lot of tonnage, but it's taking a lot of vary tonnage as well. So you are you putting based products down, you are venture to put in clean stone and either asphalt or concrete and that's going down. So you're taking the entire way of more products. So number one, that's actually very healthy for inventories. Number two, it's actually very healthy for the way that we can run our business. Now can you take a crushing plant, hold it in some degree and produce less space and more clean stone so we - but I mean it's not a science and doing that because it's not that easy, but as a practical matter, if you've got a wider array of products going out that will intend to be the case, if you have a new highway bill and you've got capacity that is being added in states. What that does from an operating efficiency and what it does from an inventory efficiency is incredibly helpful. And part of that we've seen over the last several years is what would appear to be a fairly significant outperformance in non-residential. And what I would tell you is non-residential has actually been quite good but non-residential hasn't been really on fire. It's really that the public side of it has been slower than it should have been. So if we see more infrastructure go, it's high spec material, it's a material that we can deliver and we think of these states in which we're operating as they add needed capacity, it adds tonnage and it adds efficiency. I hope that helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\nDavid MacGregor: So, I guess lot has been covered here in the past hour, so I'll just make a couple of quick ones. I guess in ready-mix, it seems like maybe there's just a price pass through issue, do we catch that up in the fourth quarter? Is this just a timing issue or is there something maybe more structural in the markets that's coming in the play here?\nHoward Nye: No, I would say several things, one, we saw good price in Colorado and we saw some mix shifts in Texas. So I think that's largely what you see. And look, the other piece of it is, hey, the concrete business paid more for aggregates and the concrete business paid more for cement and that's okay from where we sit, because we're providing most of the aggregates and we're providing most of the cement and so that's a lot of what was going on there. But really, if you look at it, nice 2.2% per ton better on ASP. So a lot of good things that we're seeing in ready-mix right now, but in large measure, it helps undergo a very attractive upstream business, so it's doing exactly what we would have thought.\nDavid MacGregor: Right, right. Second question is really just on Houston and in aggregates, you talked about the lower rail tons going into Houston. Is that a function just what's happening in energy or are you seeing congestion or any reduced level of service in rail?\nHoward Nye: Well, service and rail has been reasonably good and it's really not so much Houston, it's really more South Texas when you get down to the pure LNG projects that are - or even closer to the water. And that was really a piece of the mix issues in the Southwest, because if we had fewer tons coming out of those yards, as you know those tons are transportation loaded, David, so that was really the big shift there. So it wasn't as much of our Houston metro per se issue because there is some very good projects going on in Houston, including the Grand Parkway. And for example, we've seen a good amount of cement go to that and as you may recall that, actually cement is modestly lower priced in San Antonio than it is in Dallas and things are going to the Grand Parkway are really coming out of Hunter facility. So we're not seeing bad activity in Houston, whatsoever, it was really more cost to oriented on that commentary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Dudas: Ward, we appreciate the insight on your - some of your tops important states, but maybe you can highlight quiet a couple in the - on the second side or others where you've seen some either positive or negative trends that might be helpful to help out a little bit more on say that the volume expectations is some of these macro events impact second quarter '21 and '22.\nHoward Nye: Look, I'll certainly time and if we're looking at South Carolina, they're going to FY 2021 program would buy $1.8 billion, that's up about 15%, so we like what we're seeing there. The South Carolina did something the other year that was very on South Carolina of them and that is they raise the gas tax. So they are taking that up incrementally over a period of six years. We're about halfway through that, so we're seeing good activity there. All of that, we're really Arkansas passed a 10-year $10 billion funding plan so that basically doubles their funding over $8 billion over a 10-year plan and we like where we see that business going. Keeping in mind, we've got a very attractive business in and around Arkansas City and we're seeing good activity at the airport there as well. Our business in Indiana, just to be clear, we call it our Indiana district that we have historically, it's really our Indianapolis district and what we've seen in that business and the leadership there has just done a superb job of controlling costs exceptionally well. I mean they really do deserve a call out on that, but they equally done very well and making sure we're getting good recognition on pricing on what we're doing in that marketplace. I think Indiana is looking quite strong. If I'm looking questions just to be completely open book with you on where we've seen more difficulty this year, it's been in places like Kentucky and portions of Savina Hill. Kentucky DOT has not had its finest moment this year and I think equally you've heard that from others is they have gone through, I think you would have heard a bit of that from Summit and its commentary earlier in the week as well. But if we're looking at places like Maryland, and we're looking at Virginia, and Iowa, in Nebraska, and as going through those, just give you a sense of it, Michael, that does round out our top 10 states which is going to be 85% of our revenue. They're not things that we feel like are troubling to us as we looked at Maryland, Virginia, Iowa, or Nebraska right now, again, Maryland has a very significant T3 program, and the other states just tend to be very solid states. Remember, Iowa consume on average more stone per capita than any place else because they go through a hard place sale cycle each year and it's a big farm to market economy, but equally that's been an economy that has been served quite well by what's happening relative to data warehousing. So we've seen Microsoft and Amazon and others, not just build warehousing but Phases 2 or Phases 3 and sometimes Phases 4 of that, so that's actually been quite good. The one area in the Midwest that has been more challenging this year has been plus not happened relative to wind energy and we call that out on some of the commentary that we had just breaking down between business in our East Group and business in our West Group, but hopefully that was responsive to taking a little bit deeper dive in the bottom five.\nMichael Dudas: We're certainly was and I wasn't treating about the factoring on Iowa I was not aware of. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: That's would what we give for. Take care, Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Can I ask a quick question, and then I'll turn it over. But I wanted to ask on ready-mix, if you could comment on the backlogs in ready-mix and also the outlook for pricing forth?\nHoward Nye: No, no, happy to. I mean, it's interesting, but are different pricing is always a little bit challenging at least in half, outlook and pricing in Colorado tends to be very attractive pricing, outlook on pricing in Texas continues to look pretty steady. I would tell you is we look at backlogs year-over-year, there are 3% and if you're looking at a very dynamic market I like the way that works. So, again part of what we've done in Texas in particular item is, we've moved a certain degree of our volume in Texas from infrastructure, in some instances to housing and I will tell you very candidly, why we did it, we wanted to have it and a little bit more of that in housing, one, because housing look good; and two, housing does not tend to be as weather-sensitive it's infrastructure as. Now that said, housing tends to have a little bit lower ASPs. So we're picking and choosing very much by design there, but again we think pricing will be solid and we think backlogs in that business right now are actually up in the Southwest.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAdrian Huerta: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to just to ask on, you have mentioned in the past there was room on recent acquisitions to increase prices, how far are you on that, is there still room to increase prices from recent acquisitions?\nHoward Nye: Adrian, it's always a journey, it's like safety, we never think we're done. And what I would say if we go back and look at the way things have worked. One of the best examples I can give you is Maryland and we were talking about just a moment ago with Michael, what some of the states look like that were not in our top five and I spoke, specifically the Maryland. And then what's interesting to me on that, Adrian, is Maryland for us in the Bluegrass transaction was not necessarily a consolidation play. We had a couple of facilities in that state there in the western part of the state, and most of what we acquired Bluegrass there was in Maryland, who was really more in Baltimore metro. And what we brought to that is a discipline and we brought to it a sense of not being ashamed to make sure we are getting the right value for a product that we're making that needs, state and federal specifications, and that we think it's not easy to do. And keeping in mind that, on the infrastructure side, stone is about 10% of the cost of building road, on the housing side, it's about 2% of the cost of a home and if we look at non-residential at somewhere between those two numbers. In other words, our product is never going to be, but it's going to make or break whether the project goes or not. Equally, our product isn't going to make or break whether that contractors typically low or not, but at the same time to do what we do with the scale that we do and do it as safely as we do. We want to make sure we're getting good value for something that's a depleting resource. Now that said, if we look on average at today's rates of taking start on the ground, we've got a century with reserves left. So we don't have an issue of the stone going away, but in a world that we think will continue to have higher regulatory barriers and burdens to entry, making sure we're getting value for this product is important. I will tell you, equally, you can see what our average selling prices and it's going to be in the low teens, right now, but there are plenty of markets in the United States where we're selling aggregates for numbers that have a two in front of it and we don't see those higher numbers having any degree of chilling effect on construction in those markets. So this has been an area for our company that has been one of strength for a long time. Back to my point, this continues to be a journey. I think it's going to be an area of strength for years yet to come, Adrian.\nHoward Nye: Thank you all for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Moving forward, we are confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, safety and operational performance and remain focused on maximizing value for all shareholders. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.",

            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. Martin Marietta's strong business execution and commitment to operational excellence provide the foundation for our company to consistently deliver record financial, operational and safety performance. As highlighted in today's release, we established new profitability and safety records for the first nine months of 2020. Year-to-date, gross profit increased to $927 million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, surpassed the $1 billion mark. We have also achieved the best safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with the company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding world-class levels. For the third quarter, increased pricing across all product lines and disciplined cost management help mitigate anticipated shipment declines driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter financial highlights as compared with the prior-year period included, consolidated gross margin increased 100 basis points to a record 30.6%, despite a 7% reduction in revenues, demonstrating the resiliency of our business and our focus on cost control. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved 10 basis points to an industry-leading 5.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was $502 million inclusive of $70 million of non-recurring gains, and diluted earnings per share was $4.71. For clarity, the non-recurring gains contributed $0.87 per diluted share. These results are a testament to our dedicated and talented employees who are managing through today's challenging public health and economic environment, as well as the proactive steps we've taken to adjust the company's cost profile. Now, for a review of our third quarter operating performance, aggregates shipments declined nearly 9% versus a robust prior-year comparison. As anticipated, given the widespread COVID-19 disruptions across the United States, shipment declines were experienced across our footprint with the East Group down 9% and the West Group down 8%. Additionally, the East Group shipments were impacted by weather delayed projects in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida, anticipated lower infrastructure shipments in portions of North Carolina and reduced wind energy activity in Iowa. Wet weather in Texas and lower energy sector demand negatively impacted West Group shipments. In line with broader macroeconomic trends, aggregates shipments to both the infrastructure and non-residential markets declined, shipments to the residential market improved modestly. Aggregates average selling price increased 2.7% or 4% on a mix-adjusted basis, underscoring this product lines resilient pricing power. By region, the East Group posted a 4.4% pricing increase with strength in our key geographies of North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana and Maryland. The West Group average selling price declined slightly reflecting a lower percentage of higher priced shipments from distribution yards. We continue to see attractive pricing in both Texas and Colorado. On a mix-adjusted basis, the West Group average selling price improved nearly 4%. As a reminder, we anticipate overall full year 2020 aggregates pricing growth of 3% to 4%. Underlying demand for our Texas-based cement business remains positive supported by diversified customer backlogs and large project activity. Third quarter cement shipments, however, decreased 4%, reflecting continued energy sector headwinds. Reported cement pricing increased 1% while average selling prices for our core cement products, namely Type 1 and Type 2 cement were up $4 over the prior-year period, lower shipments of oil well and lightweight specialty cements bound for West Texas disproportionately impacted overall pricing growth. As a reminder, specialty cements can sell for over $200 per ton. On a mix-adjusted basis, overall cement pricing increased 3.4%. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 4% excluding acquired shipments and third quarter 2019 shipments from our Southwest Division's Concrete business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas which we divested earlier this year. Texas construction activity was hindered by wet weather. By contrast, Colorado shipments benefited from favorable weather and continued activity on a large Amazon performance there. Favorable geographic mix from robust Colorado shipments was the primary driver of the 2% increase in third quarter concrete price. Asphalt shipments for our Colorado asphalt and paving business decreased 3% following near record levels in the prior year period. Asphalt pricing increased 6%, reflecting a higher percentage of attractively priced specialty asphalt mixed sales. For our Magnesia Specialties business, weakness in chemicals and lime demand began to moderate during the quarter, as steel utilization rebounded from June's trough. We expect continued improvement through the balance of the year. Before discussing our preliminary 2021 outlook, I'll now turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim? Thanks Jim. We're confident that our favorable pricing dynamics will continue and that attractive underlying fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends across our key geographies will remain intact. To offer some specific color on how this is playing out, it's notable that both our upstream and downstream businesses have seen improvements in daily shipment trends since July lows with October average data shipments above prior year levels. While we're cautiously optimistic about these trends, we believe COVID-19 related uncertainty will likely persist through the winter and spring season. Keeping that in mind, we currently anticipate product demand will remain modest through the first half of 2021 and product pricing will remain strong. As the U.S. economy resets from COVID-19 disruptions, the longer-term macroeconomic indicators such as undeveloped conditions, historically low interest rates and hourly workforce availability are favorable and should support a construction-led recovery. We're seeing encouraging long-term trends across our three primary end use markets and key geographies, including bipartisan support for robust multi-year federal surface transportation reauthorization, heavy industrial activity to support e-commerce and remote work needs and single-family housing expansion, driven by accelerated de-organization. We believe these trends bode well for more aggregates intensive construction cycle that experience during the slow but steady recovery from the Great Recession. Infrastructure activity, particularly for aggregates intensive highways, roads and streets continues to be resilient. With gas and tax sales revenue shortfalls less than originally anticipated, State Departments of Transportation or DOT budgets are in better condition than expected at the pandemics onset. For example, Texas DOT scheduled lettings for fiscal year 2021 which began September 1 are currently planned at $10 billion, an increase of 35% over the comparable fiscal year 2020 lettings. Updated Colorado DOT projections indicate relatively flat transportation spending levels for 2021 and North Carolina DOT which temporarily suspended awards for certain projects in response to pre-COVID-19 funding issues and other factors, recently revised its letting schedule upward and resume bidding for resurfacing work earlier this month. As a reminder, these three key states represent over 60% of our Building Materials business revenues. On the federal front, the President recently signed into law a continuing resolution that included a one-year extension at the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act at current funding levels which was consistent with our expectations. In our view, this provides state and local governments, the visibility needed to plan, design and let transportation projects through the 2021 construction season. Over the medium to long-term future, we expect the industry to benefit from the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal surface transportation package which we anticipate will be enacted by mid-2021. Both the United States House and Senate have advanced federal highway legislation, underscoring bipartisan support to remedy the nation's crumbling surface transportation infrastructure. Notably, both those provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15 years. Regardless of the upcoming election outcomes, increased infrastructure investment, it should provide volume stability and drive aggregates shipments closer to 45% of our total shipments moving us toward our 10-year historical average. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 38% of third quarter shipments. Although certain sectors of non-residential construction remained challenged in the near-term, COVID-19 is driving a paradigm shift that should promote more diverse non-residential demand from the previous cycle, fueling long-term aggregates growth. Accelerating technology, e-commerce and remote work trends require increased investment in heavy industrial warehouses and data centers which are generally more aggregates intensive than by commercial construction due to the size and scale of these projects. Importantly, we have purposefully shifted our non-residential exposure over the last 10 years or so to be more heavily industrially focused as we've expanded our geographic footprint along major commerce corridors. Additionally, light commercial construction, despite its current weak demand should benefit in the longer-term from the drag along effects of strong single-family residential trends. Aggregate shipments at the non-residential market accounted for 33% of third quarter shipments. Single-family housing is expected to lead this economic recovery as the organization accelerates. Prospective homebuyers are increasingly moving from large metropolitan cities to smaller metro or suburban areas with the pandemic. Recently, North Carolina, our third largest state by revenues, was identified as a top migration destination ranking number seven among states that experienced the most inbound moves from March through August of this year, according to data from United Van Lines. These trends extend beyond those moving from one state to another. They also include existing restaurants opting to move farther out from city centers. Across our Southeastern and Southwestern footprint, under those conditions and favorable population and unemployment dynamics provide Martin Marietta with a distinct competitive advantage for outsized secular growth in single-family housing development. Importantly, single-family housing is two to three times the aggregates intensity, but multi-family housing, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new suburban communities. Aggregate shipments to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter shipments. In summary, as our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, navigating challenging times and emerging from them stronger are hallmarks of our company. We've executed a thoughtful strategy and taken deliberate steps to position Martin Marietta as a resilient, efficient and cash flow generative business that can consistently drive shareholder value creation. We will continue to do what we do best. Manage our business safely and responsibly, ensuring that we're prepared to seize profitable growth opportunities for the benefit of our stakeholders. Martin Marietta remains well-positioned to capitalize on the emerging growth trends that are expected to support steady and sustainable construction activity over the long-term. With our attractive underlying fundamentals, strategic priorities and best in-class teams, we are excited about our bright prospects for driving long-term sustainable growth and shareholder value in the fourth quarter, in 2021 and well into the future. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Trey, thanks for the question. No, you are entirely right to put up these numbers, but as you said, North Carolina is not at peak of its game right now, we think it's going to be back to normal, by the way mid half year, next year, but what we've done in this very impressive quarter is done a good by arm and half tied behind our back because North Carolina is down, but it's not going to stay down. Then Magnesia Specialties is going through the foot moral right now, but it's not going to stay down either. So what you're seeing is really a two-fold impact Trey, one, pricing was very good and that's something that we come to expect and you come to expect as have our shareholders. So there are no surprises there. It's nice to see it performing in resilient fashion. Again, one of your closed down to double-digits on volume. But to your point, I think what we're really seeing, even separate and distinct from the energy piece of it, is very good cost performance and that's something that our team has been focused on, it's nothing that's new to Martin Marietta, you can see it also in the SG&A numbers. But if I go through and look at where we'll be not just in energy, but where we'll be relative to contract services, repairs, supplies, and other plant costs, all down, and that's exactly what we would anticipate. As you recall, Trey, we've gone through cycles. We tend to invest very carefully in our company. And when we were going through the financial crisis in the Great Recession, we did pull back on CapEx. At the same time in the last few years, we've taken CapEx up and that has truly been an investment in our business. So what we're seeing the benefits of is a better cost profile, operational excellence, cost performance across the spectrum that we would anticipate. And the other thing that's important, Trey, is the way that we've grown our business. So when we've added businesses as we have in Colorado and what we've done in Texas with TXI and what you're seeing from excess real estate sales and similarly, what we've done with Bluegrass, these have all been enhancing this organization, but it's truly aggregates led and you're seeing good performance come through on the cost side, which again is exactly what we would have expected. And the thing that I've really enjoyed and I am so grateful with this team on is continuing to show their agility and being able to manage that on the fly and as they would need. We're always going to remember 2020 as the year that could have been, because if you're seeing this type of performance with volumes down, you can imagine what I believe we'd be doing this year if we were not in the midst of the pandemic. Trey, that's another great question. I would say several things. I would think in the back half, which is certainly big calling towards volume growth. I mean, here we are in Q3, which is the single largest quarter for the industry, it's the largest quarter for Martin Marietta, and we're down 9%. So, I would expect, in half through next year, we are seeing growth. Keep in mind, half - quarter one is really a rather inconsequential quarter. There is very little volume that goes in Q1. The season really begins in earnest for a business like ours in May because that's when you'll have everything open across an enterprise including those parts of the country, it tend to be more weather-affected. So what I say on a comparative basis, Q1 would be a tough compare, yes, but it's not going to be huge tonnage. As a practical matter, the pandemic really started settling in as we went into Q2. But I would think, when we get to the back half of next year we should start to see the economy grow in some ways. I do think the deurbanization trends that we're seeing, will help us nicely on housing. I think Martin Marietta is going to be a very nice beneficiary of that because you saw the data that I revealed even on North Carolina relative to United Van Lines data, but that same data is true for Georgia, and it's true for Florida, and it's true for Texas, and it's true for Colorado. And again, when we start going through those impacts states, it matters. I think that's something that's real, and we're going launch we go into 2021. The other thing that I would say relative to 2021, Trey, is infrastructure looks a lot better today than we thought, infrastructure was going to look when we were half year. So, if we look back at even for a tech stocks, so they were going to be at half year as they were thinking about 2021. They were $7.5 billion, so they've got a 10 handle in front of that today. We're looking at a state like Colorado, they're saying it's going to be relatively flat, and we know our third largest state by revenue in North Carolina is going to be better, when we get into the second half of the calendar year of 2021. Remember these states work on fiscal years that in large part end on June 30. I think the end use that's going to be the one that we need to watch most carefully is not a surprise to anyone, it's going to be non-residential. And I think you're going to have a tale of two different stories in non-res. I think the heavy side of it, Trey, is going to be pretty good. I mean, I'll give you a sense of it. In the Greater San Antonio area all by itself right now, we are bidding on right for six different Amazon fulfillment centers just in that marketplace. So, we're looking at heavy side non-res in states where we have very intentionally built our business. We think that's going to look attractive. So whether it's data warehousing, warehousing or otherwise, we think that's going to be good. And I do think hospitality is going to be challenged for a while. I think vary degrees of energy on a comparative basis are going to be challenged for a little while and I think office and retail will as well. But here's what I would say, if the housing trends continued the way that we believe that they will, and we believe it's going to be more single-family driven, we're going to see homebuilders buying more land, we're going to see them entitling that land and we're going to see the drag along effect hopefully not in '21 but probably more going into '22 of the light portion of non-res. So what I'll try to do Trey, in response to your question is, go through those three primary end users that we have and speak to at least what we're seeing relative to trends right now. Obviously, when we come out with our full year results in February, then you get the more precise guidance. We'll get much more granularity to that, but again my commentary saying that this October compared to last October looks pretty good. We like that as a data point. No, look, you're right, it's been an unusual year but at the same time, what I'd say Kathryn is, pricing, if we're really looking cement segments it's up 3.4%. So pricing in cement, in Texas is behaving like aggregates. And keep in mind, that's something that we've long said we thought it would be the case. If we look at our cement backlogs, I'll tell you that that's one of the great stories because we're seeing cement backlogs up 24% on strong infrastructure bookings and primarily a large job that Tesla has going on in the Austin area and some property that we sold them. So the backlog situation looks quite good there. And actually the pricing was pretty good, Kathryn. If you look at it, the optics, the pricing and the reality of them are two very different things. Because the reality is, energy sector sales for us, which are not a big amount of tons were down 74% in West Texas. So a big percentage, but small tons. But the reason that's so important and we call it out in the prepared comments, that's where that cement sales were over $200 a ton. So if we're coming back and just looking at Type 1 and Type 2 cement in San Antonio and in Dallas, those numbers are actually up very nicely, and we think that that's likely what we're going to see next year as well. Now, in fairness, we have said that we're going to take cement pricing up in April of next year and we have a letter out to that effect right now and we're talking about $9 in that Texas marketplace next year. So I think that gives you a sense of how pricing has behaved this year, what has been the mix effect on it, what this Type 1 and Type 2 look like. The other thing that I'll note Kathryn, because this is important too, is we have continued to see efficiency improvement quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year in our cement business. So kind of what I would call out for you is volume is down, but the cement EBITDA in Q3, the margin of 46.2%, represents actually a new quarterly record. So we're getting it both ways, we're doing it the hard way on costs, but we're doing it the other way on pricing as well, but again backlogs up 23%. We're a little bit over 270,000 tons. Sure. Happy to, couple of things. One, Texas, I'll just go through them in order of revenues. So Texas has huge FY '20, '21 lettings of $10.2 billion, we spoke about that just a minute ago. That's going to have a multi-year benefit to Martin Marietta. Our backlogs in that state are up in all three product lines and we see some very large projects coming in 2021. What's important to our members across seven funding is currently projected at a full $2.5 billion, even as we're looking at cropped one that's looking at $620 million. And keep in mind, none of that anticipates Texas having to tap into their $10 billion rainy day funds. So again, Texas feels very healthy even compared to where we were half year. Colorado looks pretty flattish and that's what we are expecting. We see construction activity there that's being supported by about a $1.8 billion four-year bond program. Two years remain on that and that could provide an additional $1 billion or more. So we're feeling good about where that state is, again, a nice improvement over where it was at half year. The North Carolina DOT situation that you called out very specifically and appropriately is improving. And part of what we've seen even in the last week is North Carolina mail is sending out some double A-rated bonds, they were just rated last week. It's going to be $700 million of build North Carolina bonds. And importantly, the state has started - what we started lettings and anticipates about $1.3 billion of it - of FY '21 lettings and that's pretty similar to the pre-pandemic numbers of about $1.4 billion. So again, we're feeling much better about North Carolina and that's one that we obviously stay very close to. Similarly, you asked about Georgia and we're anticipating there relatively flat DOT spending at about $2 billion. But part of what we think is important is it appears that Georgia is going to advance at least two of the major mobility projects in Atlanta. They're not going to have a '21 start, but they're likely to have a '22 start. And remember, these are major mobility projects at about $12 billion and their primary aim is to reduce congestion along key corridors in Georgia. And the last one, at least in our top five is Florida DOT, and again, we're looking at something there that we think is going to be very steady year-over-year. Keep in mind, they've got a very healthy P3 program in that state, so you've got a lot of activity in Florida. So again, if we look at our top five states and that's exactly what I've just taken you through from an infrastructure perspective, year-over-year, we like the looks of that. Paul, thanks for the question. It's good to hear your voice. Yes, I would say that we are one of the few industries that probably can't lose next week and here's what I mean by that. If the President is re-elected, we anticipate there is going to be a new highway bill and we think it's probably going to be up very similar to the Senate's number, that's 28% over FAST Act and that being the largest increase all by itself in 15 years. Similarly, if we should have a change in part of the White House and Mr. Biden is elected and the fact is, the democratic-controlled House is looking at a 41% increase in highway spending. So here's what I would say, if the President's re-elected, it's going up and it's going up with less regulation. If Mr. Biden is elected, it's going up with probably more regulation. And the irony of that is, we actually do pretty well with regulation. Well, we've got great teams, they are very sophisticated, they can deal with that very efficiently. So we - I believe, either way, Martin Marietta will be well-positioned. If there is more regulation, one of the things that we certainly see that drive in the past is perhaps more M&A opportunity as well, because often times, if you're looking at a higher tax, higher regulatory environment, closely-held kind of businesses start reconsidering what their long-term future is as well. So, as we sit here and anticipate what different outcomes could be, it can change the way that we're going to think about some things around the margin, but in large measure, we think under either one of those scenarios, Martin Marietta does very well. Well, I would say a couple of things. One, volume will always be this industry's friend because you're going to have a certain degree of cost, but as much as we'd like to be at a flex costs as much as we can, some of them are going to be fixed, it's a big heavy industry, but I think we control cost extraordinarily well. Again, I think geography, from a mixed perspective, actually this quarter, was not particularly upper end. So, if we see these Eastern markets behaving in a more robust fashion and volume hits those markets, it could be pretty impressive relative to margin. Keep in mind, in the East this year, we saw a significant project delays and we saw extremely wet weather in what was formerly the Mid-Atlantic Division. And again, we've discussed the fact that we saw lower NCDOT funding, that's going to be remedy, and we saw most win part activity. So, if we look at that didn't happen in the East and things that we don't think will continue to recur into the future, we think that's probably very attractive for our margins. The other thing that I would say is I would not expect the cost that we have been very good at controlling this year to go backwards on us. I think the investments that we have made on capital will be our friend. Now in fairness, there is a piece of that that's tied up in energy and there are a lot of things we can control. I wish, I could tell you that we could control overall energy prices, but we can't, but at the same time, as energy has tended to move upward, keep in mind, that's also served historically as the mechanism plus to make sure that we can cover that with increased average selling prices as well. So, I do think relative to margins, geography is likely to be more of a friend, they are not going forward, and I think this is the type of cost performance that you should expect us to continue to deliver. No, you did, Jerry. I guess what I would say is that, I'm not sure if there was anything strikingly new about the observations I was making on '21. I think the primary thing that I just want to underscore is that pricing is something that we tend to do really well in Martin Marietta. When volumes go up, pricing goes up, when volumes go down, pricing still goes up. And in this quarter I thought it was pretty good, because there are not a lot of industries that could come forward with volume down line and pricing up the way that we saw pricing up this year. So I think that's the underlying theme that I want to make sure that I underscore. I think the other thing to remember, Jerry, is we're seeing that as we pointed out in some of the conversations we've had, with actually one of our higher-priced - higher profitable businesses not at the top of their game this year, because of what's not coming out of NCDOT. So again, I think we'll continue to see a good price trajectory in large part because we're in many good locations. And I think as we continue to see superfamily housing go up, that's actually an area that we tend to do quite well in housing on, because if you're thinking about people who will at least try to utilize some form of volume, on occasion, as a lever to talk to you about pricing, that's typically not the home door, because at the end of the day, there is so many things they care deeply about in the home, but the news flash is the price of crushed stone usually is not one of them. So I think if we end up seeing a new highway bill, we see the volume that we think will come from that, probably not in '21, but as practical matter coming in '22, but we see a very healthy residential market and then we see the drag along in the growth of time of the like non-res. I think all of that pretends very well for pricing. And again, if we look at those top five states that are disproportionately important to us and you look at even what's happened with cement pricing in Texas, I think that tells you that the overall marketplace is at a pretty healthy spot. Well, and again, we'll give you even more granularity around that when we come out in February, because some of those conversations are still ongoing. But again, I think you get the overall sense that there is nothing in our pricing model that we feel like has been shaken by this strange time to the world navigating together. Yes, Anthony, thank you for the question. I think part of it is - you could deepen up into something that strange and you start to figure it out a little bit. So, I think candidly, that's part of it. The other - another part of it is, Anthony, there is just not that much runway left this year and we've got a pretty good sense of how October is looking. Obviously, Q4 itself can have some swing factors to it, and obviously one of them is, when does weather really set in earnest. It's been interesting Anthony, because there have been years that we have been paving almost up to Christmas in Colorado and equally, there have been years that well before Thanksgiving, it was shut down. So, obviously, we'll try to bracket but we think Q4 can like from just a volume perspective, we know what it's going to look like from a pricing perspective. And we believe we've got a pretty good handle on what it's going to look like from a cost perspective as well. So, I think those were the factors candidly that went into it and again in the conversation that I was having just a few minutes ago with Jerry and others on the end users. We're trying to get as - we are just taking a look into '21 as we can, but again, we feel pretty good about all of them. Yes, I would say several things. One, we see deferrals, we don't see cancellations and I think that's an important bifurcation to draw, because pushing projects to the right is an entirely different animal than calling them off. So during the financial crisis in the Great Recession, we saw projects cancel, that's not what we're seeing. So I want to call that. The other is, in some instances, we simply saw weather deferrals. So obviously, we've had some hurricanes that have come in through the Southwest this year and we've had a good bit of rain in the Southeast. But the primary place that, again, I think we're taking some good comfort is when we're seeing North Carolina DOT start re-letting some surface transportation again, in some respects for the first time in almost a year. So when we see that state beginning to return to something that feels more like in a patience, a normal start as rhythm, that certainly feels better to us. So we're - we did not see anything relative to deferrals in the quarter that we thought were extraordinary or surprised us. And in many respects, what I would say is from a volume perspective, I don't think we're very surprised this quarter. I think from a pricing perspective, we were not surprised. And I'm not going to tell you that from a cost perspective we were surprised, I would tell you, gratified, is probably the right word, but again, we expect to see more of that going into the future, not less up. Stanley, that's a great question. And what I think is this, one, they're busy and busy usually begets busy. And number two, I do think the shift that we're seeing in the Great American move - moving more away from multifamily, moving to single-family where people frankly want some space but they haven't had for the last several years is going to lead to the necessity of buying more land. And by the way, we don't think that's a bad thing. We actually think that's a good thing, because if we look at the markets in which we are operating one, they tend to have land, two, the entitlement for new subdivisions isn't something that's highly difficult to do, and three, the ability to borrow money is there. So we feel like all of that's important. The other piece of it, Stanley, that we think is important is these markets are not overbuilt and that's such a fundamentally different place. And part of what we spoke about in the half-year call is, we've seen single-family move around over the last couple of decades. So single-family recovery is, we're really looking at coming out with the great financial crisis. So also about 70% of starts versus what had typically been closer to 80%. So if we're seeing it move back to a more of a normalized portion of what we would expect single-family to be, particularly as we're looking at these deurbanization trends, that is we're looking at states in which we have a significant presence, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida. Those are going to be cities and those are going to be states that would be grown out, not states that will be growing up and places that are growing out tend to be more aggregates intensive. So yes, I think our builders are busy. Yes, I think they will have to buy more land. I think they will be in the entitlement business but I think in the areas where we are the entitlements, would not end up being significant, I'll have to use your word, I think it's a good one, a governor, on what housing growth is going to look like. Stanley, that's a great question and you're right, we're at the low end of our range. So our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is at two times today. You've seen that steadily come down and I'm proud of the way that we pulled that down. As you know, our capital priorities have not changed. And our capital priorities are to find the right acquisition. We think there may be some opportunities in 2021 that we're certainly looking at, the deal pipeline has become more active here over the last few months and that does not surprise us. And equally, the other thing that we're waiting to watch and everybody else in this call is too, what happens in the election? And it will be odd. For example, if we do see a wider new streak go to the United States and we see a higher regulatory regime come in, as I indicated earlier, we have certainly seen that as something that they can serve as a bit of a catalyst for M&A activity as well. So I think we want to make sure that we keep ourselves in a very flexible spot. Obviously, it's in management's discretion whether we go in and turn back on the repurchases, we will certainly look at that and think through it carefully. You did see us - as Jim commented in his opening comments, we raised our dividend in September, so our September shareholders have already benefited from that. So I like where we sit from a balance sheet perspective, but equally Stanley, and I think this is important as we think about M&A, I like where we sit from a regulatory perspective as well. The areas the country where we would be most interested in growing particularly if we're looking to establish new footprints. We've got a lot of white space and we have a lot of regulatory ability, from a Hart-Scott-Rodino perspective. And I think our teams have proven that they are very good at one, identifying transactions, number two, going through the process of memorializing it and then upon closing, pulling the synergy side of it as well. So we're going to find good uses for that cash, whether it's investing in Martin Marietta, returning to shareholders or finding right deal, but you know how we rank those in order, Stanley. Absolutely, Stanley. Stanley, as you recall, historically, non-res would have been around 30% of our business and then over the last several quarters, you've seen it actually considerably more than that, it's closer to the mid-30s. And you'll recall historically, this was really when I give you this background. This is pre-TXI, this is pre river for the Rocky's, this is pre-Bluegrass. We would have said, it's almost a 50-50 break between light on one hand and heavy on the other. As we've done these large transactions, as we come out of the river, as we have focused our business increasingly on these large commerce corridors, we feel like it - now the heavy side of it is probably at least 60%. So it's probably moved that much just as we've done these transactions. And it's interesting to go back and revisit that number I gave just a few minutes ago, even talking about the fact that in the San Antonio area right now, we're bidding on seven Amazon warehouses data center projects at various stages of bidding. So the locations where we've been, whether it's on the I-25 corridor, whether it's on the I-35 corridor, whether it's on the l-85 corridor or the l-95 corridor has really helped move that. And if you think about those corridor, l-95 was significantly changed by Bluegrass. I-85 was significantly changed about what we did with the assets that we acquired in Atlanta. l-35 was significantly changed by what we did with TXI and I-25 was completely remade with what we did in the River for the River - I mean River for the Rocky swap. So the percentage shift is probably 60%, 40% today but again, non-res has moved to a bigger piece of the pie in large measure, because infrastructure has underperformed as we've gone through a series of re-authorizations that unlike next year, has not gone up in value over the last 15 years. Yes. Yes, I think several things probably. One, we don't have some things going on this year that we had going on last year. They were actually varying degrees of headwinds last year. So if you go back to it, part of what you'll see is, we did have some increased grading last year we're stripping employees, we did accelerate some maintenance at our Hunter Cement Plant. And our Granite Canyon quarry which sits in Southern Miami, which feeds that very vibrant Northern Colorado market was later coming on last year, then we would have hoped. And then Hurricane Dorian sided with Freeport Bahamas last year, a little bit longer that we would have wished though. Number one, they actually put some headwinds in Q4 last year and we're thinking we're probably past some of that this year, but equally, I think the October trends are nice. I think part of what we're seeing is some of the work, particularly in Central Texas as Tesla is building their bigger factory on the property that we sold them, that certainly add some benefits. And again, if we see something that feels like a normal winter cadence, we're very comfortable with what we feel like would be the midpoint of that range. So it - that at least gives you a sense of what the puts and takes would be in the little bit of the year that's left. I hope that's helpful. Yes. Yes. No, Yes, I think they can, because part of what's happened, Phil is, if we go back over time, several things. If you look at the way different states came out of the financial crisis, some states ended up hiring more people in DOTs, Texas is a good example. Some states started doing more outsourcing, North Carolina is a good example, which means at least as we're sitting here today, they have more projects that are engineered the designed, right-of-way has been purchased and they're in a position if they want to go that they can. And I think that's a very fundamentally different place. So to your point, if there is a pace for or if there is anything else and there is simply as you know, AASHTO has long been advocating for about $37 billion that they feel like should go roughly to states to help fill the hole that was created because yes, tax revenues weren't there. Now keep in mind, early in the year, they said that hole is going to be $50 billion, so that hole got a lot narrower or - not as deep over time. But to your point, if that money went directly to NCDOT, do they have plenty of uses for today? Absolutely. It's weather floating $400 million worth of bonds, could Texas do the same thing? To be sure, and could Colorado do the same thing? Absolutely, because again if you look at that state they are metering out there buying activity over time and that can simply come in and help augment that. So I do think your point's a good one, because most of what we've been discussing to date has been around the reauthorized bill and what the timing would look like on that. And again, we're saying passage in '21, but the real event from a tonnage is probably '22. But I do think if you've got some near-term stimulus that could actually be at '21 about. Yes, that, I - we'll obviously give you some really good guidance on that in February, but I think part of what we're trying to outline bill is, this is a really impressive quarter with volumes down almost double-digits and our most profitable business with its arm tied behind its back. So again, our backlogs, for example, in Texas look very good. So I think we can feel good about where that business is heading into '21. Obviously NCDOT is letting some jobs. I think we've been increasingly good about that. If the Eastern business gets some momentum going into '21 even in the back half, so that's where your story would be. Yes, that wouldn't surprise me. And again we'll come out with more granular information in February. But if we think about it, Seldon, this is the big quarter and keep in mind, this was a big quarter last year. So this was the beast of compares. And it's always interesting to look at how percentages can work in Q1, but I would suggest you percentages in Q1 helped me a lot because the tonnage is so slow. So it would not surprise me but this on a percentage down, unless we see things just changed dramatically. It would not surprise me that this would be your states single steepest client, to use your words. Yes. I guess... Yes. I guess the way we think of it, if we look at the states in which we see significant population trends and then that's going to be our top five states, where there will be capacity needs and capacity issue. So if you take that Georgia mobility program and think about that in more than just an Atlanta contracts and you think about the Atlanta, but you think also about Columbia, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida and Orlando and Raleigh and Charlotte, and then you start looking at 9 miles added. That's your single most aggregates intensive undertake because several things happen. So then it's taking a lot of tonnage, but it's taking a lot of vary tonnage as well. So you are you putting based products down, you are venture to put in clean stone and either asphalt or concrete and that's going down. So you're taking the entire way of more products. So number one, that's actually very healthy for inventories. Number two, it's actually very healthy for the way that we can run our business. Now can you take a crushing plant, hold it in some degree and produce less space and more clean stone so we - but I mean it's not a science and doing that because it's not that easy, but as a practical matter, if you've got a wider array of products going out that will intend to be the case, if you have a new highway bill and you've got capacity that is being added in states. What that does from an operating efficiency and what it does from an inventory efficiency is incredibly helpful. And part of that we've seen over the last several years is what would appear to be a fairly significant outperformance in non-residential. And what I would tell you is non-residential has actually been quite good but non-residential hasn't been really on fire. It's really that the public side of it has been slower than it should have been. So if we see more infrastructure go, it's high spec material, it's a material that we can deliver and we think of these states in which we're operating as they add needed capacity, it adds tonnage and it adds efficiency. I hope that helpful. No, I would say several things, one, we saw good price in Colorado and we saw some mix shifts in Texas. So I think that's largely what you see. And look, the other piece of it is, hey, the concrete business paid more for aggregates and the concrete business paid more for cement and that's okay from where we sit, because we're providing most of the aggregates and we're providing most of the cement and so that's a lot of what was going on there. But really, if you look at it, nice 2.2% per ton better on ASP. So a lot of good things that we're seeing in ready-mix right now, but in large measure, it helps undergo a very attractive upstream business, so it's doing exactly what we would have thought. Well, service and rail has been reasonably good and it's really not so much Houston, it's really more South Texas when you get down to the pure LNG projects that are - or even closer to the water. And that was really a piece of the mix issues in the Southwest, because if we had fewer tons coming out of those yards, as you know those tons are transportation loaded, David, so that was really the big shift there. So it wasn't as much of our Houston metro per se issue because there is some very good projects going on in Houston, including the Grand Parkway. And for example, we've seen a good amount of cement go to that and as you may recall that, actually cement is modestly lower priced in San Antonio than it is in Dallas and things are going to the Grand Parkway are really coming out of Hunter facility. So we're not seeing bad activity in Houston, whatsoever, it was really more cost to oriented on that commentary. Look, I'll certainly time and if we're looking at South Carolina, they're going to FY 2021 program would buy $1.8 billion, that's up about 15%, so we like what we're seeing there. The South Carolina did something the other year that was very on South Carolina of them and that is they raise the gas tax. So they are taking that up incrementally over a period of six years. We're about halfway through that, so we're seeing good activity there. All of that, we're really Arkansas passed a 10-year $10 billion funding plan so that basically doubles their funding over $8 billion over a 10-year plan and we like where we see that business going. Keeping in mind, we've got a very attractive business in and around Arkansas City and we're seeing good activity at the airport there as well. Our business in Indiana, just to be clear, we call it our Indiana district that we have historically, it's really our Indianapolis district and what we've seen in that business and the leadership there has just done a superb job of controlling costs exceptionally well. I mean they really do deserve a call out on that, but they equally done very well and making sure we're getting good recognition on pricing on what we're doing in that marketplace. I think Indiana is looking quite strong. If I'm looking questions just to be completely open book with you on where we've seen more difficulty this year, it's been in places like Kentucky and portions of Savina Hill. Kentucky DOT has not had its finest moment this year and I think equally you've heard that from others is they have gone through, I think you would have heard a bit of that from Summit and its commentary earlier in the week as well. But if we're looking at places like Maryland, and we're looking at Virginia, and Iowa, in Nebraska, and as going through those, just give you a sense of it, Michael, that does round out our top 10 states which is going to be 85% of our revenue. They're not things that we feel like are troubling to us as we looked at Maryland, Virginia, Iowa, or Nebraska right now, again, Maryland has a very significant T3 program, and the other states just tend to be very solid states. Remember, Iowa consume on average more stone per capita than any place else because they go through a hard place sale cycle each year and it's a big farm to market economy, but equally that's been an economy that has been served quite well by what's happening relative to data warehousing. So we've seen Microsoft and Amazon and others, not just build warehousing but Phases 2 or Phases 3 and sometimes Phases 4 of that, so that's actually been quite good. The one area in the Midwest that has been more challenging this year has been plus not happened relative to wind energy and we call that out on some of the commentary that we had just breaking down between business in our East Group and business in our West Group, but hopefully that was responsive to taking a little bit deeper dive in the bottom five. That's would what we give for. Take care, Michael. No, no, happy to. I mean, it's interesting, but are different pricing is always a little bit challenging at least in half, outlook and pricing in Colorado tends to be very attractive pricing, outlook on pricing in Texas continues to look pretty steady. I would tell you is we look at backlogs year-over-year, there are 3% and if you're looking at a very dynamic market I like the way that works. So, again part of what we've done in Texas in particular item is, we've moved a certain degree of our volume in Texas from infrastructure, in some instances to housing and I will tell you very candidly, why we did it, we wanted to have it and a little bit more of that in housing, one, because housing look good; and two, housing does not tend to be as weather-sensitive it's infrastructure as. Now that said, housing tends to have a little bit lower ASPs. So we're picking and choosing very much by design there, but again we think pricing will be solid and we think backlogs in that business right now are actually up in the Southwest. Adrian, it's always a journey, it's like safety, we never think we're done. And what I would say if we go back and look at the way things have worked. One of the best examples I can give you is Maryland and we were talking about just a moment ago with Michael, what some of the states look like that were not in our top five and I spoke, specifically the Maryland. And then what's interesting to me on that, Adrian, is Maryland for us in the Bluegrass transaction was not necessarily a consolidation play. We had a couple of facilities in that state there in the western part of the state, and most of what we acquired Bluegrass there was in Maryland, who was really more in Baltimore metro. And what we brought to that is a discipline and we brought to it a sense of not being ashamed to make sure we are getting the right value for a product that we're making that needs, state and federal specifications, and that we think it's not easy to do. And keeping in mind that, on the infrastructure side, stone is about 10% of the cost of building road, on the housing side, it's about 2% of the cost of a home and if we look at non-residential at somewhere between those two numbers. In other words, our product is never going to be, but it's going to make or break whether the project goes or not. Equally, our product isn't going to make or break whether that contractors typically low or not, but at the same time to do what we do with the scale that we do and do it as safely as we do. We want to make sure we're getting good value for something that's a depleting resource. Now that said, if we look on average at today's rates of taking start on the ground, we've got a century with reserves left. So we don't have an issue of the stone going away, but in a world that we think will continue to have higher regulatory barriers and burdens to entry, making sure we're getting value for this product is important. I will tell you, equally, you can see what our average selling prices and it's going to be in the low teens, right now, but there are plenty of markets in the United States where we're selling aggregates for numbers that have a two in front of it and we don't see those higher numbers having any degree of chilling effect on construction in those markets. So this has been an area for our company that has been one of strength for a long time. Back to my point, this continues to be a journey. I think it's going to be an area of strength for years yet to come, Adrian. Thank you all for joining our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Moving forward, we are confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of strong financial, safety and operational performance and remain focused on maximizing value for all shareholders. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy."

            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to all. For the third quarter, the Building Materials business delivered products and services revenues of $1.2 billion, a 6% decrease from the prior year period and product gross profit of $384 million, a 3% decrease. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 130 basis point to 36.4% an all-time record despite lower shipment volume. Strong mix adjusted pricing gains, disciplined cost management and lower diesel fuel costs contributed to 6.5% growth in aggregates unit profitability. These results demonstrate the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregates-led business. Cement product gross margin was 40.2%, a 40 basis point decline. Despite lower revenues, the Cement business benefited from lower fuel cost and prior year tail investments that have improved reliability and throughput. For our downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete product gross margin declined 90 basis, 9.7% attributable, the higher cost to raw material. Asphalt and paving achieved record gross profit of $32 million and a 140 basis point improvement margin despite lower revenue. Magnesia Specialties third quarter product revenues decreased 7% to $55 million reflecting lower demand for chemicals and lime products. So revenues and reduced fixed cost absorption resulted in a 240 basis point decline and product gross margin to 38%. Our consolidated results included $70 million of gains on surplus from non-core land sales and divested assets. These gains, which were recorded in other operating income net are non-recurring and should not be extrapolated in a run-rate calculation. As a reminder, surplus land sales were part of the value proposition of our TXI acquisition and that's exactly what you see in this quarter. Since 2016, we have sold nearly $200 million of excess land that was not used for operations and did not contain operating assets. While we cannot predict the timing of any future land sales, we expect additional non-core real estate divestitures as favorable opportunities develop. We achieved the highest adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history, both inclusive and exclusive of the previously discussed non-recurring gains. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion inclusive of the $7 million non-recurring gains for full year 2020. Now, turning to capital allocation and liquidity. We continue to balance our longstanding disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value-enhancing acquisitions and prudent organic capital investment and a consistent return of capital to shareholders while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. In August, we acquired an aggregates and ready-mix concrete company in Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. These acquired operations complement our existing geographic footprint and expand our customer base. We also enhance our aggregates and cement throughput to drive incremental upstream value. We have widened our full year capital expenditures guidance and now expect it to range from $350 million to $400 million. We are exploring additional lifetime exchange opportunities that was defer the taxes we would otherwise pay on this year's sizable land sales. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases in meaningful, sustainable dividend. Our Board of Directors recently approved a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its continued confidence in our future performance and cash generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.28. Share repurchase activity remain temporary pause during the quarter. However, repurchases can resume at management's discretion. With a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2 times, we were at the lower end of our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times. We remain confident in our balance sheet strength with $1.2 billion total liquidity. With our low leverage and ample liquidity, we retain the financial flexibility to continue to profitably grow our business. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward for his market trends commentary and preliminary outlooks for 2021."

My name is Kevin, I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta\u2019s, Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder today\u2019s discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q2 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Today\u2019s earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, whose remarks will focus on second quarter operating performance as well as current and emerging market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and liquidity position, and Ward will then provide some closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow our prepared remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today\u2019s teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families are remaining safe and healthy as we continue to manage through these unprecedented times. As highlighted in this earnings released Martin Marietta delivered outstanding operational financial and safety performance, not withstanding some localized weather headwinds in the quarter and the broader uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. This performance is a testament to our company\u2019s commitment to our values, the world-class attributes of our business and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Martin Marietta established few profitability records for both the second quarter and the first half of the year driven by favorable pricing and proactive cost management across the building materials business, for the second quarter specifically consolidated gross margin expanded 200 basis points despite slightly lower revenues as compared with the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved 10 basis points to 5.6%. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 7.5% to $407 million and fully diluted earnings per share was $3.49, a 16% improvement. An addition to record financial performance and despite the challenging conditions, we also achieved the best safety performance in our history, companywide both our lost time and total entry, instant rates are better than world class safety levels. These superior results are directly attributable to our dedicated and talented employees who have continued to demonstrate resiliency during these uncertain times. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team has adapted to our new health protocols, while remaining steadfastly focused on caring for one another safely and efficiently and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders needs. Martin Marietta along with many of our customers has operated as a designated essential business during the COVID-19 shutdowns and subsequent phases which did experienced impact from a macro economic slowdown. Despite these challenges, second quarter product demand for building materials business remains strong across a number of our key geographies, including North Texas and the Front Range of Colorado, two of our leading vertically integrated markets. Contractors continued construction on projects already underway and have in some instances benefited from jobs that were accelerated to better leverage lower traffic volumes during shelter in place orders and new projects. In addition, we saw aggregate shipments growth in Georgia and Florida, despite above average rainfall in these states during the quarter and in Indiana. Overall quarterly aggregate shipments declined approximately 4% compared within the record prior your period volume. As reminder, our second quarter 2019 results benefited from blended deferred carryover work, sizeable energy sector projects and Midwest flooding repair activity. Aggregates pricing improved 3.3%. All divisions contributed to this growth underscoring the health of our markets and the importance of our locally driven pricing strategy. By region, the West group posted a 5.5% increase, reflecting favorable product mix. Pricing for the Mid-America Group improved 2% essential division, which is selling prices below the corporate average contributed a higher percentage of the Mid-America Group shipments consistent with the first quarter trends. Product mix limited Southeast Group pricing growth as a higher percentage of lower priced files and base stone were shipped.  Underlying demand for our Texas base cement business remains largely stable. However, second quarter cement shipments decreased 3% driven primarily by the decline in energy sector activity that has resulted from lower oil prices. West Texas oil wells cement shipments were down over 75% from pre-COVID expectations, a trend expected to continue until oil prices stabilize at a level that fosters additional investment in drilling activity in the Permian Basin. Throughout the quarter, we saw attractive and consistent pricing strength in our North and Central Texas cement operations. Specifically, cement prices in Dallas and San Antonio, the markets most proximate to our Midlothian and Hunter facilities were up 4%. That said notably lower shipments of higher priced oil wells specialty cement products down for West Texas limited overall price and growth. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, the readymix concrete shipments increased nearly 9% excluding prior year shipments from our southwest readymix divisions Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas business known generally as ArkLaTex, which we divested earlier this year. Overall, concrete pricing increased modestly, but was hindered by unfavorable product mix. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business establish a new quarterly record for asphalt shipments. Shipments increased 35% to 1.1 million tons, benefiting from market strength and pent up demand following a weather challenge 2019. Asphalt pricing declined 1% as customer segmentation was weighted more heavily toward publicly bid municipal projects, as opposed to negotiated private work. The company\u2019s Magnesia Specialties business experienced most pronounced COVID-19 headwinds during the second quarter, domestic and international chemicals demand declined as customers confronted COVID-19 related disruptions. Demand for a lime and periclase products also slowed significantly as steel producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19 induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers. Before discussing near-term and emerging trends. I will now turn the call over to Jim for review of our second quarter financial results and liquidity. Jim.\nJames Nickolas: Thank you, Howard and good morning to everyone. It is worth highlighting that the enterprise achieved a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. This is the highest EBITDA margin in the company\u2019s history. The driving force behind this accomplishment was the building materials, which achieved record second quarter products and service revenues of $1.1 billion, a 1% increase from the prior year quarter and gross profit of $359 million a 9% increase. Notably, all of our building materials product lines contributed to this record profitability. Solid pricing gains, production efficiencies and lower diesel fuel costs drove a 230 basis point improvement in aggregate product gross margin to 35.5% also an all time record. This was accomplished despite lower volumes, demonstrating the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregate led business. Our Texas cement operations benefited from improved kiln reliability, as well as lower raw material and fuel costs. Product gross margin of 39.7% expanded 210 basis points despite a nearly 3% decline in cement revenues. As we have mentioned, our targeted downstream businesses delivered outstanding operational performance during the quarter. Readymix concrete product gross margin improved 270 basis points to 10.6% driven by increased shipments, pricing improvements and lower delivery costs. Equally impressive, our Colorado asphalt and paving business established second quarter records both revenues and gross profit. Product revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business decreased 31% to $49 million, reflecting lower demand for chemicals and lime products. Lower revenues resulted in a 420 basis point reduction of product gross margin to 37.3% or we expect this business will face similar headwinds in the third quarter. A gross margin in the high-30s is in practice, and indicative of superb cost management. Consolidated SG&A expenses included $3 million for COVID-19 related expenses, which included enhancements to cleaning and safety protocols across our over 400 sites. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. We continue to balance our long standing disciplined, capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet, and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and consistently return of capital to shareholders, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. Furthermore, capital expenditures are now expected in a range of $350 million to $375 million. A slight upward revision from the guidance provided last quarter, as U.S. businesses were in the early stages of responding to the pandemic. Our current priorities projects are expected to improve efficiencies, capacity and safety, all core principles in the foundation of a strong financial performance. While we typically invest in the business. We also look for appropriate opportunities to divest non-operating assets to maximize value. In this regard, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to sell 82 [indiscernible] location in Austin, Texas for nearly $100 million. Since our repurchase authorization was announced in February, 2015, we have returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of shared purchases and meaningful sustainment dividends. Share repurchases activity remains temporarily paused during the quarter. However, the purchases can resume at management\u2019s discretion. In May we repaid $300 million of floating rate notes that matured using proceeds for our first quarter bond issuance. The company has no additional bond maturity until July, 2024. We are confident in our balance sheet strengths, we have ample liquidity and financial flexibility to continue possibly growing our business. Net cash combined the nearly $970 million available on our existing developments facilities provided total liquidity of $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. Additionally, at a net debt EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times we renamed well within our target leverage range as of the end of the second quarter. With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard for his market trends commentary.\nHoward Nye: Thanks, Jim, with the successful completion of an outstanding first half of 2020, we remain laser focused on managing our business through the macroeconomic upheaval from COVID-19 and related governmental responses. While in July product demand and pricing trends across our markets remain broadly consistent with second quarter, we feel it is premature to reinstate full-year 2020 earnings guidance given the uncertainty regarding the pandemic, potential phrase for stimulus and infrastructure reauthorization. Nonetheless, we remain highly confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business guided by our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan. We expect pricing resiliency and disciplined cost management to continue supporting the company\u2019s near-term performance. As the economy resets from COVID-19, we believe favorable pricing trends for our products will continue supported by disciplined locally driven pricing strategy and attractive geographic footprint. For aggregates specifically, we anticipate full-year 2020 pricing will increase 3% to 4% from the prior year. This range is slightly below our pre COVID-19 expectations given year-over-year geographic and product mix trends and slightly delayed price increases in certain markets. Texas cement pricing is also expected to remain resilient due to the state\u2019s tight supply demand dynamics. And the fact that our team markets are by design largely insulated from waterborne imports. Healthy aggregates in cement pricing trends should benefit our targeted downstream operations. Existing customer backlogs support the company\u2019s shipment levels in the near-term and certain regions where we operate, this year\u2019s weather has been more disruptive of construction activity and project cadence, than the pandemic. Yet we believe the industry will likely see a gradual, but not precipitous temporary slowing in product demand over the next few quarters as businesses and governments address budget shortfalls resulting from COVID-19. That said, the degrees or decline and recovery will vary by end use market and geography and will be influenced by future governmental actions. Infrastructure, construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways, roads and streets is expected to be the most near-term resilient as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded. However, State Departments of Transportation or DOTs may decrease the scale or postpone the timing of future construction is very balanced lower revenue collections and other short-term funding needs relating to the COVID-19 impact, particularly if there is no near-term federal assistance. These impacts will vary by state. For example, Texas DOT scheduled lettings for fiscal year 2021, which begins September 1st are currently planned at $7 billion comparable to fiscal year 2020. Earlier this month, Texas DOT also reiterated its $77 billion 10-year unified transportation plan. To ease funding shortfalls to its DOT budget, Colorado will issue certificates of participation to advance plan projects, the majority of which are concentrated along the mega region following the I-25 corridor, which has been the strategic focus of our Rocky Mountain business. Of our Top 10 states, Carolina DOT faces the toughest near-term funding challenges. As a reminder, NCDOT temporarily suspended awards for certain projects in response to pre-COVID-19 funding issues, and other factors. Since then, new contract advertisements have been further delayed. For the near-term NCDOT will benefit from $700 million in build NC bond revenues to fund existing transportation programs. Longer term, we anticipate transportations ballot initiatives, as well as new revenue enhancing recommendations from the NC first commission, which is tasked with evaluating North Carolina\u2019s growing transportation investment needs and ensuring that critical financial resources are available. Despite some near-term DOT headlines, the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal infrastructure package will provide multiyear upside, while it is unlikely a successor bill will be agreed upon and signed into law prior to Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act expiration on September 30th, we feel confidence new legislation will be enacted and provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15-years. When this occurs, it will be a big win for our industry and for Martin Marietta. For non-residential construction activity on existing projects has continued, some commercial and institutional projects in the design or planning stages are being delayed or cancelled. The Dodge Momentum Index or DMI, a monthly measure of a first report for non-residential building projects and planning, which has historically led construction spending for non-residential building by a full-year is down 20% from its most recent peak in July of 2018. However to contextualize the June reading the Great Recession peak to trough DMI decline was 62%. And prudently since the Great Recession, Martin Marietta has purposefully shifted our non-residential exposure to be more heavy industrial focus, as we have expanded our geographic footprint along major commerce corridors. Aggregates intensive warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to lead non-residential activity as businesses increase capacity for ecommerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services. Further large liquefied natural gas or LNG projects along the Texas Gulf Coast that are actively underway have broadly continued. However, start dates for the next wave of projects have been postponed. Longer term, we believe non-residential construction activity could benefit from more companies streamlining their supply chains and repatriating manufacturing operations back to the United States providing potential multiyear upside to heavy industrial construction. Residential construction is rebounding more quickly than anticipated by homebuilders and third-party forecasters. After decline in April, the National Association of homebuilders housing market index are widely recognized survey designed to measure sentiment for the U.S. single family housing market return to pre-pandemic levels in July, signaling that residential growth may lead to an overall economic recovery. Consistent with recent homebuilder commentary activity has strengthened as Martin Marietta states have reopened, demonstrating pent up housing demand following the COVID-19 related pause in the spring selling season. Nationally housing starts remain below the 50-year annual average of 1.5 million despite notable population gains. Freddie Mac estimates that 2.5 million housing units are needed to address the current nationwide housing shortage. This situation is particularly evident in states with significant under supply, including Texas, Colorado, North Carolina and Florida, which are all in our top 10 states. These trends, along with historically low mortgage rates bode well for future expansion in single family housing activity, which is two to three times more aggregates intensive and multi-family housing given the typical ancillary non-residential and infrastructure construction activity. Also longer term, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit across all three of our primary end uses from accelerated to organization trends, as for homebuilders and the shift to remote work encourage more prospective homebuyers to move to smaller metro or suburban locations. Our leading Southeastern and Southwestern footprint provides us a distinct competitive advantage in regions with diverse employment opportunities, land availability, favorable climate and a lower cost of living. Moving forward, we are confident in Martin Marietta\u2019s opportunities to build on our successful track record of financial and operational outperformance. SOAR 2025, our strategic plan for the next five years will be finalized this year, and provides the framework to support our capital performance, price discipline, cost management, sustainable practices, talent development, and succession planning initiatives. We have already made great strides on these endeavors. Earlier this month, we streamlined our business structure into five operating divisions East, Central and Southwest, West, and Magnesia Specialties. This new structure better aligns our business product offerings and geographies, provides experienced executives with increased responsibilities and opportunities, strengthens our ability to provide outstanding customer service and further enhances our industry leading cost profile. In closing, we are all living in unprecedented and dynamic times. And that will likely persists as the pandemic continues unabated. Moving forward and our attractive underlying fundamentals, strategic priorities and world-class teams position Martin Marietta to responsibly navigate today\u2019s challenging environment and to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. Overall, we continue to feel confident about the future and our plan to continue building on Martin Marietta\u2019s long track record of success and delivering sustainable, value creation and superior returns for investors. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc.\nTrey Grooms: Hey good morning everyone.\nHoward Nye: Good morning Trey.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. So I guess first I want to focus on margins. I guess demand is going to be what it is going to be. But in the materials business, you know gross profit improvement across the board and that is even with down revenue in most segments and Jim touched on some of the benefits there, but can you talk about kind of the puts and takes there and we understand, diesel was your friends in the quarter, but you know, even outside of diesel where maybe you had some good guys that we could see continue going forward?\nHoward Nye: Trey thanks for the question. You are right diesel was the friends, but we managed our labor. We managed SG&A, we managed our efficiencies and other things that we believe have the capacity to endure actually quite well during the quarter. Trey what we are endeavoring to do and I think what you have seen in the quarter is we are building a business that has the ability and should be expected to outperform as we go through cycles. So to your point volume is going to be, where the volume is going to be, and volume was down 4% for the quarter, but we saw profitability going nicely up, but pricing is a big piece of that and that has been something that Martin Marietta has demonstrated, I think extraordinary skill around managing. We have a depleting resource. We want to make sure we are getting good value for it. We are also going to flex very carefully on the labor side and the other thing that I think you are seeing evidence of is we have been very thoughtful in the way that we deploy capital. So I think if we look at the CapEx has done relative to our ability to continue to gain efficiencies that has been an important piece of it. One thing that I would call out to you in particular and really the comments I just gave you went specifically to the aggregates business. But I think two, if we look at our cement business, that also saw down volumes for the quarter, we are seeing much better reliability numbers relative to our mid loading operation and hunter facilities as well. So what we are seeing across our footprint is profitability, improved efficiencies, improved costs in a number of dimensions, but we are also getting the price stray and that is something that matters.\nTrey Grooms: Got it. Okay. That is helpful and encouraging, especially in the face of the volume that you are facing. And as to the follow-up you mentioned that you could see additional demand slowing in the next couple of quarters or in the coming quarters. But if you could dive into that a bit more because, you were looking for something similar or had some similar comments during the last earnings call. So that doesn't seem like a new outlook necessarily but things have held in better, you know than expected. And it sounds like July trends are still largely the same as the second quarter. So just trying to understand, you know, maybe high level timing and I'm understanding you are not giving exact guidance, but if you look over your three primary businesses infrastructure non-res and res, how you rank your outlook for those and where you see some potential or for relative strength or weakness.\nHoward Nye: Sure Trey, happy to try to do that. And I'm with you. I mean, I don't think what we are saying today relative to outlook should be a surprise to anyone. I think it is actually a very consistent conversation we have been having. And if we look at it, volume is down 4% in aggregate for the quarter profits were up. So I think that gives you a sense of it. Here is how I would break down the end users as you think of it. Look infrastructure for the quarter was actually pretty steady. I think one of the questions is what will phase four stimulus look like because it is been well documented with gas taxes going down state clearly have had some degree of revenue challenges with respect to that particular dimension. It is fascinating to me to see where AASHTO is today, AASHTO to making an ask that there would be about $37 billion in the phase four stimulus that would go directly to state DOTs. If that happens, I have to tell you state DOTs are going to probably be in a pretty good place. What I have tried to do with the prepared remarks too to give you a sense of where are our top three state DOTs, even irrespective of that may come from some form of COVID stimulus. And I think what you have heard is Texas DOTs in a pretty good place, Colorado DOT is going to use certificates of participation to help themselves out. And NCDOT despite having more challenges and those other two, I will tell you DOT we feel a lot better about today than we did when we were talking to in the first quarter. But there is now FY 2021 bedding are estimated there to 1.3 million that is really similar to 2016 level and well above that we have seen before is about a $600 million estimate. So, I think DOT and infrastructure is going to be relatively steady. I think a lot hinges on that phase will look like. I think res is going to be up, I think res could be up relatively nicely in a number of markets. And I think the footprint that we have is going to help that pretty considerably. I think you are clearly going to see more single family housing activity than we have seen for a while. And here is an interesting Trey that is worth noting. Potential single family housing activities we look at it at least prospectively. During the run from 1990 to 2009, single family building comprised about 80% of what we are seeing in the housing market. Over the last several years, the last 10-years, it has been modestly less than 70% of that. So again, if we see single family housing moving in a more normalized fashion and we think we will - we think that is going to be a pretty attractive price. Non-res is likely to be the area in which you are going to see a bit more near-term softness and portions of it, and probably strength in others. So as we think about non-res, what I would suggest is as follows. Heavy non-res is likely to perform relatively well. What do I mean by that? What are we seeing more warehousing in data centers in the works? The answer is yes, I mean, are we seeing more work with Facebook in places like [indiscernible], yes. Are we seeing more work with Google? Yes, but are we seen more work with Amazon and others? Yes, we are. Do I think hospitality and retail shops may feel a little more near-term pressure? I think they probably will. But part of what you heard me say in the prepared commentary as well, is we have been very careful to build our business in ways that we feel like major commerce corridors will continue to grow in an outsized way. So I think we are positioned well for there. The other thing that I will say is the smallest piece of our business can rock and rail and actually had a pretty attractive quarter. And we started balance volume actually up and we are not surprised by that. We saw that principally in the Western United States. And we see that is something that is likely to be relatively stable to flat going forward. So again, Trey I will try to hit all four of those end users, but of course, infrastructure and non-res and res are the three big ones.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. That all makes sense. Thank you for taking my questions Howard very helpful. I will pass it on.\nHoward Nye: You bet. Take care Trey.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi thank you for taking my questions today. Just following on, on the infrastructure piece and appreciate the color that you had in your prepared commentary. Looking at Phase 4 stimulus and the lending highway reauthorization. But if you could for listeners really filter the noise in terms of what T&I committee in the house presented versus EPW and the senate and what that could mean, and really kind of a scenario analysis of what really happens to infrastructure volumes, if something happened and if something doesn't happen?\nHoward Nye: Kathryn thanks for the questions. So really, we are going to look at that in two different buckets. Well if you think about what reauthorization looks like. As a sudden prepared comments, we don't think that happens before September 30th. So we think they will probably use your longer term CR. That is nothing to be alarmed by the way. I don't think they are going to issue a longer term continuing resolutions, because they think it is going to last for a long time. I think they may put in place optically what would be a longer term continuing resolutions simply to continue giving states the confidence to keep running projects. I don't think, it means they slow down on coming up with reauthorized bill. So to your point there are two different starting points, Kathryn. Last July vicinity PW came out with unanimity around the $287 billion plan. And that is basically a very nice percentage increase of where we were relative to the FAST Act. Now to give you more recent issues, house C&I released their plan, that was $319 billion, that was a 41% increase over the FAST Act. In the near-term, this is at least worth considering. And that is the House Appropriations Subcommittee on transportation, housing and urban development. Passed legislation that would provide about $107 billion in resources for U.S. DOT for FY 2021 including almost $62 billion for the highway programs, that is up 33%. So one of the questions I think is a fair one is what does a CR look like? And so I think normally you are looking at a CR, that is probably flat for some period of time, as they work toward, but I think evidently will likely be an increased multiyear highway bill. So Kathryn to your point. Worst case, you have a CR is flat. Best case, you have a CR that actually has some growth to it. I think expected case issue get a bill next year that is a nice increase several credit for the FAST Act does. And I equally think the conversations that have been had recently, relative to Phase 4 stimulus have not as to fear like the likelihood of seeing some very direct assistance. Going to state DOTs is actually better than we would have thought properly, when we were having this conversation three months ago. And again, the AASHTO asked there is around $30 billion. So I have tried to outline what I think the subs are, and I have tried to handicap where I think they sit.\nKathryn Thompson: Okay that is helpful. And then shifting gears to the pricing commentary and we went through a few puts and takes in terms of what patted pricing for the quarter. But when you look at the bigger secular trends that are going to be coming up importantly on the residential housing. What and how should we think about pricing from a geographic and a mix standpoint, if there ends up being a bigger mix of residential versus non-res in market exposure?\nHoward Nye: You know, I don't think end use is going to be a big driver and what we see relative to price increases. It is fascinating , for example, if you have got a single a home builder and they're coming through, they're probably buying stone at this price, which is frankly a pretty high price as things go generally. But I would think if you are seeing just standard growth along those different end users, and you are seeing in Southeast and Southwest, and clearly you have got higher ASPs in the Southeast right now from doing southwest you might have some geographic mix issues if you come from that. But from a margin perspective or from a pricing increase perspective, I wouldn't expect to see anything that would be particularly notable in any of that. I think the primary thing that you are going to continue to see is good, steady price increases, because I think that is something that would just recognize the value of, and we have locations that put us in a position that we can get the value that we need for our shareholders.\nKathryn Thompson: Alright. Thank you for taking my questions today.\nHoward Nye: Thank you Kathryn.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Just following up on pricing or do you discuss 2020 ags pricing up 34%, which has maybe slightly below your pre-COVID expectations and can you talk about mix just now, but you also talked looking slightly delayed price increases in certain markets. And just wondering if those were purely a function of slack demand or maybe some increased competitive intensity or if there is any kind of other color you can get there.\nHoward Nye: Yes, I guess I would say several things. The primary driver so far has really been product mix and geographic mix. Just be clear on that. And when we are talking about delays, we are not talking about delays that were more than in the 45-day or 60-day range. And typically the delay and the number you had it late, you didn't have to lay in the number. And it happened really quite sporadically. I want to say it happened in probably two or three different sub markets. So I didn't view it as anything that made me feel remarkably different about the way the pricing situation works. The primary people who I would say pushed to at least see some deferment. If you recall in the earliest, earliest stages of COVID homebuilders in some instances were just walking away from subdivisions and taking about a 60-day to 90-day time out. I think in some of those instances, they were really afraid and looking for some immediate help. And I think some competitors and some instances did that. I think in some instances too, you had some readymix concrete producers who were looking for some lower inputs. Frankly we were not inclined to meet those. And we probably brought some modest share in some places, we have certainly done that before in cement. But again, we very have a value over volume philosophy that we bring to this. So from our perspective, Anthony, the delays were immaterial, but at the same time we try to be resilient through this.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That is very helpful. And you talked about kind of gradual, but not precipitous decline in second half demand. And I'm wondering if you could distinguish just directionally between ags, cement, readymix and asphalt in terms of you know where second half volumes might hold up a little bit better, or maybe see some incremental puncture just based on what you saw in 2Q and end of July.\nHoward Nye: No. I think in many respect, if you looked at the commentary that I gave on geography in the prepared remarks that is probably a pretty fair way to think of it in the second half as well. What is interesting to me Anthony is we put up a record first half and a record second quarter. And actually one of the areas that had a tougher quarter was actually our mid Atlantic division and our mid Atlantic division has both higher average selling prices and higher profitability. So it tells me that the balance of the business is actually performing extraordinarily well. We see good business right now in Texas. We see good business in Colorado, we see business in portions of the central United States. We are seeing, I think, good solid business in Florida. And we think all of those will persist for the balance of the year. We are actually seeing very good businesses in cement in Texas right now, as well. The first stage obviously really we are more geared toward aggregates. Obviously, the only hot mix business we have is in Colorado it is a very, very good first half we think it is going to have a good second half as well. And then Magnesia Specialties, it is fascinating when we say that businesses is hitting an air pocket right now, I think that is what it is. We think steel found bottom actually in June. We think it is going to slowly get better. We are not seeing a huge bounce back in Magnesia Specialties in the second half of the year, but even in a challenge, first half, it had margins of 37%. So I think that gives you a pretty good snapshot of ags, cement, the downstream business and the Magnesia Specialties as well.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That is very helpful. I will turn it over.\nHoward Nye: Thank you Anthony.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Well, really nice quarter. And, I'm just wondering, can you just expand on the discussion of what went right this quarter, normal seasonality would have you had about 27% gross margins. And you folks did about 10% better than that. And I appreciate the comments about operating efficiency. Can you just expand on those because volumes were obviously weaker than normal seasonality, but margins stronger is just really notable. And I'm just wondering, can you just provide a little bit more context on the drivers of the sequential improvement? And I realized you breached a year-over-year, but this question really stands out to me.\nHoward Nye: Now, I'm happy to try to do that. Look obviously, energy was a piece of that. It wasn't everything, but it was a nice piece of it. I think controlling labor was a piece of it. I still think you can do that with greater efficiencies in some place. I do think overall efficiencies by the way and we are a piece on it. And we talked about the fact that we are seeing much higher efficiencies in our cement business, all that stuff we have seen nice improvement. Over time it goes Midlothian and Hunter so that that is certainly going to help. The other thing that I will say Jerry and I mentioned that in the prepared comments and it is in our released today as well. This was an extraordinary safe quarter. And I think safety and you have heard us speak to that as a core value of this business, drives increased efficiencies and simply makes your business better and makes your people better. And from we are sitting here and happier with total injury incident rates and loss time incident rates, both exceeding world class standards. I think that really speaks to how teams are operating. The other thing that I will say relative to efficiencies is we have been very careful with how we have looked at capital allocation and CapEx over the last several years. And I think we are starting to see some of the efficiencies from that as well, which is one of the reasons that we are not at all shy, for example, to take the midpoint of the guidance that we have given relative CapEx this year. And as I think you saw, we have taken that up by about $25 million. So Jerry I wish I could point to one thing and say, this is it, I think it is a series of things. And I think when we go back to the notion that our aim is to continue to build an increasingly better business, they can go through cycles and outperform in any of those. I think that is what we are seeing.\nJerry Revich: And then in terms of asphalt pricing, paving pricing concrete. Can you just talk about your competitive position in your key markets and whether with the volume drawdown that you are looking for over the next couple of quarters. What is your degree of confidence in being able to hold line on pricing in those downstream businesses? Obviously, we know, what you are going to do in aggregate, but can you comment on the downstream market please?\nHoward Nye: Sure I can and If we think about asphalt and paving Jerry, the nice thing from our perspective is the only question we have that businesses in Colorado. And last year as you will recall Jerry, they had a very weather impacted here. So they came into the year with very attractive backlogs. But again, we are seeing very good efficiencies. The asphalt and to paving we have is really running from Northern Colorado through Denver, down to Southern Colorado. We have actually seen bidding opportunities accelerated in an outpacing here in June, after a slow first half relative to bidding activity. What is odd, in many respects, is if we are looking out farther. I think generally, we feel better about the business today, for example, than we did even after Q1. So if we are looking at asphalt pricing liquid itself is about $420, that is down about 5% per ton. We think liquids going to remain in that range. We think our bidding opportunities are going to stay attractive. We think we have got a very good business in Colorado. And of course, one of the tricky things in Colorado is making sure that you are in a position to get good quality specifications stone, and we are in a position to start supplying with that. So we feel good about that asphalt and paving business and of course it had a very attractive first half. With respect to readymix concrete they had good first half too, I mean the downstream businesses performed really quite well, if you are looking like-for-like volumes. readymix was 8.7% keeping in mind that is really pulling that ArkLaTex business out. If you are trying to look at it geographically, in Colorado, where we have readymix, those volumes are up a little bit more than 14%. If we are looking in Texas, which is the other place that we have had that particular business, they were up around 6.2%. And again, part of what we are seeing is much better efficiencies in that business, delivery, costs and efficiencies are better. And again, these are not big surprises to us and we think many of these to your point are sustainable as well Jerry.\nJerry Revich: And Howard in concrete do you think you can hold the line on price with the volume outlook that you laid up?\nHoward Nye: You know part of that, I think is something on that is aggregates and cement in those markets. Aggregates in cement in Texas, and aggregates in Colorado, which obviously we saw supply are going up. And when you are see the input costs, at least in my experience, in readymix going up, those tend to be very helpful actually to the downstream businesses, and we are very mindful of that.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Thank you Jerry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane BNP Paribas.\nPaul Roger: Hi there, good afternoon form London guys. Nice quarter.\nHoward Nye: Thank you Paul.\nPaul Roger: Yes. Just moving Howard on to maybe away from the trade and the outlook, may be on to capital allocation obviously Jim mention the priorities which you talked about before. But you clearly do have a strong balance sheet and when do you think you could start to deploy some of that again. Are you resuming a buyback or maybe by doing some distress M&A and what is the deals pipeline looking like right now.\nHoward Nye: Paul thanks for the question. That is a good one, because if you look at our capital allocation priorities, we have long said the right deal is our number one priority. And I will say several things. One, I think our teams do an extraordinary job on transaction identification. I think they also do an extraordinary job on going through the transaction and looking at where we can get synergies. In our operating teams if you go back and look at whether it is [CXI] (Ph) or bluegrass, or the transactions in Colorado or otherwise have outperformed relative to synergies, that is a long way of saying that we remain very focused on growing our business. When we look at growing their business, we are focused on two things in particular, what is the geography and what are the end uses? It is an aggregate sled business but we are keenly focused on player, because the player really dictates how a business is going to perform. And a good example of that is we have had very good performance in Texas. You also saw very good performance in Colorado, but equally we are having great performance in the central which is just down, so we are seeing great performance all the way across. Relative to share buy backs and otherwise, I think the primary thing that we are waiting for right now, Paul is just some modest visibility forward on what is going to happen, particularly with respect to some of these government elections. I think we will have much better sense very soon. First going to have on Phase 4, I think what happens with Phase 4, it is going to give us a much better sense of how the infrastructure piece is going to look. So I think we are just a couple of pieces of information away from being able to really buybacks and otherwise. But please remember our primary aim is the right transaction going forward. Number two, assuring that we are investing in the business in a responsible way and you have actually seen us take CapEx midpoint up $25 million and then returning cash to shareholders through two different ways, a meaningful and sustainable dividend and our Board will obviously look at our dividend in August. So there will be here next month and they will look at that and then relative to share buy backs. I think we have touched base on that Paul.\nPaul Roger: The terms of the deal pipeline Howard, I mean are you seeing some distressed opportunities come on the radar or are they quiet coming in?\nHoward Nye: There are not a lot of distress opportunities per say out there, because particularly in the aggregates business, they tend to have pretty healthy balance sheets today. The family businesses are in pretty good shape. Our view has long been that succession tends to be a bigger driver of potential transactions in aggregates than been not. So I don't want to give you a sense that there are people who are in trouble and they are knocking down our doors right now that would not be accurate, but there are plenty of ordinary, typical and sensible transactions that we are looking at by now Paul.\nPaul Roger: That is great. Thanks a lot.\nHoward Nye: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies.\nPhilip Ng: Hey guys, impressive quarter, great execution. Howard, I guess you noted backlog should carry through the near-term, but you know and as you will see some decline in product demand, can you kind of help parse that commentary a little more. Does that imply that you are expecting the year-over-year decline, the back half to accelerate from 2Q levels and when you think about 2021, appreciate a lot of moving pieces, especially on the policy front. How are you thinking about 2021 playing out on demand side?\nHoward Nye: Yes, as we think about the back half 2020, I think to your point a lot can hinge on what does Q4 looks like, frankly from a weather perspective. But it is interesting, if we look at our commentary, much of what happened in the first half with some of that COVID related sure it was more of that in half one weather related in COVID. Probably so. If we look at backlogs it is interesting to me if we look at Mid-Atlantic, customer backlogs are actually up around 17%. If we look in Southwest, customer backlogs where up around 30. If we look into cement, and this is a big one, I mean, there have been around 43%. At the same time, if we look at readymix, those are down in the low double digits, but at the same time we are seeing those backlogs improve in Q3 particularly related to infrastructure. And if we look into West, we are seeing backlogs down in the low double digits of very high backlogs coming into the year because of the way that weather had been last year.  So I think in many respects, we are sensitive to where will states be with their safe funding, and their revenues as we enter half to end they are feeling potentially in some respects, more COVID pressure than they felt so far. Number one. Number two, what is going to happen to portions of non-res meaning particularly what happens to that that lighter piece of it? Look, obviously if we see some stimulus come through infrastructure is going to be in a pretty good place, but if we look at Q2, with volume down for, that to me feels like modest volume down, that feels like a normal typical cyclical reaction design. And I think as we are looking at three and we are looking at four, four can obviously weather affected, but again I think if we are just looking overall at what has happening in the United States, and what is happening globally for us to put our heads in the sand and say that there is not at least an opportunity for something that does not feel like the cycle did in the great recession, not at all. But could feel a bit like this quarter did, particularly as we go into Q3, which last year, as you will recall Phil, was a really big quarter for us. So you have got a tough compare. You know I think the commentary that you have offered is probably right.\nPhilip Ng: Got it. And that is really a helpful color. And when you talk about now and non-res, you, you know obviously there are some puts and takes, can you remind us what your exposure is, if you have any on the high rise side and then office, hospital and retail that might be a little weaker in terms of strength that you are seeing and heavy. Is that to kind of offset some of are those potential headwinds? Thanks a lot.\nHoward Nye: Thanks so much Phil. The fact is we are a Southeast, Southwest driven business, we are not in downtown Chicago, we are not in downtown Manhattan. So the business - that are growing tend to grow out. They don't tend as much to grow up, if you know what I mean. And the other thing that I will say and we said it in the prepared remarks is we have been very focused on moving our business intentionally over the last decade, so that we are more focused on these heavy non-res projects. If we look at the way non-res is held up, it has been in the high 30% of our business. If we look at really what that look like over a longer term, it ought to be closer to 30%. That is where it has been. Infrastructure should be more as a percentage than we have seen over the last several years, non-res candidly should be modestly less. We think we may see some of that, but equally as we look at the heavy projects that are really taking up a good bit of our time right now. We are seeing very attractive increasing bidding in that respect. I'm not sure that it totally offsets, but the life side of it could be but I think it is a nice counterbalance to it.\nPhilip Ng: Great. Thanks for the color.\nHoward Nye: You bet Phil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke with Deutsche Bank.\nSeldon Clarke: They thanks for the question. I know you have referenced 60% incremental lump aggregate gross profit in the past. But just given we did in the second quarter and the divergence between volume and pricing that we are seeing. Is there any way to breakdown detrimental or incremental as it relates to volume and price and how we should think about cost inflation? Or is there a level where pricing can't necessarily offset volumes, where you wouldn't see aggregate gross profit gross margin expansion?\nJames Nickolas: Well, I think theoretically, it is possible. We don't anticipate that to be the case. So the pricing is one thing we can bank on. We get it every quarter. It is sustainable and it does flow to the bottom line. So that is the most powerful weapon in our quiver. And So we have got that growing force. Additionally, this quarter into the foreseeable few quarters, we have got lower diesel prices. So that benefited this year, this quarter, it will benefit next quarter, the rest of this year I think. So those are things that we are expecting. Otherwise this is blocking, tackling with watching your variable cost, making sure you are flexing. The theoretical question you are posing. I mean, if volume drops tremendously, of course, your fixed costs, the absorption isn't there, where you need it to be. And that is where you run into some headwinds, but we don't see that happening quite frankly.\nHoward Nye: Seldon, one thing, just from a color perspective, I will add to that. I think it is really important to underscore this. The recovery that ended with COVID was not a construction led recovery. And we have not seen that before in your lifetime or mine. And the fact is, we look particularly for housing is and the throughout the birth economy is required. We actually see a lot of things that lead us to believe that the post COVID recovery can and likely should be building led. The other thing that I would pointed out on Jim's commentary that was just entirely correct, is we are seeing nice price with volume down and with energy down. Oftentimes when we see energy going up, we actually see that as something that helps push ASPs up as well. So I wanted to make sure that we share that with you.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay that is helpful. And then just piggybacking on an earlier question on volumes. How should we think about the dispersion on a relative basis across various product categories for volumes in the back half?\nHoward Nye: Well, I think primarily, as I mentioned before, cement is being really resilient right now. I think we anticipate readymix continuing to be quite resilient, I think, and it is going to have a good year in the primary thing that we are speaking about and most of our commentary tends to be around aggregates and where that is going to be near-term and over the next few quarters. So that is how I would ask you to think about it right now so.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nHoward Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Great thanks. Just one more question on aggregate margins in the second half of the year. I mean you are painting a picture of volumes down kind of in this 3% to 4% range, assuming there is no major kind of change in trend or deceleration within markets? Pricing off low-single-digits, seems like diesel is going to be a tailwind? Is there anything that you can see be it from a comp perspective or stripping costs or inventories that could preclude margin expansion in the second half of the years, is it really just kind of a function of how the volumes look?\nHoward Nye: Yes. I think it is two things, I think it is what kind of volume look and where the volumes look right. And I think part of what you are probably looking at and you are pleased with. I know I'm looking at and I'm pleased with it, is to see margin expansion despite the fact Mid-Atlantic had volumes down pretty considerably. So I think part of what I would ask you to keep in mind is Mid-Atlantic particularly with some of the headwinds that NCDOT has right now. We will probably have a more challenged year-over-year volume than other parts of the business. And again, that is a very high margin part of our business. So what you are seeing is great improvement in other parts of the business, we are seeing DOT in North Carolina putting itself in a position that really is we start getting into next year. It is going to look and feel a lot more normal relative to what history has been. But I do think that geographic mixed issue is one that you understand and it is worth noting.\nGarik Shmois: Great thank you. Follow-up question on cement. How much of the cement volume goes into West Texas oil and gas markets and the headwind of pricing in Texas is this mostly a function of mix or are you seeing more competitive landscape in the West region that has been packing things.\nHoward Nye: Yes. actually that is a great question Garik. And here is what I would say. We don't send significant volumes to West Texas. Clearly the biggest volumes that we have will be in DFW and in San Antonio and then those related markets. So if we go back and look I want to say full-year last year, you are probably looking at 30,000 or 40,000 tons of what's gone into West Texas those would not have been notable numbers. If you look purely at pricing though, here is what is worth noting. ASPs in West Texas are $200. If we look at really what the numbers look like in North, Texas and Central, we were seeing price increases in the range of around 4% Garik. So if you are seeing a 4% price there and you are getting back to the numbers that you would have expected, it is not the $8 going into the year, but if we are looking at overall same-on-same 4% price up in cement in Texas with down volumes that is a pretty good number. So if you look at more profitability, volumes down price up, actually much better efficiencies. And the other thing to keep in mind Garik is we actually anticipate having less - downtime and maintenance spend on terms this year than we did last year. We think it is probably going to be about $7 million less in 2020 than it was in 2019. So when you really stack up the issues relative to the cement business, we think it is pretty attractive. And Garik you were there at the time too. You will remember that one of the things that we thought was possible was to have particular pricing in cement in Texas, look overtime, at least relative to a stability perspective, more like aggregate pricing debt. And I think that is exactly what we saw in this quarter. And as you also know, we have been willing when we needed to give up share in that marketplace to continue to be resilient in pricing. So if we go back to 2014, we had a 22% share in that market. If we look at it today based on contract numbers, we are at about 19%, but pricing is behaving in profitability is going up. Garik does that help?\nGarik Shmois: It sure did. Thanks for the help and that is all.\nHoward Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning Howard and Jim. Hey Howard how is private demand in North Carolina. Has that helping to offset weak DOT?\nHoward Nye: Yes, private demand is pretty good. I mean, look housing is good in the state and it is going to be good in the state, private non-res is good in the state. It varies by geography. Charlotte's actually having a pretty good year. Raleigh Durham is having a pretty good year. Greensboro is not having a year but Raleigh Durham Chapel Hill is happening is happening the year that Charlotte had. And going to it was actually from an ASP perspective, a very attractive market for us. But the private is holding up pretty well in part because Josh has held up reasonably well here Adam. And look at the end of the day you got a lot of people moving to North Carolina and population is always going to be your single biggest driver of aggregate consumption.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then in Texas, how do your backlogs work in Texas and the Austin, I guess as a real surprise to see peel off some aggregates exposure in Austin, can you talk about that too?\nHoward Nye: Actually, we didn't see any aggregate exposure in Austin. We sold some businesses called ArkLaTex. And so the only thing we did in Austin is we sold a depleted standing gravel location. So that that was purely an excess property. And that is what Jim was referencing, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a depleted site for $100 million. So actually I have to tell you from the way we look at that, that is a really nice win. So we did not get rid of any aggregates that were there. And again, back to your point, if we are looking at backlogs and asked specifically about Texas, Southwest backlogs are up about 30%. And if we looked into cement, they are up about 43% and if we look in readymix, they are down low double-digits but actually somewhat recovering right now due to some Q3 building activity.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks Howard.\nHoward Nye: You are welcome Adam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.\nStanley Elliott: Hey good morning everybody. Thank you all for fitting me in. Howard - the infrastructure piece, I mean it sounds like the states are doing better than what we would have guessed kind of given the initial shock. There are some discussions around, the federal government providing money to state, we also talked about a [CR] (Ph) kind of worst case scenario being flat. Will that keep infrastructure volumes pretty consistent into next year? Just like in the past, we have had CR just been up and down, up and down and hard to get a gauge, but it just feels different this time around, given all of those things I have mentioned plus, you know just a general higher level of funding coming in from the state side.\nHoward Nye: Yes, I think two things Stanley. One, I think if you really get some significant phase for stimulus there is - the zip code of what AASHTO looking in for that 37 billion, and it is going directly to state DOTs. I think that is actually a really important amount of money that would fill a hole. So we will begin with that. I think to your second point relative to the CR, I think you raised a really good point. And I think part of what happened in the last downturn and you will remember it well Stanley because you are watching it, the CRs in that ended up oftentimes being very short-term, and that is why I made the comment earlier, people shouldn't be surprised, if you see out of the box, a long-term CR. And a long-term CR does not mean it is going to be in place for long-term, is simply done to make sure states continue to know that they can plan longer term as Congress goes about the process of probably having a conference and then coming up with a new infrastructure bill. So I think to your point, yes, I think this does feel better than last time, because I think whatever CR going to go in will be longer. I think whatever highway bill we get out will be larger. And I think one of your swing factors is brought to space for look like relative to A to the space. And I think we will know that here in the next - I think by the end of August, we will have a pretty good feel for what that is going to look like.\nStanley Elliott: Yes. I guess the good news is, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of wholesale project cancellations. But can you talk about how you will and really the rest of the industry has been able to manage inventory levels, how do you feel about them going into the back half a year? And I think about that kind of in the context of pricing and then as we look out?\nJames Nickolas: Hey Stan it is Jim. Our original levels as in both constant of slightly up from a year ago and question from Q1, but no outsize moves there. And so that is just roughly prefer study production levels to offset each shipment levels. So that is pretty even keel there's no shortage is in sight, so there is quite rebalances at the moment.\nHoward Nye: And we don't see that having an effect good better otherwise on ASP. We think ASPs just all is going to behave well.\nStanley Elliott: I agree, I was just trying to make sure that others within the space are being as diligent as you guys are. So I appreciate the commentary. Talk to you soon.\nHoward Nye: Thanks Stanley.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Howard congratulations on a strong quarter 3.55 gross margins with that volume numbers fantastic. And I guess or I wanted explore a little further, maybe a question was asked earlier, let me try a slightly different angle. You know you talked about infrastructure non-res and res and what is your longer term target percentages or proportions might be within the business. The mid-40s for the infrastructure and 30% non-res and so on. I guess the question is, I guess that type of a proportional mix right now, what would be the variance from that 35.5 gross margin this quarter?\nHoward Nye: You know what, I don't think you would see a big movement in that particularly David. The only things that I think that may be different in that. I think housing might be a bigger piece of our pie, maybe for the foreseeable future than it would have historically. So if you think about it- David, if we looked at those numbers a decade plus ago, just the numbers very similar to what you just said, probably 45% of prospective 30% non-res probably low-teens, residential and then the rest would be ChemRock and Rail. I think res can stay elevated for a while, I think that is actually going to be good for us. Because I do think depending on the type of res, you know that could actually be good for ASPs. And I think the more single family housing that we see that it is going to be helpful. But again, I think that might help a little bit on the margin side. But overall, I think the margins that you have seen are - I don't think that was going to be end use driven.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. Just my second question, I guess on pricing, if we were to adjust those Bluegrass impacts from a year ago. What's your pricing at the end of this quarter?\nHoward Nye: You know I don't know that we had that per se. One thing I'm happy to tell you is we saw pricing in Maryland, up around 6.4%. So if you are looking to glean, we are getting some nice synergies from that in Bluegrass, we are. But I would really rather not go back and break up what that looks like. Because it is so integrated into our business particularly in places like Georgia today, but it gives you a good snapshot of what the Maryland business that really had very little synergy brought together, operationally has done relative to pricing.\nDavid MacGregor: Alright. That makes sense. Well thanks very much and good luck.\nHoward Nye: Thanks so much David.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.\nRohit Seth: Hey Howard, thanks for taking my question. I just noticed in your CEO commentary you talked about sort of 2025, and I was just curious in sort of 2025, do you have plans to rebalance the footprint performs very well the cycle, acquisitions with the organic growth is only up maybe one of the past five years. So just curious as we think in the front itself an infrastructure bill, highway bill, Texas clearly has very good run over last seven years, how you think about portfolio and where the opportunities are.\nHoward Nye: Yes. I guess what I would say is this Rohit, we have got two opportunities. We have got the opportunity to keep doing just what you saw in this quarter, and that is make the Martin Marietta that we have better. And I think that is what you saw in the quarter performance perspective. I think the other piece is we have got white space on the map that we can continue to move toward. And what I mean by that is, we have talked a lot, whether it was in sort of 2020 and you will hear in sort of 2025, where people are going is going to be what drives aggregate consumption and the mega regions across the United States is where people are going to be living. And we have demonstrated that obviously in an aggregates sled business we can continue to expand margin. So product what I liked about the Martin Marietta story is we have turned this business into one of the great aggregates companies in the world. I think it is one of the great materials companies in the world. We can continue to make it better and we can continue to grow it. And that is something that if I'm you, I would continue to expect Martin Marietta to do. And I would just say, go back and look at sort of 2020, and we have given you a pretty good roadmap of places that we would like to grow. The other thing that I would say relative to rebalancing when you look at a decade that went from one or two and 65% of our markets at the beginning of the decade to one or two and 90% of our markets by the end of the decade, also, we were looking for that leading position in markets that we find attractive. So we don't feel like in our heritage footprint, that there is an enormous amount of work to be done. There are some careful work to be done on occasion. And an example of that would be what we discussed earlier and that is the sale of the ArkLaTex ready-mix business. We didn't find that particularly a great fit for our aggregates led in Texas and so we pruned that. But that is the type of work that you should expect on the heritage portfolio. And you should expect us to continue to look to grow in new markets where we can find our way to one or two. \nRohit Seth: Alright. Thanks that is all I have.\nHoward Nye: Alright. Thank you Rohit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, afternoon, gentlemen. Just quickly, Howard in your prepared remarks you talked about in early this month a restructuring internally. Maybe you can share with more of the construct on that. That is something to toward your sort 2025 campaign. And is there just more efficiencies driven by that or just different strategies on the pricing or business front, just how you think through that as you are and even head towards your restructuring [Low Audio].\nHoward Nye: Mike that is a great question thank you for it. It is funny how timing works, we started talking to our Board, literally last August about the restructuring that was announced, that was effective on July 1, of this year. And what we did is we just - down some of our aggregate divisions. So what we have now is a Western division that is run out of Denver, we have a Southwest division that is run out of Dallas. We have an East division that is run here in Raleigh. And we have a Central division that is run out of Indianapolis and then we have our Magnesia Specialties business as well. So the retirements are part of that, where efficiencies are part of that, and it is the ability for that structure to endure to get people whether they are division presence, [PPGMs] (Ph), or otherwise, expanded responsibilities and growth in their careers, all of those things help drive decision. The nice thing is of course your benefit is you get efficiencies from it. And we were very fortuitous to be in a spot that this is what we were looking to do, even in a pre-COVID world, and then COVID comes along, and the very thoughtful planning that we had to your point as a part of sort of 2020 and as a part of sort of 2025 coalesced very nicely with a timing need, and it simply could not have worked better.\nMichael Dudas: Just my final follow-up would be, speaking of COVID, have you noticed anything, with the lockdowns or restarts in your important state, that are the tenured - thought process from your private customers or from the government or maybe some slowing in the pace of activity or bidding or letting because of some of the fears we see and hear constantly, and then from the media? Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Again thanks for that question. The fact is, as I tried to mention, whether at least for the quarter was probably more impactful than COVID was, but we would be naive to say that there wasn't a COVID effect out there. So, NCDOT feeling some degree of the rest pre-COVID, I'm sure they were. Are they feeling a little bit more postcode? Yes, they are. And so has that affected volumes, and with that particular department? It has. Has it affected some other DOTs and modest rates? To be sure it has. It is fairly effective some private businesses too. It is tough to fully quantify exactly what that is. But I do think people recognize how to live and how to work with this. And part of what has been interesting to me as we have operated all the way through this as an essential business and our nearly 9000 employee count, we have had about [90] (Ph) positive probate cases, the vast majority of which have gone home, recovered at home and come back to work. And we have only had literally a handful of what we have been able to identify as employee to employee COVID spread cases. So I think businesses, governments and others have learned how to work with us. It has clearly had an effect, it is going to have an effect for a period of time. I think the actual steward effect there become less, not more. And we will have to watch and see what the physical effects are, and how governmental stimulus works.\nMichael Dudas: That is encouraging. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Thank you Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] D.A. Davidson.\nUnidentified Analyst: So first off on the cement side of thing, do you have any commentary around the timing of planned maintenance expenses for cement this year, as well as any thoughts around a potential another cement price increase?\nHoward Nye: Well what I would say a cement price increases will come out again next year. So our intention is to come out typically once a year and put the price increases then so there shouldn't be any more on price increases this year. If we are looking at what cadence is going to be you know right now, we are forecasting probably about $3.5 million or $3.6 million worth of outage costs. So these are outage processes, I think that is what you are asking about in Q3. We are looking at probably around 0.5 million of those in Q4. And if you tell you that we did in Q1 and Q2, that means our total count outage costs for the year will be in the zip code of around $19.5 million, and that is about $6.9 million less than we saw in 2019.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. And then also on SOAR 2025, are you guys thinking about providing some more specific parameters or financial aspirations related to that this fiscal year?\nHoward Nye: The short answer is yes, we will. But we have got one important step that we need to do before we do that and that is, we need to present it to our Board of Directors. And that is exactly what management is going to do when the Board is here next month, or here in just a few weeks. And I'm sure as we come out later in the year and early next year. We can give you a much clearer picture of what our goals and intentions are on the SOAR 2025.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. I appreciate it. Thank you guys.\nHoward Nye: You bet. Thanks.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. \nHoward Nye: Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With our stead fast commitment to safety, cost discipline and operational excellence Martin Marietta has the right strategic priorities and best-in-class teams to responsibly navigate through these challenging times and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. We are moving forward with confidence and determination. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2020 results in just a few months. As always we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Howard Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We sincerely hope that you and your families are remaining safe and healthy as we continue to manage through these unprecedented times. As highlighted in this earnings released Martin Marietta delivered outstanding operational financial and safety performance, not withstanding some localized weather headwinds in the quarter and the broader uncertainties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. This performance is a testament to our company's commitment to our values, the world-class attributes of our business and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Martin Marietta established few profitability records for both the second quarter and the first half of the year driven by favorable pricing and proactive cost management across the building materials business, for the second quarter specifically consolidated gross margin expanded 200 basis points despite slightly lower revenues as compared with the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues improved 10 basis points to 5.6%. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 7.5% to $407 million and fully diluted earnings per share was $3.49, a 16% improvement. An addition to record financial performance and despite the challenging conditions, we also achieved the best safety performance in our history, companywide both our lost time and total entry, instant rates are better than world class safety levels. These superior results are directly attributable to our dedicated and talented employees who have continued to demonstrate resiliency during these uncertain times. I'm extraordinarily proud of how our team has adapted to our new health protocols, while remaining steadfastly focused on caring for one another safely and efficiently and seamlessly meeting our diverse stakeholders needs. Martin Marietta along with many of our customers has operated as a designated essential business during the COVID-19 shutdowns and subsequent phases which did experienced impact from a macro economic slowdown. Despite these challenges, second quarter product demand for building materials business remains strong across a number of our key geographies, including North Texas and the Front Range of Colorado, two of our leading vertically integrated markets. Contractors continued construction on projects already underway and have in some instances benefited from jobs that were accelerated to better leverage lower traffic volumes during shelter in place orders and new projects. In addition, we saw aggregate shipments growth in Georgia and Florida, despite above average rainfall in these states during the quarter and in Indiana. Overall quarterly aggregate shipments declined approximately 4% compared within the record prior your period volume. As reminder, our second quarter 2019 results benefited from blended deferred carryover work, sizeable energy sector projects and Midwest flooding repair activity. Aggregates pricing improved 3.3%. All divisions contributed to this growth underscoring the health of our markets and the importance of our locally driven pricing strategy. By region, the West group posted a 5.5% increase, reflecting favorable product mix. Pricing for the Mid-America Group improved 2% essential division, which is selling prices below the corporate average contributed a higher percentage of the Mid-America Group shipments consistent with the first quarter trends. Product mix limited Southeast Group pricing growth as a higher percentage of lower priced files and base stone were shipped.  Underlying demand for our Texas base cement business remains largely stable. However, second quarter cement shipments decreased 3% driven primarily by the decline in energy sector activity that has resulted from lower oil prices. West Texas oil wells cement shipments were down over 75% from pre-COVID expectations, a trend expected to continue until oil prices stabilize at a level that fosters additional investment in drilling activity in the Permian Basin. Throughout the quarter, we saw attractive and consistent pricing strength in our North and Central Texas cement operations. Specifically, cement prices in Dallas and San Antonio, the markets most proximate to our Midlothian and Hunter facilities were up 4%. That said notably lower shipments of higher priced oil wells specialty cement products down for West Texas limited overall price and growth. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, the readymix concrete shipments increased nearly 9% excluding prior year shipments from our southwest readymix divisions Arkansas, Louisiana and Eastern Texas business known generally as ArkLaTex, which we divested earlier this year. Overall, concrete pricing increased modestly, but was hindered by unfavorable product mix. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business establish a new quarterly record for asphalt shipments. Shipments increased 35% to 1.1 million tons, benefiting from market strength and pent up demand following a weather challenge 2019. Asphalt pricing declined 1% as customer segmentation was weighted more heavily toward publicly bid municipal projects, as opposed to negotiated private work. The company's Magnesia Specialties business experienced most pronounced COVID-19 headwinds during the second quarter, domestic and international chemicals demand declined as customers confronted COVID-19 related disruptions. Demand for a lime and periclase products also slowed significantly as steel producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19 induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers. Before discussing near-term and emerging trends. I will now turn the call over to Jim for review of our second quarter financial results and liquidity. Jim. Thanks, Jim, with the successful completion of an outstanding first half of 2020, we remain laser focused on managing our business through the macroeconomic upheaval from COVID-19 and related governmental responses. While in July product demand and pricing trends across our markets remain broadly consistent with second quarter, we feel it is premature to reinstate full-year 2020 earnings guidance given the uncertainty regarding the pandemic, potential phrase for stimulus and infrastructure reauthorization. Nonetheless, we remain highly confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business guided by our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan. We expect pricing resiliency and disciplined cost management to continue supporting the company's near-term performance. As the economy resets from COVID-19, we believe favorable pricing trends for our products will continue supported by disciplined locally driven pricing strategy and attractive geographic footprint. For aggregates specifically, we anticipate full-year 2020 pricing will increase 3% to 4% from the prior year. This range is slightly below our pre COVID-19 expectations given year-over-year geographic and product mix trends and slightly delayed price increases in certain markets. Texas cement pricing is also expected to remain resilient due to the state's tight supply demand dynamics. And the fact that our team markets are by design largely insulated from waterborne imports. Healthy aggregates in cement pricing trends should benefit our targeted downstream operations. Existing customer backlogs support the company's shipment levels in the near-term and certain regions where we operate, this year's weather has been more disruptive of construction activity and project cadence, than the pandemic. Yet we believe the industry will likely see a gradual, but not precipitous temporary slowing in product demand over the next few quarters as businesses and governments address budget shortfalls resulting from COVID-19. That said, the degrees or decline and recovery will vary by end use market and geography and will be influenced by future governmental actions. Infrastructure, construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways, roads and streets is expected to be the most near-term resilient as contractors advanced projects that have been awarded and funded. However, State Departments of Transportation or DOTs may decrease the scale or postpone the timing of future construction is very balanced lower revenue collections and other short-term funding needs relating to the COVID-19 impact, particularly if there is no near-term federal assistance. These impacts will vary by state. For example, Texas DOT scheduled lettings for fiscal year 2021, which begins September 1st are currently planned at $7 billion comparable to fiscal year 2020. Earlier this month, Texas DOT also reiterated its $77 billion 10-year unified transportation plan. To ease funding shortfalls to its DOT budget, Colorado will issue certificates of participation to advance plan projects, the majority of which are concentrated along the mega region following the I-25 corridor, which has been the strategic focus of our Rocky Mountain business. Of our Top 10 states, Carolina DOT faces the toughest near-term funding challenges. As a reminder, NCDOT temporarily suspended awards for certain projects in response to pre-COVID-19 funding issues, and other factors. Since then, new contract advertisements have been further delayed. For the near-term NCDOT will benefit from $700 million in build NC bond revenues to fund existing transportation programs. Longer term, we anticipate transportations ballot initiatives, as well as new revenue enhancing recommendations from the NC first commission, which is tasked with evaluating North Carolina's growing transportation investment needs and ensuring that critical financial resources are available. Despite some near-term DOT headlines, the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal infrastructure package will provide multiyear upside, while it is unlikely a successor bill will be agreed upon and signed into law prior to Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act expiration on September 30th, we feel confidence new legislation will be enacted and provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15-years. When this occurs, it will be a big win for our industry and for Martin Marietta. For non-residential construction activity on existing projects has continued, some commercial and institutional projects in the design or planning stages are being delayed or cancelled. The Dodge Momentum Index or DMI, a monthly measure of a first report for non-residential building projects and planning, which has historically led construction spending for non-residential building by a full-year is down 20% from its most recent peak in July of 2018. However to contextualize the June reading the Great Recession peak to trough DMI decline was 62%. And prudently since the Great Recession, Martin Marietta has purposefully shifted our non-residential exposure to be more heavy industrial focus, as we have expanded our geographic footprint along major commerce corridors. Aggregates intensive warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to lead non-residential activity as businesses increase capacity for ecommerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services. Further large liquefied natural gas or LNG projects along the Texas Gulf Coast that are actively underway have broadly continued. However, start dates for the next wave of projects have been postponed. Longer term, we believe non-residential construction activity could benefit from more companies streamlining their supply chains and repatriating manufacturing operations back to the United States providing potential multiyear upside to heavy industrial construction. Residential construction is rebounding more quickly than anticipated by homebuilders and third-party forecasters. After decline in April, the National Association of homebuilders housing market index are widely recognized survey designed to measure sentiment for the U.S. single family housing market return to pre-pandemic levels in July, signaling that residential growth may lead to an overall economic recovery. Consistent with recent homebuilder commentary activity has strengthened as Martin Marietta states have reopened, demonstrating pent up housing demand following the COVID-19 related pause in the spring selling season. Nationally housing starts remain below the 50-year annual average of 1.5 million despite notable population gains. Freddie Mac estimates that 2.5 million housing units are needed to address the current nationwide housing shortage. This situation is particularly evident in states with significant under supply, including Texas, Colorado, North Carolina and Florida, which are all in our top 10 states. These trends, along with historically low mortgage rates bode well for future expansion in single family housing activity, which is two to three times more aggregates intensive and multi-family housing given the typical ancillary non-residential and infrastructure construction activity. Also longer term, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit across all three of our primary end uses from accelerated to organization trends, as for homebuilders and the shift to remote work encourage more prospective homebuyers to move to smaller metro or suburban locations. Our leading Southeastern and Southwestern footprint provides us a distinct competitive advantage in regions with diverse employment opportunities, land availability, favorable climate and a lower cost of living. Moving forward, we are confident in Martin Marietta's opportunities to build on our successful track record of financial and operational outperformance. SOAR 2025, our strategic plan for the next five years will be finalized this year, and provides the framework to support our capital performance, price discipline, cost management, sustainable practices, talent development, and succession planning initiatives. We have already made great strides on these endeavors. Earlier this month, we streamlined our business structure into five operating divisions East, Central and Southwest, West, and Magnesia Specialties. This new structure better aligns our business product offerings and geographies, provides experienced executives with increased responsibilities and opportunities, strengthens our ability to provide outstanding customer service and further enhances our industry leading cost profile. In closing, we are all living in unprecedented and dynamic times. And that will likely persists as the pandemic continues unabated. Moving forward and our attractive underlying fundamentals, strategic priorities and world-class teams position Martin Marietta to responsibly navigate today's challenging environment and to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. Overall, we continue to feel confident about the future and our plan to continue building on Martin Marietta's long track record of success and delivering sustainable, value creation and superior returns for investors. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. Good morning Trey. Trey thanks for the question. You are right diesel was the friends, but we managed our labor. We managed SG&A, we managed our efficiencies and other things that we believe have the capacity to endure actually quite well during the quarter. Trey what we are endeavoring to do and I think what you have seen in the quarter is we are building a business that has the ability and should be expected to outperform as we go through cycles. So to your point volume is going to be, where the volume is going to be, and volume was down 4% for the quarter, but we saw profitability going nicely up, but pricing is a big piece of that and that has been something that Martin Marietta has demonstrated, I think extraordinary skill around managing. We have a depleting resource. We want to make sure we are getting good value for it. We are also going to flex very carefully on the labor side and the other thing that I think you are seeing evidence of is we have been very thoughtful in the way that we deploy capital. So I think if we look at the CapEx has done relative to our ability to continue to gain efficiencies that has been an important piece of it. One thing that I would call out to you in particular and really the comments I just gave you went specifically to the aggregates business. But I think two, if we look at our cement business, that also saw down volumes for the quarter, we are seeing much better reliability numbers relative to our mid loading operation and hunter facilities as well. So what we are seeing across our footprint is profitability, improved efficiencies, improved costs in a number of dimensions, but we are also getting the price stray and that is something that matters. Sure Trey, happy to try to do that. And I'm with you. I mean, I don't think what we are saying today relative to outlook should be a surprise to anyone. I think it is actually a very consistent conversation we have been having. And if we look at it, volume is down 4% in aggregate for the quarter profits were up. So I think that gives you a sense of it. Here is how I would break down the end users as you think of it. Look infrastructure for the quarter was actually pretty steady. I think one of the questions is what will phase four stimulus look like because it is been well documented with gas taxes going down state clearly have had some degree of revenue challenges with respect to that particular dimension. It is fascinating to me to see where AASHTO is today, AASHTO to making an ask that there would be about $37 billion in the phase four stimulus that would go directly to state DOTs. If that happens, I have to tell you state DOTs are going to probably be in a pretty good place. What I have tried to do with the prepared remarks too to give you a sense of where are our top three state DOTs, even irrespective of that may come from some form of COVID stimulus. And I think what you have heard is Texas DOTs in a pretty good place, Colorado DOT is going to use certificates of participation to help themselves out. And NCDOT despite having more challenges and those other two, I will tell you DOT we feel a lot better about today than we did when we were talking to in the first quarter. But there is now FY 2021 bedding are estimated there to 1.3 million that is really similar to 2016 level and well above that we have seen before is about a $600 million estimate. So, I think DOT and infrastructure is going to be relatively steady. I think a lot hinges on that phase will look like. I think res is going to be up, I think res could be up relatively nicely in a number of markets. And I think the footprint that we have is going to help that pretty considerably. I think you are clearly going to see more single family housing activity than we have seen for a while. And here is an interesting Trey that is worth noting. Potential single family housing activities we look at it at least prospectively. During the run from 1990 to 2009, single family building comprised about 80% of what we are seeing in the housing market. Over the last several years, the last 10-years, it has been modestly less than 70% of that. So again, if we see single family housing moving in a more normalized fashion and we think we will - we think that is going to be a pretty attractive price. Non-res is likely to be the area in which you are going to see a bit more near-term softness and portions of it, and probably strength in others. So as we think about non-res, what I would suggest is as follows. Heavy non-res is likely to perform relatively well. What do I mean by that? What are we seeing more warehousing in data centers in the works? The answer is yes, I mean, are we seeing more work with Facebook in places like [indiscernible], yes. Are we seeing more work with Google? Yes, but are we seen more work with Amazon and others? Yes, we are. Do I think hospitality and retail shops may feel a little more near-term pressure? I think they probably will. But part of what you heard me say in the prepared commentary as well, is we have been very careful to build our business in ways that we feel like major commerce corridors will continue to grow in an outsized way. So I think we are positioned well for there. The other thing that I will say is the smallest piece of our business can rock and rail and actually had a pretty attractive quarter. And we started balance volume actually up and we are not surprised by that. We saw that principally in the Western United States. And we see that is something that is likely to be relatively stable to flat going forward. So again, Trey I will try to hit all four of those end users, but of course, infrastructure and non-res and res are the three big ones. You bet. Take care Trey. Kathryn thanks for the questions. So really, we are going to look at that in two different buckets. Well if you think about what reauthorization looks like. As a sudden prepared comments, we don't think that happens before September 30th. So we think they will probably use your longer term CR. That is nothing to be alarmed by the way. I don't think they are going to issue a longer term continuing resolutions, because they think it is going to last for a long time. I think they may put in place optically what would be a longer term continuing resolutions simply to continue giving states the confidence to keep running projects. I don't think, it means they slow down on coming up with reauthorized bill. So to your point there are two different starting points, Kathryn. Last July vicinity PW came out with unanimity around the $287 billion plan. And that is basically a very nice percentage increase of where we were relative to the FAST Act. Now to give you more recent issues, house C&I released their plan, that was $319 billion, that was a 41% increase over the FAST Act. In the near-term, this is at least worth considering. And that is the House Appropriations Subcommittee on transportation, housing and urban development. Passed legislation that would provide about $107 billion in resources for U.S. DOT for FY 2021 including almost $62 billion for the highway programs, that is up 33%. So one of the questions I think is a fair one is what does a CR look like? And so I think normally you are looking at a CR, that is probably flat for some period of time, as they work toward, but I think evidently will likely be an increased multiyear highway bill. So Kathryn to your point. Worst case, you have a CR is flat. Best case, you have a CR that actually has some growth to it. I think expected case issue get a bill next year that is a nice increase several credit for the FAST Act does. And I equally think the conversations that have been had recently, relative to Phase 4 stimulus have not as to fear like the likelihood of seeing some very direct assistance. Going to state DOTs is actually better than we would have thought properly, when we were having this conversation three months ago. And again, the AASHTO asked there is around $30 billion. So I have tried to outline what I think the subs are, and I have tried to handicap where I think they sit. You know, I don't think end use is going to be a big driver and what we see relative to price increases. It is fascinating , for example, if you have got a single a home builder and they're coming through, they're probably buying stone at this price, which is frankly a pretty high price as things go generally. But I would think if you are seeing just standard growth along those different end users, and you are seeing in Southeast and Southwest, and clearly you have got higher ASPs in the Southeast right now from doing southwest you might have some geographic mix issues if you come from that. But from a margin perspective or from a pricing increase perspective, I wouldn't expect to see anything that would be particularly notable in any of that. I think the primary thing that you are going to continue to see is good, steady price increases, because I think that is something that would just recognize the value of, and we have locations that put us in a position that we can get the value that we need for our shareholders. Thank you Kathryn. Yes, I guess I would say several things. The primary driver so far has really been product mix and geographic mix. Just be clear on that. And when we are talking about delays, we are not talking about delays that were more than in the 45-day or 60-day range. And typically the delay and the number you had it late, you didn't have to lay in the number. And it happened really quite sporadically. I want to say it happened in probably two or three different sub markets. So I didn't view it as anything that made me feel remarkably different about the way the pricing situation works. The primary people who I would say pushed to at least see some deferment. If you recall in the earliest, earliest stages of COVID homebuilders in some instances were just walking away from subdivisions and taking about a 60-day to 90-day time out. I think in some of those instances, they were really afraid and looking for some immediate help. And I think some competitors and some instances did that. I think in some instances too, you had some readymix concrete producers who were looking for some lower inputs. Frankly we were not inclined to meet those. And we probably brought some modest share in some places, we have certainly done that before in cement. But again, we very have a value over volume philosophy that we bring to this. So from our perspective, Anthony, the delays were immaterial, but at the same time we try to be resilient through this. No. I think in many respect, if you looked at the commentary that I gave on geography in the prepared remarks that is probably a pretty fair way to think of it in the second half as well. What is interesting to me Anthony is we put up a record first half and a record second quarter. And actually one of the areas that had a tougher quarter was actually our mid Atlantic division and our mid Atlantic division has both higher average selling prices and higher profitability. So it tells me that the balance of the business is actually performing extraordinarily well. We see good business right now in Texas. We see good business in Colorado, we see business in portions of the central United States. We are seeing, I think, good solid business in Florida. And we think all of those will persist for the balance of the year. We are actually seeing very good businesses in cement in Texas right now, as well. The first stage obviously really we are more geared toward aggregates. Obviously, the only hot mix business we have is in Colorado it is a very, very good first half we think it is going to have a good second half as well. And then Magnesia Specialties, it is fascinating when we say that businesses is hitting an air pocket right now, I think that is what it is. We think steel found bottom actually in June. We think it is going to slowly get better. We are not seeing a huge bounce back in Magnesia Specialties in the second half of the year, but even in a challenge, first half, it had margins of 37%. So I think that gives you a pretty good snapshot of ags, cement, the downstream business and the Magnesia Specialties as well. Thank you Anthony. Now, I'm happy to try to do that. Look obviously, energy was a piece of that. It wasn't everything, but it was a nice piece of it. I think controlling labor was a piece of it. I still think you can do that with greater efficiencies in some place. I do think overall efficiencies by the way and we are a piece on it. And we talked about the fact that we are seeing much higher efficiencies in our cement business, all that stuff we have seen nice improvement. Over time it goes Midlothian and Hunter so that that is certainly going to help. The other thing that I will say Jerry and I mentioned that in the prepared comments and it is in our released today as well. This was an extraordinary safe quarter. And I think safety and you have heard us speak to that as a core value of this business, drives increased efficiencies and simply makes your business better and makes your people better. And from we are sitting here and happier with total injury incident rates and loss time incident rates, both exceeding world class standards. I think that really speaks to how teams are operating. The other thing that I will say relative to efficiencies is we have been very careful with how we have looked at capital allocation and CapEx over the last several years. And I think we are starting to see some of the efficiencies from that as well, which is one of the reasons that we are not at all shy, for example, to take the midpoint of the guidance that we have given relative CapEx this year. And as I think you saw, we have taken that up by about $25 million. So Jerry I wish I could point to one thing and say, this is it, I think it is a series of things. And I think when we go back to the notion that our aim is to continue to build an increasingly better business, they can go through cycles and outperform in any of those. I think that is what we are seeing. Sure I can and If we think about asphalt and paving Jerry, the nice thing from our perspective is the only question we have that businesses in Colorado. And last year as you will recall Jerry, they had a very weather impacted here. So they came into the year with very attractive backlogs. But again, we are seeing very good efficiencies. The asphalt and to paving we have is really running from Northern Colorado through Denver, down to Southern Colorado. We have actually seen bidding opportunities accelerated in an outpacing here in June, after a slow first half relative to bidding activity. What is odd, in many respects, is if we are looking out farther. I think generally, we feel better about the business today, for example, than we did even after Q1. So if we are looking at asphalt pricing liquid itself is about $420, that is down about 5% per ton. We think liquids going to remain in that range. We think our bidding opportunities are going to stay attractive. We think we have got a very good business in Colorado. And of course, one of the tricky things in Colorado is making sure that you are in a position to get good quality specifications stone, and we are in a position to start supplying with that. So we feel good about that asphalt and paving business and of course it had a very attractive first half. With respect to readymix concrete they had good first half too, I mean the downstream businesses performed really quite well, if you are looking like-for-like volumes. readymix was 8.7% keeping in mind that is really pulling that ArkLaTex business out. If you are trying to look at it geographically, in Colorado, where we have readymix, those volumes are up a little bit more than 14%. If we are looking in Texas, which is the other place that we have had that particular business, they were up around 6.2%. And again, part of what we are seeing is much better efficiencies in that business, delivery, costs and efficiencies are better. And again, these are not big surprises to us and we think many of these to your point are sustainable as well Jerry. You know part of that, I think is something on that is aggregates and cement in those markets. Aggregates in cement in Texas, and aggregates in Colorado, which obviously we saw supply are going up. And when you are see the input costs, at least in my experience, in readymix going up, those tend to be very helpful actually to the downstream businesses, and we are very mindful of that. Thank you Jerry. Thank you Paul. Paul thanks for the question. That is a good one, because if you look at our capital allocation priorities, we have long said the right deal is our number one priority. And I will say several things. One, I think our teams do an extraordinary job on transaction identification. I think they also do an extraordinary job on going through the transaction and looking at where we can get synergies. In our operating teams if you go back and look at whether it is [CXI] (Ph) or bluegrass, or the transactions in Colorado or otherwise have outperformed relative to synergies, that is a long way of saying that we remain very focused on growing our business. When we look at growing their business, we are focused on two things in particular, what is the geography and what are the end uses? It is an aggregate sled business but we are keenly focused on player, because the player really dictates how a business is going to perform. And a good example of that is we have had very good performance in Texas. You also saw very good performance in Colorado, but equally we are having great performance in the central which is just down, so we are seeing great performance all the way across. Relative to share buy backs and otherwise, I think the primary thing that we are waiting for right now, Paul is just some modest visibility forward on what is going to happen, particularly with respect to some of these government elections. I think we will have much better sense very soon. First going to have on Phase 4, I think what happens with Phase 4, it is going to give us a much better sense of how the infrastructure piece is going to look. So I think we are just a couple of pieces of information away from being able to really buybacks and otherwise. But please remember our primary aim is the right transaction going forward. Number two, assuring that we are investing in the business in a responsible way and you have actually seen us take CapEx midpoint up $25 million and then returning cash to shareholders through two different ways, a meaningful and sustainable dividend and our Board will obviously look at our dividend in August. So there will be here next month and they will look at that and then relative to share buy backs. I think we have touched base on that Paul. There are not a lot of distress opportunities per say out there, because particularly in the aggregates business, they tend to have pretty healthy balance sheets today. The family businesses are in pretty good shape. Our view has long been that succession tends to be a bigger driver of potential transactions in aggregates than been not. So I don't want to give you a sense that there are people who are in trouble and they are knocking down our doors right now that would not be accurate, but there are plenty of ordinary, typical and sensible transactions that we are looking at by now Paul. Thank you. Yes, as we think about the back half 2020, I think to your point a lot can hinge on what does Q4 looks like, frankly from a weather perspective. But it is interesting, if we look at our commentary, much of what happened in the first half with some of that COVID related sure it was more of that in half one weather related in COVID. Probably so. If we look at backlogs it is interesting to me if we look at Mid-Atlantic, customer backlogs are actually up around 17%. If we look in Southwest, customer backlogs where up around 30. If we look into cement, and this is a big one, I mean, there have been around 43%. At the same time, if we look at readymix, those are down in the low double digits, but at the same time we are seeing those backlogs improve in Q3 particularly related to infrastructure. And if we look into West, we are seeing backlogs down in the low double digits of very high backlogs coming into the year because of the way that weather had been last year.  So I think in many respects, we are sensitive to where will states be with their safe funding, and their revenues as we enter half to end they are feeling potentially in some respects, more COVID pressure than they felt so far. Number one. Number two, what is going to happen to portions of non-res meaning particularly what happens to that that lighter piece of it? Look, obviously if we see some stimulus come through infrastructure is going to be in a pretty good place, but if we look at Q2, with volume down for, that to me feels like modest volume down, that feels like a normal typical cyclical reaction design. And I think as we are looking at three and we are looking at four, four can obviously weather affected, but again I think if we are just looking overall at what has happening in the United States, and what is happening globally for us to put our heads in the sand and say that there is not at least an opportunity for something that does not feel like the cycle did in the great recession, not at all. But could feel a bit like this quarter did, particularly as we go into Q3, which last year, as you will recall Phil, was a really big quarter for us. So you have got a tough compare. You know I think the commentary that you have offered is probably right. Thanks so much Phil. The fact is we are a Southeast, Southwest driven business, we are not in downtown Chicago, we are not in downtown Manhattan. So the business - that are growing tend to grow out. They don't tend as much to grow up, if you know what I mean. And the other thing that I will say and we said it in the prepared remarks is we have been very focused on moving our business intentionally over the last decade, so that we are more focused on these heavy non-res projects. If we look at the way non-res is held up, it has been in the high 30% of our business. If we look at really what that look like over a longer term, it ought to be closer to 30%. That is where it has been. Infrastructure should be more as a percentage than we have seen over the last several years, non-res candidly should be modestly less. We think we may see some of that, but equally as we look at the heavy projects that are really taking up a good bit of our time right now. We are seeing very attractive increasing bidding in that respect. I'm not sure that it totally offsets, but the life side of it could be but I think it is a nice counterbalance to it. You bet Phil. Seldon, one thing, just from a color perspective, I will add to that. I think it is really important to underscore this. The recovery that ended with COVID was not a construction led recovery. And we have not seen that before in your lifetime or mine. And the fact is, we look particularly for housing is and the throughout the birth economy is required. We actually see a lot of things that lead us to believe that the post COVID recovery can and likely should be building led. The other thing that I would pointed out on Jim's commentary that was just entirely correct, is we are seeing nice price with volume down and with energy down. Oftentimes when we see energy going up, we actually see that as something that helps push ASPs up as well. So I wanted to make sure that we share that with you. Well, I think primarily, as I mentioned before, cement is being really resilient right now. I think we anticipate readymix continuing to be quite resilient, I think, and it is going to have a good year in the primary thing that we are speaking about and most of our commentary tends to be around aggregates and where that is going to be near-term and over the next few quarters. So that is how I would ask you to think about it right now so. You bet. Yes. I think it is two things, I think it is what kind of volume look and where the volumes look right. And I think part of what you are probably looking at and you are pleased with. I know I'm looking at and I'm pleased with it, is to see margin expansion despite the fact Mid-Atlantic had volumes down pretty considerably. So I think part of what I would ask you to keep in mind is Mid-Atlantic particularly with some of the headwinds that NCDOT has right now. We will probably have a more challenged year-over-year volume than other parts of the business. And again, that is a very high margin part of our business. So what you are seeing is great improvement in other parts of the business, we are seeing DOT in North Carolina putting itself in a position that really is we start getting into next year. It is going to look and feel a lot more normal relative to what history has been. But I do think that geographic mixed issue is one that you understand and it is worth noting. Yes. actually that is a great question Garik. And here is what I would say. We don't send significant volumes to West Texas. Clearly the biggest volumes that we have will be in DFW and in San Antonio and then those related markets. So if we go back and look I want to say full-year last year, you are probably looking at 30,000 or 40,000 tons of what's gone into West Texas those would not have been notable numbers. If you look purely at pricing though, here is what is worth noting. ASPs in West Texas are $200. If we look at really what the numbers look like in North, Texas and Central, we were seeing price increases in the range of around 4% Garik. So if you are seeing a 4% price there and you are getting back to the numbers that you would have expected, it is not the $8 going into the year, but if we are looking at overall same-on-same 4% price up in cement in Texas with down volumes that is a pretty good number. So if you look at more profitability, volumes down price up, actually much better efficiencies. And the other thing to keep in mind Garik is we actually anticipate having less - downtime and maintenance spend on terms this year than we did last year. We think it is probably going to be about $7 million less in 2020 than it was in 2019. So when you really stack up the issues relative to the cement business, we think it is pretty attractive. And Garik you were there at the time too. You will remember that one of the things that we thought was possible was to have particular pricing in cement in Texas, look overtime, at least relative to a stability perspective, more like aggregate pricing debt. And I think that is exactly what we saw in this quarter. And as you also know, we have been willing when we needed to give up share in that marketplace to continue to be resilient in pricing. So if we go back to 2014, we had a 22% share in that market. If we look at it today based on contract numbers, we are at about 19%, but pricing is behaving in profitability is going up. Garik does that help? You bet. Yes, private demand is pretty good. I mean, look housing is good in the state and it is going to be good in the state, private non-res is good in the state. It varies by geography. Charlotte's actually having a pretty good year. Raleigh Durham is having a pretty good year. Greensboro is not having a year but Raleigh Durham Chapel Hill is happening is happening the year that Charlotte had. And going to it was actually from an ASP perspective, a very attractive market for us. But the private is holding up pretty well in part because Josh has held up reasonably well here Adam. And look at the end of the day you got a lot of people moving to North Carolina and population is always going to be your single biggest driver of aggregate consumption. Actually, we didn't see any aggregate exposure in Austin. We sold some businesses called ArkLaTex. And so the only thing we did in Austin is we sold a depleted standing gravel location. So that that was purely an excess property. And that is what Jim was referencing, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a depleted site for $100 million. So actually I have to tell you from the way we look at that, that is a really nice win. So we did not get rid of any aggregates that were there. And again, back to your point, if we are looking at backlogs and asked specifically about Texas, Southwest backlogs are up about 30%. And if we looked into cement, they are up about 43% and if we look in readymix, they are down low double-digits but actually somewhat recovering right now due to some Q3 building activity. You are welcome Adam. Yes, I think two things Stanley. One, I think if you really get some significant phase for stimulus there is - the zip code of what AASHTO looking in for that 37 billion, and it is going directly to state DOTs. I think that is actually a really important amount of money that would fill a hole. So we will begin with that. I think to your second point relative to the CR, I think you raised a really good point. And I think part of what happened in the last downturn and you will remember it well Stanley because you are watching it, the CRs in that ended up oftentimes being very short-term, and that is why I made the comment earlier, people shouldn't be surprised, if you see out of the box, a long-term CR. And a long-term CR does not mean it is going to be in place for long-term, is simply done to make sure states continue to know that they can plan longer term as Congress goes about the process of probably having a conference and then coming up with a new infrastructure bill. So I think to your point, yes, I think this does feel better than last time, because I think whatever CR going to go in will be longer. I think whatever highway bill we get out will be larger. And I think one of your swing factors is brought to space for look like relative to A to the space. And I think we will know that here in the next - I think by the end of August, we will have a pretty good feel for what that is going to look like. And we don't see that having an effect good better otherwise on ASP. We think ASPs just all is going to behave well. Thanks Stanley. You know what, I don't think you would see a big movement in that particularly David. The only things that I think that may be different in that. I think housing might be a bigger piece of our pie, maybe for the foreseeable future than it would have historically. So if you think about it- David, if we looked at those numbers a decade plus ago, just the numbers very similar to what you just said, probably 45% of prospective 30% non-res probably low-teens, residential and then the rest would be ChemRock and Rail. I think res can stay elevated for a while, I think that is actually going to be good for us. Because I do think depending on the type of res, you know that could actually be good for ASPs. And I think the more single family housing that we see that it is going to be helpful. But again, I think that might help a little bit on the margin side. But overall, I think the margins that you have seen are - I don't think that was going to be end use driven. You know I don't know that we had that per se. One thing I'm happy to tell you is we saw pricing in Maryland, up around 6.4%. So if you are looking to glean, we are getting some nice synergies from that in Bluegrass, we are. But I would really rather not go back and break up what that looks like. Because it is so integrated into our business particularly in places like Georgia today, but it gives you a good snapshot of what the Maryland business that really had very little synergy brought together, operationally has done relative to pricing. Thanks so much David. Yes. I guess what I would say is this Rohit, we have got two opportunities. We have got the opportunity to keep doing just what you saw in this quarter, and that is make the Martin Marietta that we have better. And I think that is what you saw in the quarter performance perspective. I think the other piece is we have got white space on the map that we can continue to move toward. And what I mean by that is, we have talked a lot, whether it was in sort of 2020 and you will hear in sort of 2025, where people are going is going to be what drives aggregate consumption and the mega regions across the United States is where people are going to be living. And we have demonstrated that obviously in an aggregates sled business we can continue to expand margin. So product what I liked about the Martin Marietta story is we have turned this business into one of the great aggregates companies in the world. I think it is one of the great materials companies in the world. We can continue to make it better and we can continue to grow it. And that is something that if I'm you, I would continue to expect Martin Marietta to do. And I would just say, go back and look at sort of 2020, and we have given you a pretty good roadmap of places that we would like to grow. The other thing that I would say relative to rebalancing when you look at a decade that went from one or two and 65% of our markets at the beginning of the decade to one or two and 90% of our markets by the end of the decade, also, we were looking for that leading position in markets that we find attractive. So we don't feel like in our heritage footprint, that there is an enormous amount of work to be done. There are some careful work to be done on occasion. And an example of that would be what we discussed earlier and that is the sale of the ArkLaTex ready-mix business. We didn't find that particularly a great fit for our aggregates led in Texas and so we pruned that. But that is the type of work that you should expect on the heritage portfolio. And you should expect us to continue to look to grow in new markets where we can find our way to one or two. Alright. Thank you Rohit. Mike that is a great question thank you for it. It is funny how timing works, we started talking to our Board, literally last August about the restructuring that was announced, that was effective on July 1, of this year. And what we did is we just - down some of our aggregate divisions. So what we have now is a Western division that is run out of Denver, we have a Southwest division that is run out of Dallas. We have an East division that is run here in Raleigh. And we have a Central division that is run out of Indianapolis and then we have our Magnesia Specialties business as well. So the retirements are part of that, where efficiencies are part of that, and it is the ability for that structure to endure to get people whether they are division presence, [PPGMs] (Ph), or otherwise, expanded responsibilities and growth in their careers, all of those things help drive decision. The nice thing is of course your benefit is you get efficiencies from it. And we were very fortuitous to be in a spot that this is what we were looking to do, even in a pre-COVID world, and then COVID comes along, and the very thoughtful planning that we had to your point as a part of sort of 2020 and as a part of sort of 2025 coalesced very nicely with a timing need, and it simply could not have worked better. Again thanks for that question. The fact is, as I tried to mention, whether at least for the quarter was probably more impactful than COVID was, but we would be naive to say that there wasn't a COVID effect out there. So, NCDOT feeling some degree of the rest pre-COVID, I'm sure they were. Are they feeling a little bit more postcode? Yes, they are. And so has that affected volumes, and with that particular department? It has. Has it affected some other DOTs and modest rates? To be sure it has. It is fairly effective some private businesses too. It is tough to fully quantify exactly what that is. But I do think people recognize how to live and how to work with this. And part of what has been interesting to me as we have operated all the way through this as an essential business and our nearly 9000 employee count, we have had about [90] (Ph) positive probate cases, the vast majority of which have gone home, recovered at home and come back to work. And we have only had literally a handful of what we have been able to identify as employee to employee COVID spread cases. So I think businesses, governments and others have learned how to work with us. It has clearly had an effect, it is going to have an effect for a period of time. I think the actual steward effect there become less, not more. And we will have to watch and see what the physical effects are, and how governmental stimulus works. Thank you Mike. Well what I would say a cement price increases will come out again next year. So our intention is to come out typically once a year and put the price increases then so there shouldn't be any more on price increases this year. If we are looking at what cadence is going to be you know right now, we are forecasting probably about $3.5 million or $3.6 million worth of outage costs. So these are outage processes, I think that is what you are asking about in Q3. We are looking at probably around 0.5 million of those in Q4. And if you tell you that we did in Q1 and Q2, that means our total count outage costs for the year will be in the zip code of around $19.5 million, and that is about $6.9 million less than we saw in 2019. The short answer is yes, we will. But we have got one important step that we need to do before we do that and that is, we need to present it to our Board of Directors. And that is exactly what management is going to do when the Board is here next month, or here in just a few weeks. And I'm sure as we come out later in the year and early next year. We can give you a much clearer picture of what our goals and intentions are on the SOAR 2025. You bet. Thanks. Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With our stead fast commitment to safety, cost discipline and operational excellence Martin Marietta has the right strategic priorities and best-in-class teams to responsibly navigate through these challenging times and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. We are moving forward with confidence and determination. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2020 results in just a few months. As always we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy."

            "content": "Thank you, Howard and good morning to everyone. It is worth highlighting that the enterprise achieved a second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. This is the highest EBITDA margin in the company's history. The driving force behind this accomplishment was the building materials, which achieved record second quarter products and service revenues of $1.1 billion, a 1% increase from the prior year quarter and gross profit of $359 million a 9% increase. Notably, all of our building materials product lines contributed to this record profitability. Solid pricing gains, production efficiencies and lower diesel fuel costs drove a 230 basis point improvement in aggregate product gross margin to 35.5% also an all time record. This was accomplished despite lower volumes, demonstrating the cost flexibility and resiliency of our aggregate led business. Our Texas cement operations benefited from improved kiln reliability, as well as lower raw material and fuel costs. Product gross margin of 39.7% expanded 210 basis points despite a nearly 3% decline in cement revenues. As we have mentioned, our targeted downstream businesses delivered outstanding operational performance during the quarter. Readymix concrete product gross margin improved 270 basis points to 10.6% driven by increased shipments, pricing improvements and lower delivery costs. Equally impressive, our Colorado asphalt and paving business established second quarter records both revenues and gross profit. Product revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business decreased 31% to $49 million, reflecting lower demand for chemicals and lime products. Lower revenues resulted in a 420 basis point reduction of product gross margin to 37.3% or we expect this business will face similar headwinds in the third quarter. A gross margin in the high-30s is in practice, and indicative of superb cost management. Consolidated SG&A expenses included $3 million for COVID-19 related expenses, which included enhancements to cleaning and safety protocols across our over 400 sites. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. We continue to balance our long standing disciplined, capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet, and preserving financial flexibility to further enhance shareholder value. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and consistently return of capital to shareholders, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile. Furthermore, capital expenditures are now expected in a range of $350 million to $375 million. A slight upward revision from the guidance provided last quarter, as U.S. businesses were in the early stages of responding to the pandemic. Our current priorities projects are expected to improve efficiencies, capacity and safety, all core principles in the foundation of a strong financial performance. While we typically invest in the business. We also look for appropriate opportunities to divest non-operating assets to maximize value. In this regard, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to sell 82 [indiscernible] location in Austin, Texas for nearly $100 million. Since our repurchase authorization was announced in February, 2015, we have returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of shared purchases and meaningful sustainment dividends. Share repurchases activity remains temporarily paused during the quarter. However, the purchases can resume at management's discretion. In May we repaid $300 million of floating rate notes that matured using proceeds for our first quarter bond issuance. The company has no additional bond maturity until July, 2024. We are confident in our balance sheet strengths, we have ample liquidity and financial flexibility to continue possibly growing our business. Net cash combined the nearly $970 million available on our existing developments facilities provided total liquidity of $1 billion as of the end of the quarter. Additionally, at a net debt EBITDA ratio of 2.2 times we renamed well within our target leverage range as of the end of the second quarter. With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard for his market trends commentary. Well, I think theoretically, it is possible. We don't anticipate that to be the case. So the pricing is one thing we can bank on. We get it every quarter. It is sustainable and it does flow to the bottom line. So that is the most powerful weapon in our quiver. And So we have got that growing force. Additionally, this quarter into the foreseeable few quarters, we have got lower diesel prices. So that benefited this year, this quarter, it will benefit next quarter, the rest of this year I think. So those are things that we are expecting. Otherwise this is blocking, tackling with watching your variable cost, making sure you are flexing. The theoretical question you are posing. I mean, if volume drops tremendously, of course, your fixed costs, the absorption isn't there, where you need it to be. And that is where you run into some headwinds, but we don't see that happening quite frankly. Hey Stan it is Jim. Our original levels as in both constant of slightly up from a year ago and question from Q1, but no outsize moves there. And so that is just roughly prefer study production levels to offset each shipment levels. So that is pretty even keel there's no shortage is in sight, so there is quite rebalances at the moment."

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  We would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.  We have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q1 2020 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. We will reference this information during today's call. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings.  Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, whose remarks will focus on the state of our business in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the actions we have and are taking and the strength of our positioning to manage the current environment. Jim Nickolas will then review our first quarter 2020 financial results and liquidity position, and then Ward will provide some closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow Ward's closing remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. First and foremost, we hope that you and your families are and remain safe and healthy as we confront the challenges and uncertainties presented by COVID-19.  I also want to extend my sincere gratitude to our Martin Marietta team. I'm tremendously proud of how everyone is working together to manage through this unprecedented time and how the character of our employees has shown through. Day after day, Martin Marietta employees are safely and resolutely meeting the critical needs of our customers. They're also supporting their local communities in both large and small ways donating vital supplies and equipment to health care workers and first responders, helping neighbors by picking up groceries and ensuring our colleagues are well cared for and safe. Our team has shown great courage, determination and resilience as we successfully meet our stakeholders' needs while never losing sight of our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, community and stewardship.  These values define us and our character. We look at these foundational principles to guide our daily and long-term actions and decisions, particularly during difficult times. Martin Marietta remains open as an essential business. That designation means we're continuing to provide heavy building materials and services to our customers even in those areas with shelter-in-place orders. Communities across the nation must maintain their vital infrastructure and we're working hard to support that objective in a safe, efficient and responsible way.  Through the end of April, our workforce, operations and supply chains have seen little disruption. We believe this is largely due to our company's decisive steps early to respond quickly to this pandemic, our domestic focused approach to sourcing supplies and materials and our expanded safety procedures, all of which are designed to protect Martin Marietta employees and the organizational health of the company.  During this pivotal time, our focus is threefold: communication, resource management and business continuity. We've implemented new robust protocols and practices, including remote working, social distancing and enhanced equipment and facility cleaning, consistent with guidelines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the medical professionals who partner with the industrial hygienist familiar with our operations. These protocols were updated on an ongoing basis as public experts provide additional guidance. We also established a COVID-19 Planning and Communications task force, canceled all nonessential business travel and in-person meetings and established contingency plans with respect to staffing, and we've been actively engaged enterprise-wide to enhance the substance and frequency of our communications to ensure the flow of the most accurate and timely information about our operations, thus enabling our employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to stay fully informed.  Our operations teams have shown considerable agility, flexibility and perseverance while keeping our business running smoothly. Among other things, they've taken timely and responsible steps to clean and disinfect their facilities, while carefully screening necessary third-party visitors to minimize any COVID-19 exposure. Thanks to their dedication and effectiveness, our company has adapted extraordinarily well.  Additionally, for our colleagues that typically work in doors in close proximity to one another, we're utilizing a combination of social distancing as well as work-from-home protocols. Our employees are dutifully meeting their job responsibilities and remaining fully accessible.  Importantly, whether working at an operating site, an office or remotely, our employees are empowered and encouraged to look out for one another. With our team's safe and employee engagement high, we can be attentive to our other stakeholders, our customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders and communities as we have an essential business to run.  As disclosed in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered strong first quarter financial and operational performance. Jim will discuss these results with you shortly. Let me first say that we're proud of these results, which underscore our commitment to operational excellence and to our disciplined strategies. While we had a promising start of what we believe would have been a record-setting 2020, we recognize this year will now be filled with an unprecedented level of uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and societal outcomes continue to unfold. Accordingly, while we remain confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance issued back in February.  We've not yet seen contractors and customers delaying or canceling building projects in a material way. While we typically do not comment on intra-quarter trends, these are atypical times. We're making an exception and as highlighted on our supplemental information Slides 13 and 14, we are sharing preliminary April shipment and pricing trends to provide greater transparency as to what we're now seeing in a COVID-19-impacted month.  Specifically, for the month of April, aggregate shipments remained elevated in most areas but did not match the near-record April 2019 volumes. We saw notable growth in North Texas, Colorado and Indiana. Cement shipments continue to be strong and are currently trending close to prior year levels. The one notable exception is oil well cement shipments as demand continues to decline due to volatile and historically low oil prices. Ready mixed concrete shipments are also trending near April 2019 levels, even as some homebuilders temporarily pause construction activity.  April revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business are $10 million lower than the comparable prior year period. Demand for our lime and periclase products has slowed dramatically as steel-producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers beginning in mid-March.  In terms of April pricing trends, aggregates pricing improved mid-single digits over April 2019 as announced increases were broadly implemented earlier in the year. Cement pricing is up, even with several competitors announcing plans to delay price increases until June 1. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were highly confident in realizing the full announced increase of $8 per ton implemented April 1, given overwhelming market support in a tight Texas cement environment.  Ready mixed concrete pricing is slightly higher than April 2019 levels. We'll have a clearer picture of ready mixed concrete pricing trends for the remainder of the year as the phased reopening of the Texas and Colorado economies unfold. Though ours is a basic and durable industry, it does not mean that we're immune to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Our economy is interconnected and dislocations in consumer behavior or other industries may impact Martin Marietta. As such, looking beyond April, we anticipate product demand will soften in the coming months, with the private sector feeling the effects sooner than the public sector. The timing, duration and extent of weaker demand levels are presently unknown. Infrastructure, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, is expected to be the most resilient of the company's 3 primary end uses in the near term. The vast majority of state departments of transportation are operational and continue to advertise and award projects. Nonetheless, we expect many state DOT budgets will face temporary headwinds from lower fuel taxes, tolls, user fees and other related revenue collections as much of the nation has been sheltered in place.  The impact of lower funding levels is expected to become more meaningful in the second half of 2020, absent congressional action and will vary considerably among the states. Florida DOT, for example, has accelerated over $2 billion of critical transportation projects to leverage construction efficiencies resulting from lower vehicle traffic, including closing additional travel lanes and performing more daytime hours work. To help mitigate state DOT funding risks, industry representatives are actively engaging with Congress to address surface transportation in the Phase 4 emergency relief and economic recovery COVID-19 legislation. The first recommendation is the federal backstop of nearly $50 billion in immediate flexible funding to offset the estimated 30% loss in state transportation revenues over the next 18 months. The second recommendation is the passage of a comprehensive major surface transportation reauthorization package. We believe our industry is better equipped than in recent history to execute on an infrastructure build given the backlog of fully designed projects.  Nonresidential construction activity on existing projects has broadly continued in most regions. However, many commercial projects and the engineering or planning stages are being delayed or canceled, particularly for office, retail and hospitality. Some industrial activity, on the other hand, is not expected to experience significant near-term disruption from COVID-19, warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to perform relatively well in the current environment, as businesses increase e-commerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services.  Similarly, large energy sector projects along the Gulf Coast of Texas that are already underway are expected to continue.  The residential market is expected to experience the most rapid and perhaps steepest decline from the impacts of COVID-19 as unemployment and general economic instability of home buyers and home developers to delay plans. However, in contrast to the Great Recession, we do not anticipate a prolonged period of reduced residential activity. Today's housing inventories remain near all-time lows despite notable population gains in Martin Marietta states and to benefit from historically low interest rates.  As we prepare for the secondary effects of the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we rely on our values-driven culture. As I emphasized earlier, the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders remains our top priority. With established protections in place to accomplish this, we're focused on our business priorities of generating cash flow, preserving liquidity and adjusting costs to align with product demand. Our team has developed extensive plans for a variety of economic scenarios, and we're ready to implement them with immediacy and integrity as warranted.  In addition to strengthening our balance sheet through a timely $500 million bond offering in early March, we've cut nonessential costs, reduced capital spending for discretionary projects and implemented hiring restrictions. We're tightening our belts and aligning our capacity with demand consistent with our commitment to being prudent stewards of shareholders' capital. We will reevaluate these actions as visibility improves.  Having the right strategy, making the right decisions at the right time, and being able to safely execute them does matter a lot. And Martin Marietta will do just that. We're well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to successfully manage through today's unprecedented environment and emerge more resilient and capable.  How so? First, Martin Marietta has a much stronger geographic and competitive position today compared with any previous downturn in our more than 25 years as a public company. This is noteworthy, considering we navigated through the Great Recession and remain profitable throughout, never suspended or cut a dividend and emerged with a healthy balance sheet. Today, we continue to generate record profitability on aggregate shipment levels much lower than our peak volumes in 2005, and with a geographic footprint that we've not only considerably expanded but also improved. Moreover, we continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategic plans, carefully positioning our business through aggregates-led expansion in high-growth markets with attractive fundamentals and leveraging strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. These strategic plans not only provide Martin Marietta with new growth platforms, but also opportunities to expand our footprint to complement existing operations and build critical mass. We now have leading positions in 90% of our markets, up from 65% a decade ago, which supports favorable pricing trends, economies of scale and cost flexibility.  Second, we have experienced teams with decades of collective industry knowledge and expertise. Together, their leadership and contributions have produced strong and sustained financial returns for Martin Marietta and our shareholders as recently demonstrated by our 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative shareholder return performance. This is largely the same leadership team that successfully formulated our operational response and prudently addressed our business needs during the Great Recession, the most challenging economic environment our industry ever experienced.  In uncertain evolving times, proven cycle tested leadership and experience is critical. In brief, Martin Marietta has the right strategies, priorities, experience and teams to responsibly manage us through these challenging times.  I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed financial review. Jim?\nJames Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. I will briefly highlight our first quarter results as well as provide a summary of our financial and liquidity positions, both of which support our near- and long-term strategies. As detailed in today's release, our first quarter financial and operational performance exceeded our expectations, particularly considering the record-setting prior year quarter that benefited from carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018. On a consolidated basis, total revenues increased 2% to $958 million, a first quarter record. Gross profit was relatively flat. Selling, general and administrative expenses improved 10 basis points as a percent of total revenues. Diluted earnings per share was $0.41 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, decreased 6% to $149 million.  The Building Materials business achieved record first quarter revenues. Across our geographic footprint, product demand trends remain strong, even in the Texas and North Georgia markets that experienced record or near-record precipitation levels. Aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete pricing also improved, with all divisions contributing to the solid growth, a testament to the strength of our markets, and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy. Building Materials gross profit improved slightly. Key takeaways include the following: aggregates product gross profit decreased $5 million, largely due to our quarterly update of inventory standard costs. Our per ton production costs have been trending downward over the last 12 months as cost control measures and operating efficiencies have their desired effect. All else equal, this would result in higher operating margins going forward. But in this quarter, it also resulted in a $4 million expense as we reflected the lower cost in our updated inventory valuation.  In contrast, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an $11 million inventory valuation adjustment to reflect the higher production costs experienced during the weather-impacted year in 2018. While this cumulative $15 million year-over-year inventory standard variance reduced quarterly product gross margin by 260 basis points, lower unit production costs will provide future benefits.  Cement product gross margin expanded 1,170 basis points driven by improved cost absorption from higher production levels as well as increased shipments to the San Antonio, Austin and Houston markets. Pricing gains, combined with lower maintenance and energy expenses also contributed to the improved margin.  Gross profit for the ready mixed concrete business declined $9 million. Pricing improvements and double-digit shipment growth in Colorado were more than offset by lower Texas volumes from record rainfall, delaying projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as well as increased raw material costs.  For the Magnesia Specialties business, product revenues decreased 13%, consistent with expectations as chemicals customers continue to reduce inventory levels for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. Notably, product gross margin improved 500 basis points despite lower revenues, driven by ongoing cost control measures and lower energy costs. We still currently anticipate the destocking trend of our chemicals customers to be transitory in nature.  Our consolidated results included several items that affect comparability with the prior year quarter. To provide additional clarity, we included a slide in the Q1 2020 supplemental information posted on our website that provides a normalized view of pretax earnings with the items affecting comparability removed from both current and prior year quarters. In addition to the aggregates inventory standard adjustments discussed earlier, these items also included $6 million of other nonoperating expenses to finance third-party railroad maintenance in exchange for a federal income tax benefit of approximately $7 million, which drove the low-income tax rate for the first quarter 2020. Lastly, we incurred a noncash expense of $2 million to implement a new paid time-off policy for our employees. As you will see on Slide 5, first quarter 2020 earnings before income tax, absent items affecting comparability, improved $15 million.  Moving on now to our capital structure. Throughout our history, Martin Marietta has operated with a growth mindset, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet to preserve our financial flexibility. As a result, we have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future. Given today's environment, that is an enviable place to be. We will continue to balance our long-standing, disciplined capital allocation priorities to maintain that flexibility. Our priorities remain value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile.  Our approach is intended to ensure our cash flows are sufficient for a range of scenarios. In today's uncertain environment, that range of scenarios is broader and actions to enhance cash flows and preserve liquidity are even more important. Before the extent of the economic disruption became better understood, we repurchased 211,000 shares during the first quarter. Since then, we have temporarily paused share repurchases. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and as circumstances change, we will revisit this pause in our share repurchase program.  To further bolster cash flows, as Ward mentioned, we are reducing our capital spending for discretionary projects. We now estimate full year capital expenditures will be $325 million to $350 million, down from our original guidance of $425 million to $475 million. We demonstrated our ability to pull back on capital spending in safe and prudent ways that did not damage the business in the long run during the Great Recession. We are doing that again now as appropriate.  We've strengthened the company's balance sheet and cash position with our timely bond offering in early March, issuing $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.5% coupon. Proceeds will be used to repay the $300 million of floating rate notes that mature later this month, with the bulk of the remaining cash preserved on the balance sheet.  Looking forward, as you can see in our supplemental information slides, after satisfying the May repayment, we will have no additional bond maturities for more than 4 years. We are confident in our liquidity position. Net cash, combined with the nearly $760 million available on our existing revolving facilities, provided total liquidity of approximately $880 million at the end of the quarter. Additionally, at 2.3x net debt to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA, we remain well within our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x at the end of the first quarter. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward for some closing comments.\nHoward Nye: Thanks, Jim. In summary, we are pleased with our solid first quarter performance and enhanced liquidity. In regards to our 2020 full year guidance, we will reinstate earnings guidance once we have sufficient visibility to do so. That said, we remain confident that the attractive underlying market fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends in our key geographies, both of which underpin the company's record 2019 performance and strong first quarter 2020 results, remain intact and will be evident once again as the U.S. economy stabilizes and recovers.  Martin Marietta is well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to responsibly navigate today's extraordinary environment and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move forward. We have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed on our strategic plans positioning our business as an aggregates leader in attractive high-growth geographies, aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities and prudently allocating capital while maintaining financial flexibility. In doing so, we have built a business that is durable, resilient and stronger than ever. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: So my first question is really around the state tax receipts that you mentioned being down, of course, and you talked about the possibility of 30% -- being down 30% or so over the next 18 months for DOT. Also, you got in the background, the FAST Act expiring this year. You guys have a lot more boots on the ground than most around this. So I wanted to get your opinion, first off, on how you think all this shakes out with some of the states are coming together and asking for, you mentioned the $50 billion there. But how do you think this shakes out from where we sit today? And then as my follow-up, if we don't get anything from the Fed to bridge the gap, when would that start to impact state lettings and then ultimately, aggregates demand?\nHoward Nye: Great. Thanks for your question. Look, I think a couple of things are worth noting. To your point, AASHTO is the one that has come out and asked for the $50 billion infusion from the federal government to states. And again, you're exactly right. That's taking into account that they are seeing something that could be a 30% delta in gas tax collections. So we'll see where that goes from the federal perspective. That's probably going to take a few months to see. I think on a state-by-state basis, what you're likely to see, Trey, our states are going to have to come back and their legislatures are going to have to address funding for different DOTs.  And I think that's going to vary pretty considerably. If we look at Texas, which is our largest state by revenue, their DOTs are in a pretty healthy place. And they've got a very healthy rainy day fund. They're indicating, for example, that they don't see a need go to that during this first year. So the fact is, depending on how revenues come in, places like TxDOT may not need to go there at all. States like Colorado, which is our second largest by revenue, have the ability should their treasurer choose to issue certificates of participation and we think those types of levers, you can keep Colorado DOT in a very good place. North Carolina DOT is in a similar spot. We've discussed the fact historically that they've had some storm issues that they needed to manage through and they had some issues relative to some litigation, commonly referred to as the Map Act. COVID-19 has made that a bit more complicated for North Carolina DOT. The legislature is in session. They are looking at several things that they can do in that state. One thing that's worth noting, and of course, it's here in our backyard, we actually, over the last couple of years, have been very successful in bidding on work here in North Carolina. So for example, one of your concerns is what would tonnage look like going forward, we booked over 10 million tons of aggregates on 6 large NCDOT projects in North Carolina.  And we've only shipped about 600,000 of that 10 million. So to your point, could different states feel different degrees of pressure, they probably will. Do we think Southeastern and Southwestern states that tend to be our leading states will come through that better than most? We think so. Do we think existing projects that are underway will continue going? I think the answer to that is, we believe strongly that, that will be the case. And I think you could see some instances in the second half of people looking at bidding activity a little bit more carefully, particularly relative to maintenance in public. But again, Trey, we see this as being pretty steady and pretty resilient, and there will be some one-offs here or there and legislatures will need to endeavor to deal with it. And we think we will likely get some help from the federal government. The last thing that I'll add to it is I do think this gives increased impetus as we said in the prepared remarks, toward getting a successor to the FAST Act.  My view has long been that the Senate plan is likely to be the one that will be pushed forward. As you recall, that's a $287 billion, 5-year plan that basically is looking at a pretty significant increase of our FAST Act funding levels. So we feel like that would be a very worthwhile and useful endeavor for our friends in Washington.\nTrey Grooms: Thank you for the color on that, Ward. And my second question is on just pricing. Aggs historically has been very resilient through downturns. Do you see anything in your markets? Or do you think anything has changed to where that wouldn't be the case if volume was to drop significantly?\nHoward Nye: Look, I think the markets are better suited today than they were last time and they did great last time. And I don't see anything that gives me any concerns around the aggregates pricing thesis. I think that works. If you look at the quarter, you can look at our quarter and say the numbers were a little lower than we thought. The fact is we saw really big increases in volume in our Central division and our West division. And our Central division has an ASP as just our West division that are lower than corporate-wide ASPs. So I would not let Q1 pricing give you any degree of concern around the overall thesis. As you could tell from our supplemental materials, once you got into April, you saw pricing with a 4 handle in front of it. The other thing that I would say, Trey, is I think you will see greater resilience in cement, particularly in our business in Texas as well this year. We think we're going to continue despite these recent trends with COVID-19 to see good solid price increases in Texas cement. So again, if we look at aggregates, no, I don't think anything has changed there. If anything, it's better. And I think cement is better as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research.\nKathryn Thompson: A follow-up on the North Carolina DOT. Could you confirm for those listening that the 10 million tons you outlined is funded? And could you give a little bit more color on the timing and flow through these tons?\nHoward Nye: Yes. No, the 10 million tons from everything that we have seen and gleaned, yes, is funded and we anticipate those projects will be going. They tend to be, though they're not wholly, in Eastern North Carolina, and they're going to be going through '20 and '21. So we see those projects as being certainly through the rest of this year and into next year, Kathryn.\nKathryn Thompson: Okay. And then a lot of different puts and takes on margins and appreciate the color you have both in your PowerPoint and prepared commentary today. But taking a step back could you give a little bit more color on a basis point standpoint or a dollar standpoint, the bridge on margins in the quarter? Also focusing on the geographic, what's geographic, what's onetime or any other factor that's relevant?\nHoward Nye: Sure. Absolutely, Kathryn. I'm going to give you a couple of broad side views on that and ask Jim to talk you through a more detailed review. As you could tell, what's always interesting to me is when we have an inventory variation and it goes down. People who are uninformed will look at that and be troubled by it. Actually, that's something that we celebrate inside because it actually means our costs are going down, which is exactly what you want and exactly what our shareholders want. So what we saw in part was a change in inventory because our costs were getting better. Part of what we can talk through as well is a certain degree of geographic mix shift that we saw change. For example, our Central division saw volumes up over 20% in the quarter. Our West division saw volumes up over 15% in the quarter. And to give you a sense of it, central ASPs are in the mid-12s as our western ASPs and you look at overall ASPs at 14.80. So when you go through that, you start to get a sense of what could be modestly different as you go through a bridge in a quarter that remember, is our lowest volume quarter. So things can feel oversized in that. What I'll tell you is the more you look at this quarter, the more you're going to like this quarter, and let me turn it over to Jim. He can walk you through while I feel that way.\nJames Nickolas: Yes. Thanks, Ward. So we -- Kathryn, we put in the supplemental slides that walk. Walking folks from the Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year simply to help illustrate the improved quality of earnings this year versus last year. So kind of to put numbers to the descriptions that Ward just gave, the inventory revaluation item, that was $15 million that by itself is equivalent to 60 incremental margin basis points. In addition, the geographic mix from a margin perspective was about $10 million. So that's about 40 incremental margin basis points. A couple other items.  We had increased production. So our cost absorption was very good. That was slightly offset but not wholly offset by higher freight costs. So those 2 combined, netted out to about 8 basis points you would add back. And then lastly, diesel is a tailwind for the quarter. And if you want to pull that out to kind of keep it normalized, that equates to about 60 million -- sorry, 16 basis points. From an incremental perspective, it was $4 million. So the puts and takes, if you add all that up, the ins, the outs gets us to right around 55% to 60% incremental margin.\nHoward Nye: Kathryn, that was a lot of math and a lot of color, but I hope that helped.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: I wanted to ask on your view on margins moving forward, specifically decremental margins. I mean you tend to deliver about 60% aggregate incrementals in an upcycle, but given potential volume declines over the next several quarters, how should we think about decremental margins moving forward?\nJames Nickolas: Yes. I think theoretically, it should be the same going down as it is going up. We will endeavor to do better than that. We've got cost-reduction plans ready to go. If things get materially worse, we don't see it getting surely worse necessarily, but we're ready for that. So I think for now, it's probably safest to assume a symmetrical approach going up and going down.\nHoward Nye: But Garik, what you should expect is just what Jim said. And in prepared comments, we said we are going to adjust costs as we go through a volume profile as well. I think part of what's important to remember is what we outlined, this is a business that was always profitable and never cut a dividend. And I think we can surprise in any marketplace today.\nGarik Shmois: Okay. Follow-up question is on nonres. Can you remind us how much of your nonres is split between the more cyclical office retail piece that you cited is expected to be softer in the coming months versus the heavy nonres that is holding up a bit better?\nHoward Nye: I'm going to give you a historic, and I'm going to give you a closer to real time. So historic, in a normal time, you would have expected about 30% of our business to have been nonres. You would have expected about half of that 30% or 15% to be heavy. You would have expected about 15% of it to have been lighter, meaning more office, retail, et cetera. Actually, what we've seen is it's trended modestly more toward heavy. And you can imagine why because more people are shopping behind a keyboard as opposed to in a shopping center. So while housing has been relatively good, retail, that typically would have fallen housing, has not been as robust and it shifted more toward warehousing and the Amazonation of United States.  And that's actually something that we've benefited from. So what I would say, Garik, is if you look historically at a phase, say, that ended at the first -- at the end of the first quarter, you would have expected a bigger piece of that than really we've seen being office and retail. It tends to be modestly more heavy today. If we go into a deeper government-mandated recession, and that's how I like to think about this one, you could certainly see the heavy side of it being a larger percentage. But at least historically, that's where it's been, that's where it is as we finish the first quarter and we finished April. And as we think about what it could look like going forward, we tried to outline in the prepared remarks that it could be that light side of nonres that could feel some components of that earlier rather than later. So it's going to be, call it, probably low double digits.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.\nPhilip Ng: Glad to hear Texas cement pricing seems quite robust, and your expectation was to get the full $8.\nHoward Nye: No, no, no...\nPhilip Ng: Initially. Initially, before COVID\nHoward Nye: Okay.\nPhilip Ng: So that's a good place. And that market has obviously been undersupplied for some time now. The color that you provided in deck in April, it looks like pretty good momentum there. How much of that's incremental pricing versus carryover pricing? And then this is a higher fixed cost business, how should we think about decrementals for cement?\nHoward Nye: I think cement is going to hang in there pretty well. I mean what I would say back to your first part on pricing. I mean obviously we came into the year feeling very good about pricing, feeling very good about the 8 up until COVID. I still think we're going to get price increases in Texas. And that ties back into the commentary that we have overall on aggregate pricing thesis being very tight, cement actually getting better. In fairness, Phil, I think pricing is going to be better in the north than it's going to be in the south, but I think you're going to get it in both places. And again, I think we're -- you're going to see very good cost control in cement this year.  For example, if we're looking at our kiln maintenance expenses year-over-year, we're anticipating that they're going to be about $7.6 million less in '20 than they were in '19. Part of what you saw in Q1 is there are about $2.8 million less in Q1 of '20 than they were in '19. So it's hard to know exactly how to address the margin issue there. You obviously saw very attractive margins for the first quarter. Because that business does have a higher fixed cost. But again, we've put over the last decade, about $1 billion worth of CapEx into that business. I think we've got cement plants in Texas that are close to state of the art. We're utilizing very different energy resources at that facility today that are reducing our costs. So we think our cost profile will be good. We think our pricing profile is getting better. And actually part of what we're liking too is I think if you're seeing good aggregate pricing, good cement pricing, you're likely to see a much more steady market relative to ready mix as well. So Phil, I've given you a lot of color around the way that, that business is operating now and what the change is year-over-year. And why we feel confident with that business as it sits. I hope that's helpful and responsive.\nPhilip Ng: That's super helpful. And then appreciate the deck where you gave us April trends, and this is not very scientific, just eyeballing. It looks like might be down mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Appreciate April, last year might have been like a record year. Any color on how April performed last year? And then any color on how we should think about the rest of the 2Q in terms of demand trends? I think Jim just mentioned that he's not expecting a material decline going forward. I just want to triangulate all that.\nHoward Nye: Yes. Look, what I'd tell you is last year in April was near-record April. So what I'll tell you is April, looking at these trends that you saw felt very good. And even if you look at those charts on, I guess, supplemental Slide 13, it shows a little bit of a dip in early April. And by the way, we call that Easter. So that's exactly what that was. So again, if you look last year at a near-record April, if you look at very solid volumes this year in April, if you look at a better pricing environment. And of course, part of what we spoke about earlier in the call, with the odd conversation on the inventories, is the cost profile is getting better. Look, it's hard not to triangulate around those three things and feel like you've got a very durable business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel.\nStanley Elliott: On the residential market, how quickly can -- if the economy start to reopen, people feel good about things or better about things, I guess, on a relative basis. How quickly can some of these residential projects get the green light to go ahead, i.e., could we end up seeing some of those volumes in the back part of the year?\nHoward Nye: Yes, I think you could. I mean let's look at it in two different ways, Stanley. Let's look at what the world looked like before the government-mandated recession. So housing was healthy through March. Permits were up 7.4% versus prior year. If we look states that matter to us, Texas was up 10.5%. Florida was up almost 11%, North Carolina was up almost 9%. So to your point, very healthy housing marketplace then comes down a series of shelter-in-place orders. And obviously, you see confidence turn pretty quickly from the end of the year when it was high. To what it felt like toward the end of March. Here's what I would say. If we look at regions that have declined and they all have, the Northeast has declined the most. The Midwest has declined next the most.  And then the one that has declined the least, to your point, has been the South. And if you think about where we have built our business, it's not exclusively, but it's largely a Southeast and Southwestern U.S. business. So what we would say is this, we think the south, clearly outperformed on the upside. We think the south is going to outperform on the downside. But equally, we think, if things get turned back on, that it will perform quite well. Here's part of what's different in this government-mandated recession versus prior one, Stanley, housing is not overbuilt. So if we look at population trends, and we again, noted that in the prepared remarks, population trends in North Carolina, populations trends in Georgia, Florida, Texas, Colorado, all states in which we have 1 or 2 positions, are very attractive population dynamics.  The other piece of it, Stanley, and this is one that I would ask you and your colleagues who spend time thinking about this to ponder. I think you're likely to see more people pivoting away from urban living and looking more to live in suburbs for a while. I think having some space is going to be something that people will gravitate towards. The other thing, and it pivots modestly away from your housing question, but I think it's relevant. I think as we think about what a Transportation Act is likely to look like in this next generation, I think it's going to be heavier on surface transportation and perhaps lighter on transit because suddenly, the notion of getting in trains or otherwise is going to be something I think people would be cautious of. So again, Stan, I'll try to answer your question very specifically, where were we pre-COVID? Where are we now? What did the percentages look like? Where do we think the comeback will be the quickest and some of the, I guess, color around the why.\nStanley Elliott: That's great. And on the cost side, I mean, look, I don't think it's going to be quite like 2009, but you all did a really nice job of taking the costs out. Could you -- with kind of what you have in place, could you look at SG&A being down on a year-over-year basis? And then also maybe as a reminder, could you tell us how much you all used in terms of diesel gallons last year?\nHoward Nye: Yes, certainly can. What I would say is this, look, we're always very sensitive to SG&A. And I think if you look at us compared to most of our peers and you look at our SG&A as a percent of revenue, you're going to be pretty impressed with where that is. What I would tell you is we will absolutely positively adjust that as we feel like we need to. So -- and I think our track record reveals, that's something that we will do. But importantly, Stanley, we'll do it in the right way. With respect to diesel fuel last year, we used right at -- I believe, it was right at 15 million gallons of diesel fuel last year. And for those of you who are wondering, we used a whopping 11.7 million gallons in the first quarter of 2020.\nStanley Elliott: Perfect. Appreciate it.\nHoward Nye: Good to hear your voice.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering, Ward, if you can just talk about, given the difference in the footprint, how we should think about pricing in this downturn compared to the Great Recession? Nice not to have the river system assets, and what we saw in the last cycle which was actually a pricing bottom after volumes did, and I'm wondering, given the change in the footprint. How are you folks managing your business potentially differently in this cycle compared to coming out of the Great Recession?\nHoward Nye: Yes. One of the things that I'm sensitive to, Jerry, to your point, is we've got a 1 or 2 position in 90% of our markets today. In the Great recession, we had a 1 or 2 position, 65% of our markets. Okay. So let's take -- let's talk a bit about what critical mass can mean. And I think critical mass and the dimension of your question, is our friend. I think equally, you raised a really good point, and that is we've been very thoughtful about geographic areas that we wanted to exit and geographic areas that we wanted to enter. And what we try to do is enter areas with high relative population growth and multiple economic drivers. So if we go back and take a look at the way our SOAR plan has come together and dictated that we have 1 or 2 positions, it truly has dictated that we have landed where we have. I think the markets where we have these positions, they are far better than they were before.  I equally think from a local land use perspective, the barriers to entry are as high, candidly, probably higher today than they were before. If you think about even during the last several years and what I think most would say has been a relatively good economy in some of these sectors of the United States, you've not seen a great deal of greenfielding. And I think in a down economy, you see even less of that. The other thing that's important to remember, Jerry, is in construction, we're seldom going to be the reason that a contractor is either successful in getting a job or not successful in getting a job. And what I mean by that is this. Stone is about 10% of the cost of building road. It's about 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those 2 percentages on a nonresidential project. In other words, we are the product that's utterly essential for that project to go forward because there is no substitute, generally speaking, for what we do. At the same time, we're not going to make or break what's going on relative to the project. I think that's one reason that you saw aggregates do so well in the last downturn. My sense is, for all of those reasons you will see it do, in my view, better as we go through this period of time.\nJerry Revich: And Ward, if we're coming out of those and was the residential pickup happens as you laid out in '21 under that scenario if absolute construction activity bottoms, call it, fourth quarter of '20, first quarter of '21, given the market structure today, when would you expect aggregates pricing to reaccelerate under that scenario that I just laid out?\nHoward Nye: I think we will continue to be very consistent all the way through this, at least from a Martin Marietta perspective. Part of what we talked about historically, is -- you're right, it would either go up or the volume upwards slow with the price up would slow with volume. The fact is, Jerry, if you look over the last several years, it's never really worked that way. Actually, pricing, in some respects, has done better overall than volume has done, particularly in places where there's been some reasonable consolidations. So to your point, if we look at what ASPs have done in Colorado, on a percentage basis, they've gone up nicely ahead of aggregate volumes overall. So I think it's going to vary a lot by geographic region. But at the same time, this has proven itself not to behave in a down market as a commodity. So from our perspective, again, recognizing that we're a very small percentage of the overall costs, but we have a product in the ground that's more valuable tomorrow than it is today, we're going to approach pricing with that mindset.\nJerry Revich: So it doesn't sound like you think the 4% pricing in April is an outlier.\nHoward Nye: Right. No, not at all.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Paul Roger from Exane BNP Paribas.\nPaul Roger: You've talked a bit about the flexibility on the cost side. I wonder if you could talk a bit more on the cash flow side. And in particular, how much scope there might be to reduce working capital? And just linked to that, maybe also as a follow-up. Do you have any concerns on the receivables side?\nHoward Nye: If I may, Paul, I'll turn it over to Jim, and he'll take you through those. One of the nice things about -- I'll give you this one bit of color. One of the nice things about being a building material supplier is you either have lean rights on private jobs or you have bond rights on public jobs. So actually, ours is one of those sectors that tends to have more stable and collectible receivables than most. So with that as a preliminary background, let me turn the balance of the question over to Jim.\nJames Nickolas: Yes, thanks. It's something that we're mindful of and we're watchful of. As a macro matter, I will say, our receivables are backstopping our AR facility. So that is a natural offset. So we get the access to funds almost immediately. So the AR receivable is a great source of funds for us. And that's through our $400 million AR facility. And as far as it relates to bad debt expense or writing off those receivables, it has historically been a very, very, very small, I would call it, insignificant expense for us, averaging around $3 million per year at most. And so that's not something that I'm troubled by. We will, of course, monitor that and take action as needed. But it's a very, very small number, typically. So that's not an issue for us.\nPaul Roger: That's very clear. And just maybe as a quick follow-up. When you think more medium term about what is this crisis could do in terms of the structure of the industry? Do you think there's a potential that this puts a bit more pressure on some of the mom-and-pops so some of the smaller aggregate guys? And could it actually create opportunities for you to even potentially accelerate some of your source strategy?\nHoward Nye: It certainly could. What I'll tell you is most closely held businesses are probably in a pretty good place going into this downturn. My experience is it's more succession issues that tend to drive those decisions than it is near-term economic issues, but I'm not going to be naive and assume that there are not some people out there who may feel otherwise in that respect. One of the things that you'll see, if you look at our balance sheet is we're right at 2.3x debt to EBITDA. That's very much within the range that we like to stay. Paul, if you go back and take a look at where we were going into the Great Recession and what we look like coming out of the Great Recession, we did utilize that downturn to grow our business very, very responsibly. We continue to say that our best first dollar is in the right acquisition and emphasis on the word right. So we will continue to watch for that. We like to believe that we're going to be a preferred acquirer if businesses should come up. And we will watch that, and we will be very thoughtful about the way that we approach it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet.\nRyan Coyne: This is Ryan on for Mike. Can you just provide an update on funding in Texas, specifically in terms of what levels of oil prices mean for contributions to state transportation funding? And then similarly, what do you expect to occur on asphalt margins as inputs drop? Will pricing follow inputs lower?\nHoward Nye: No. Sure. Let me deal with the latter one first. If we go, the only place that we have asphalt is in Colorado, just as a reminder. And one of the great things about being in Colorado is you're not on either one of the coasts. So what it tells you is asphalt and liquid stays relatively steady as you go through it. So if we look at liquid costs as we went through Q1, they were really about $450 a ton. They've recently come closer to about $420 a ton. So we don't think we're going to see big variations in that Colorado market relative to liquid. One of the things that's worth knowing is if we look at our backlog in asphalt and paving, we've got about $100 million more in work year-to-date this year in April than we did in the prior year. So we've got a very attractive paving business in that marketplace, and we've got a cost structure that we think is going to be quite helpful to us as we go there. The other thing that we saw in Q1 is we saw some municipal work accelerated. And it's a practical matter for us, what happens is we bid on municipal work. Oftentimes, we negotiate private work.  So at times, you'll see a modestly lower selling price on the muni work simply because it's bid. So I just wanted to make sure that we talked through that. Back to your other question. Several things relative to TxDOT. If we look back over the last several years, going back to as late as 2017 and look at numbers that were awarded at TxDOT. In 2017, it was $5.1 billion. In 2018, it was $7.6 billion. In 2019, $8.9 billion. We've got a couple of different estimates right now, but the latest estimate I've seen for Texas is around $7.9 billion. So again, if you look at $7.9 billion and you look at what that -- how that racks up relative to history, that's not a bad place to be. The thing to remember on Prop 1 and Prop 7, and I think that was the gravamen of much of your question. Prop 1 allocates portions of oil and gas revenues to the State Highway fund through 2034. Prop 7 is -- really comes into play of sales and tax collections reached $28 billion.  And after that, the next $2.5 billion are transferred to DOT. We're going to have to watch and see how some of the Prop 1 and Prop 7 monies go. I think we haven't seen any big surprises coming from that so far. And that, in part, that's driven by what I had mentioned before, Texas has a $10 billion rainy day fund. And the Texas controller so far has indicated that the state can manage whatever revenue loss they've seen in this first year without having to go and tap in that rainy day fund. But in any event, we know a very robust fund is there. So several things. I'll try to give you what I think is responsive data relative to asphalt, liquid and paving in Colorado, give you a good sense of what total TxDOT current letting should look like over a period of years where those dollars have come from and where we think that is and the backstop of rainy day fund.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seldon Clarke from Deutsche Bank.\nSeldon Clarke: How do you think about the impact from mix as it relates to both revenue per unit and gross margins across the different construction end markets? Do the decrementals change across different end markets, whether it's infrastructure, commercial or resi?\nJames Nickolas: No. Not really. There's really -- again, from -- in our perspective, we're relatively agnostic in terms of ASP and profitability. They're pretty consistent.\nSeldon Clarke: Okay. And then just getting back to the oil and gas question for a second. Could you just give us a sense of what you think your direct exposure to the oil and gas complex is? And then realize this might be a little bit more difficult but -- to contextualize. But in your internal planning meetings or stress test scenarios, how do you think about your more indirect exposure to the oil and gas industry as well?\nHoward Nye: So thanks for the question. Here's the way I would respond to that. I guess several things. One, lower oil actually helps us on diesel pretty considerably. If we go back to the sheer volume of gallons that we burned through a year, 50 million gallons is not a small amount. So it helps us in that dimension. To your point, do we have some energy exposure relative to stone that we have sold to people traditionally in the shale fields? The answer is yes. If we go back and say, okay, what did that look like at absolute peak? At peak back in 2014, we sold 7.5 million tons to different shale producers who needed stone to build pads or internal roads. The absolute bottom of the cycle, we sold 1.4 million. And last year, we were 2.3 million.  And this year, we said we probably thought we'd be somewhere between 2.5 million and 3 million because we thought that was a pretty steady, steady run rate. So I would say that relative to those things. Now with respect to your other question, which is a good one, on the balance of some of nonres, if we think about those really large energy projects, not shale activity, but the shale -- but the large energy projects in South Texas. Here's what I would say. The first wave of those really has gone. There were total awards for about 7.9 million tons of aggregates and about 660,000 cubic yards of concrete. And of those 7.9 million, we won about 3.5 million tons of it. And that's consistent with what we've said. We said we weren't going to get all of that, but we would get our share of it.  And I think we certainly have. If we think about what the rest of this year is likely to look like, I think in 2020, we'll probably ship around 1 million tons during the course of the year to those different projects. And what that means is this, it means Port Arthur LNG, Golden Pass and some other large projects that are still down there on the books will likely be pushed out to the right just a little bit. And as a reminder, that's going to tally up to modestly over 14 million tons of aggregates coming forward in these projects over the course of time. So again, I've tried to address diesel cost and what that energy means to us in our business. I've tried to address what's going on in the shale fields, both at peak, trough last year, what we thought this year would be and when our overall view is on the large energy projects on the Gulf Coast.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor from Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: A question on the FAST Act and the expiration in September. And I know there's been a lot said and written about the likelihood of something like this is actually getting done before the election, which seems to be increasingly remote opinion to many. In which case, I guess, we're looking at a continuing resolution situation, just help me, with the continuing resolution, is it possible to get an increase in spending levels under continuing resolution? Or are you kind of locked in at existing levels?\nHoward Nye: No. I think the fact is if they agree to it, you could get an increase in. And actually, David, what's been interesting, that's exactly where we thought we were coming into the year. We anticipated that the most likely result in 2020 was to be in continuing resolution land until post-election. I do think it's going to be interesting to see if there's going to be a push to have a successor to the FAST Act before then. Because obviously, it does expire in September. I think the one thing that I would say is this, I think everyone learned from the experience a decade ago that short-term CRs are not good for anybody. They're not good for the government. They're not good for the states. They're not good for the contractors. And they're not good for the material suppliers. So I would say that I'm not sure that we're totally in a place that it's only going to be CRs. I think you might see something more at the Senate level as opposed to the House level, but they clearly -- if they wanted to take it up, they could.\nDavid MacGregor: Okay. And then also earlier in your comments on the call, you made reference to bidding activity in the second half of the year, and you thought that people would be looking at that a lot differently. Obviously, given the macro, I guess -- guess what you meant by that. But can you go back and elaborate on that a little further in terms of just how you see bidding activity unfolding over the balance of the year?\nHoward Nye: Well, I think we're -- our comments more geared toward private activity and what may or may not happen then. And I think much of it, David, is going to be dictated by how quickly we come out of some of these stay-at-home orders and how the economy, frankly, reacts to several things. I think that's going to be your driver. I think the light portion of nonres has historically proven itself to be the place that people can either turn on or turn off with greater precision than others. I think homebuilding, the same thing can be said there. If you look at what homebuilders have done, even during the last several weeks, many of them hit pause for a period of time. I think we certainly feel like they're going to come back and resume. But again, I think what we're trying to outline, David, is none of us have ever done this before. This is going to be a little bit different. The things that I think are going to be constant is, I think we're going to do really well on pricing. I think we're going to do really well on costs. I think we're going to get our share of business. I think the question is going to be exactly what will business on the private side look like. And I think if anybody can tell us that, that's somebody we'd all like to have on their payroll.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America.\nTimna Tanners: Ward, I really wanted your perspective on kind of the 3 different components of potential government support. So I know there was some discussion on FAST Act and continued resolution versus the replacement. But also you mentioned that AASHTO nearly $50 billion request. And there's, of course, never-ending waiting for the infrastructure stimulus potential. So if you look at those 3 different categories, can you comment on the probability that you see of each? And when it would affect your markets?\nHoward Nye: Yes. I guess what I would say is this. I'm increasingly wondering if the phase on aggregate just ends up being the new highway bill. And that's one reason that we're wondering if they don't go ahead and accelerate. And rather than having CRs this year on the FAST Act, we might see a new highway bill. And by the way, we would be perfectly fine with that. I think that's a good, steady undertaking. I think the one that I would watch here near term will be how that $50 billion is received because I do think there's going to be increasing pressure from state DOTs on their members of Congress and Senate members to shore up some revenue shortfalls and state DOTs are going to have. Timna, if we go back over the last decade, what you're clearly seeing, and you've got great work on it is, it's been the state DOTs that have really filled the hole over the last decade. The federal government has not -- and I think there's going to be a real need for the federal government to help offset that in the downturn. So near term, I will watch more closely on AASHTO or the AASHTO-like request, and I'll be more focused on the emphasis of having a ready to go highway bill behind the FAST Act.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up was on the AASHTO request. They point to that potential 30% decline in state revenues for DOTs over the next 18 months. But is that a Martin number? Or is that their number? And would you think that, that would translate to your specific states?\nHoward Nye: That's their number. And I think it varies considerably by state. And actually, Timna, ARPA has a really good chart that can take you on a state-by-state journey, if you're so inclined on what federal funds, what state funds look like and then how state funds roll into it. So different states, for example, will deal differently with gas tax or vehicle transfer fees or others. And then equally, depending on what the source of the funds are, dictates how much of a trust fund you may have around some of those dollars.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Rohit Seth from SunTrust.\nRohit Seth: Building on the last couple of questions. If we didn't get a full $50 billion bill out, something somewhat less than that, and all the money goes into the DOT fund. And you get a continuing resolution with the FAST Act. And given what you have in your backlog, because it gets a little bit more complicated than just looking at those 2 metrics. But is there a potential for growth in the infrastructure end market in 2021 in those circumstances?\nHoward Nye: I think there could be in some stage, Rohit. I mean I don't think you can dismiss that. And again, part of what I was outlining, and I think it was in part going back to Jerry's question, he was talking about the difference in the markets that we operate in today versus where we were a decade ago. If you look at this, the fiscal condition of states today, most of the states, aside from some of these very discrete COVID issues, are in very good conditions, particularly with rainy day funds. We talked about a big rainy day fund in Texas. There's a big rainy day fund in North Carolina as well. So I think what's happening with a lot of states, in fairness, they're waiting to see what comes out of Washington. And then they're going to make their own state-by-state decisions on what they need to do. What I would tell you is if you go to each one of these large states in which we have a significant presence, they all tend to view infrastructure as a critical priority. And they view it as a critical priority because their population trends are such that if they don't stay ahead of that, they're going to be in a really difficult place. And by the way, that's a high-class problem, not a bad problem. So short answer is, yes. I think you could see degrees of growth. I don't think you would necessarily see it everywhere under that scenario. But I think you could see it. Yes, Rohit.\nRohit Seth: Okay. And then it's five years since the FAST Act. And when we look back at kind of how that played out, the states have raised their money funding as well. If we did get a new highway bill, what do you think changed in terms of how quickly that money can be put to work, what projects are out there in the marketplace? And just your thoughts on what the highway bill will look like?\nHoward Nye: Yes. Here's what's different. If you think about what happened last time, Rohit, they had -- at state DOTs, that had significant layoffs. So they went -- they came into the recovery without a lot of engineering and design professionals. So the fact is they weren't in a position to put jobs out to bid and award and give notices to proceed. I think that's fundamentally different today. I think when we go back and think about that statement I gave you just a few minutes ago relative to Colorado, when I said we won $100 million more in work year-to-date in April '20 than we did in the prior year. I think that's actually pretty good evidence of where DOT sit today. You can also go and look and see how different DOTs have dealt with it over the last decade.  Texas DOT, frankly, has just hired a lot of people. North Carolina DOT has outsourced a lot of that design work to very specific engineering firms across the state. And they put themselves in a position that their delivery rate could actually be very attractive. And oddly enough, that's one of the things state is sorting through right now because they were able to get projects out much more quickly frankly than they thought they would. So again, if you look structurally at how DOTs are set today versus where they were a decade ago, it's very different. And I think from contractor or material supplier perspective, it's an advantage to the industry.\nRohit Seth: Okay. And then last question on M&A. I know last quarter, it sounded like the pipeline was heating up a bit, but the world has further changed. I mean maybe comment on what the deal flow looks like out there? Are you -- do you still have an appetite to do maybe a sizable deal? Or are you going to be a little bit more conservative in near term?\nHoward Nye: I guess a couple of things, Rohit. Number one, I think if you go back and look at the deals that we've done, I think you can look at the history on them, and you'll be pleased with what we've done. Because -- and I think that's in large part because we've been thoughtful about what, and we've been thoughtful about when, and we've been thoughtful about size. So I'm going to give you the answer you would expect, and I'm going to say it all entirely depends. I mean there could be some deals that would come along that would be so impactful to us. That if you were looking over our shoulder at a model, you would say, good heavens, go and do that. And there are going to be others that we will likely be more cautious with. And frankly, you would urge that as well. Part of what I spoke of in the comments is we have an experienced management team, and this is not our first rodeo. And it's not going to be our first rodeo of looking at deals in a market that might be different. So we will look at them. We want to grow our business. We want to grow it responsibly. We also understand the value of a fortress balance sheet. And that's what we have today. And what we want to make sure we can do, Rohit, said the best of all worlds. And I think we've got a path to do it.\nRohit Seth: But you're going to maintain that investment grade at all costs, is that right?\nHoward Nye: We've certainly said it's important to us. I'm not sure we've ever said at all costs, but it certainly is important to us.\nRohit Seth: All right. All right. That's all I want to know.\nHoward Nye: All right, Rohit. All right. Thank you all for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Martin Marietta has the right strategies, the right priorities and the right team to responsibly navigate through these challenging times and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move this company forward. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2020 results in a few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. \nHoward Nye: Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay healthy. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Howard Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. First and foremost, we hope that you and your families are and remain safe and healthy as we confront the challenges and uncertainties presented by COVID-19.  I also want to extend my sincere gratitude to our Martin Marietta team. I'm tremendously proud of how everyone is working together to manage through this unprecedented time and how the character of our employees has shown through. Day after day, Martin Marietta employees are safely and resolutely meeting the critical needs of our customers. They're also supporting their local communities in both large and small ways donating vital supplies and equipment to health care workers and first responders, helping neighbors by picking up groceries and ensuring our colleagues are well cared for and safe. Our team has shown great courage, determination and resilience as we successfully meet our stakeholders' needs while never losing sight of our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, community and stewardship.  These values define us and our character. We look at these foundational principles to guide our daily and long-term actions and decisions, particularly during difficult times. Martin Marietta remains open as an essential business. That designation means we're continuing to provide heavy building materials and services to our customers even in those areas with shelter-in-place orders. Communities across the nation must maintain their vital infrastructure and we're working hard to support that objective in a safe, efficient and responsible way.  Through the end of April, our workforce, operations and supply chains have seen little disruption. We believe this is largely due to our company's decisive steps early to respond quickly to this pandemic, our domestic focused approach to sourcing supplies and materials and our expanded safety procedures, all of which are designed to protect Martin Marietta employees and the organizational health of the company.  During this pivotal time, our focus is threefold: communication, resource management and business continuity. We've implemented new robust protocols and practices, including remote working, social distancing and enhanced equipment and facility cleaning, consistent with guidelines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the medical professionals who partner with the industrial hygienist familiar with our operations. These protocols were updated on an ongoing basis as public experts provide additional guidance. We also established a COVID-19 Planning and Communications task force, canceled all nonessential business travel and in-person meetings and established contingency plans with respect to staffing, and we've been actively engaged enterprise-wide to enhance the substance and frequency of our communications to ensure the flow of the most accurate and timely information about our operations, thus enabling our employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to stay fully informed.  Our operations teams have shown considerable agility, flexibility and perseverance while keeping our business running smoothly. Among other things, they've taken timely and responsible steps to clean and disinfect their facilities, while carefully screening necessary third-party visitors to minimize any COVID-19 exposure. Thanks to their dedication and effectiveness, our company has adapted extraordinarily well.  Additionally, for our colleagues that typically work in doors in close proximity to one another, we're utilizing a combination of social distancing as well as work-from-home protocols. Our employees are dutifully meeting their job responsibilities and remaining fully accessible.  Importantly, whether working at an operating site, an office or remotely, our employees are empowered and encouraged to look out for one another. With our team's safe and employee engagement high, we can be attentive to our other stakeholders, our customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders and communities as we have an essential business to run.  As disclosed in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered strong first quarter financial and operational performance. Jim will discuss these results with you shortly. Let me first say that we're proud of these results, which underscore our commitment to operational excellence and to our disciplined strategies. While we had a promising start of what we believe would have been a record-setting 2020, we recognize this year will now be filled with an unprecedented level of uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and societal outcomes continue to unfold. Accordingly, while we remain confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance issued back in February.  We've not yet seen contractors and customers delaying or canceling building projects in a material way. While we typically do not comment on intra-quarter trends, these are atypical times. We're making an exception and as highlighted on our supplemental information Slides 13 and 14, we are sharing preliminary April shipment and pricing trends to provide greater transparency as to what we're now seeing in a COVID-19-impacted month.  Specifically, for the month of April, aggregate shipments remained elevated in most areas but did not match the near-record April 2019 volumes. We saw notable growth in North Texas, Colorado and Indiana. Cement shipments continue to be strong and are currently trending close to prior year levels. The one notable exception is oil well cement shipments as demand continues to decline due to volatile and historically low oil prices. Ready mixed concrete shipments are also trending near April 2019 levels, even as some homebuilders temporarily pause construction activity.  April revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business are $10 million lower than the comparable prior year period. Demand for our lime and periclase products has slowed dramatically as steel-producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers beginning in mid-March.  In terms of April pricing trends, aggregates pricing improved mid-single digits over April 2019 as announced increases were broadly implemented earlier in the year. Cement pricing is up, even with several competitors announcing plans to delay price increases until June 1. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were highly confident in realizing the full announced increase of $8 per ton implemented April 1, given overwhelming market support in a tight Texas cement environment.  Ready mixed concrete pricing is slightly higher than April 2019 levels. We'll have a clearer picture of ready mixed concrete pricing trends for the remainder of the year as the phased reopening of the Texas and Colorado economies unfold. Though ours is a basic and durable industry, it does not mean that we're immune to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. Our economy is interconnected and dislocations in consumer behavior or other industries may impact Martin Marietta. As such, looking beyond April, we anticipate product demand will soften in the coming months, with the private sector feeling the effects sooner than the public sector. The timing, duration and extent of weaker demand levels are presently unknown. Infrastructure, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, is expected to be the most resilient of the company's 3 primary end uses in the near term. The vast majority of state departments of transportation are operational and continue to advertise and award projects. Nonetheless, we expect many state DOT budgets will face temporary headwinds from lower fuel taxes, tolls, user fees and other related revenue collections as much of the nation has been sheltered in place.  The impact of lower funding levels is expected to become more meaningful in the second half of 2020, absent congressional action and will vary considerably among the states. Florida DOT, for example, has accelerated over $2 billion of critical transportation projects to leverage construction efficiencies resulting from lower vehicle traffic, including closing additional travel lanes and performing more daytime hours work. To help mitigate state DOT funding risks, industry representatives are actively engaging with Congress to address surface transportation in the Phase 4 emergency relief and economic recovery COVID-19 legislation. The first recommendation is the federal backstop of nearly $50 billion in immediate flexible funding to offset the estimated 30% loss in state transportation revenues over the next 18 months. The second recommendation is the passage of a comprehensive major surface transportation reauthorization package. We believe our industry is better equipped than in recent history to execute on an infrastructure build given the backlog of fully designed projects.  Nonresidential construction activity on existing projects has broadly continued in most regions. However, many commercial projects and the engineering or planning stages are being delayed or canceled, particularly for office, retail and hospitality. Some industrial activity, on the other hand, is not expected to experience significant near-term disruption from COVID-19, warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to perform relatively well in the current environment, as businesses increase e-commerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services.  Similarly, large energy sector projects along the Gulf Coast of Texas that are already underway are expected to continue.  The residential market is expected to experience the most rapid and perhaps steepest decline from the impacts of COVID-19 as unemployment and general economic instability of home buyers and home developers to delay plans. However, in contrast to the Great Recession, we do not anticipate a prolonged period of reduced residential activity. Today's housing inventories remain near all-time lows despite notable population gains in Martin Marietta states and to benefit from historically low interest rates.  As we prepare for the secondary effects of the economic fallout from the coronavirus, we rely on our values-driven culture. As I emphasized earlier, the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders remains our top priority. With established protections in place to accomplish this, we're focused on our business priorities of generating cash flow, preserving liquidity and adjusting costs to align with product demand. Our team has developed extensive plans for a variety of economic scenarios, and we're ready to implement them with immediacy and integrity as warranted.  In addition to strengthening our balance sheet through a timely $500 million bond offering in early March, we've cut nonessential costs, reduced capital spending for discretionary projects and implemented hiring restrictions. We're tightening our belts and aligning our capacity with demand consistent with our commitment to being prudent stewards of shareholders' capital. We will reevaluate these actions as visibility improves.  Having the right strategy, making the right decisions at the right time, and being able to safely execute them does matter a lot. And Martin Marietta will do just that. We're well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to successfully manage through today's unprecedented environment and emerge more resilient and capable.  How so? First, Martin Marietta has a much stronger geographic and competitive position today compared with any previous downturn in our more than 25 years as a public company. This is noteworthy, considering we navigated through the Great Recession and remain profitable throughout, never suspended or cut a dividend and emerged with a healthy balance sheet. Today, we continue to generate record profitability on aggregate shipment levels much lower than our peak volumes in 2005, and with a geographic footprint that we've not only considerably expanded but also improved. Moreover, we continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategic plans, carefully positioning our business through aggregates-led expansion in high-growth markets with attractive fundamentals and leveraging strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. These strategic plans not only provide Martin Marietta with new growth platforms, but also opportunities to expand our footprint to complement existing operations and build critical mass. We now have leading positions in 90% of our markets, up from 65% a decade ago, which supports favorable pricing trends, economies of scale and cost flexibility.  Second, we have experienced teams with decades of collective industry knowledge and expertise. Together, their leadership and contributions have produced strong and sustained financial returns for Martin Marietta and our shareholders as recently demonstrated by our 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative shareholder return performance. This is largely the same leadership team that successfully formulated our operational response and prudently addressed our business needs during the Great Recession, the most challenging economic environment our industry ever experienced.  In uncertain evolving times, proven cycle tested leadership and experience is critical. In brief, Martin Marietta has the right strategies, priorities, experience and teams to responsibly manage us through these challenging times.  I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a more detailed financial review. Jim? Thanks, Jim. In summary, we are pleased with our solid first quarter performance and enhanced liquidity. In regards to our 2020 full year guidance, we will reinstate earnings guidance once we have sufficient visibility to do so. That said, we remain confident that the attractive underlying market fundamentals and long-term secular growth trends in our key geographies, both of which underpin the company's record 2019 performance and strong first quarter 2020 results, remain intact and will be evident once again as the U.S. economy stabilizes and recovers.  Martin Marietta is well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to responsibly navigate today's extraordinary environment and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move forward. We have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed on our strategic plans positioning our business as an aggregates leader in attractive high-growth geographies, aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities and prudently allocating capital while maintaining financial flexibility. In doing so, we have built a business that is durable, resilient and stronger than ever. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. Great. Thanks for your question. Look, I think a couple of things are worth noting. To your point, AASHTO is the one that has come out and asked for the $50 billion infusion from the federal government to states. And again, you're exactly right. That's taking into account that they are seeing something that could be a 30% delta in gas tax collections. So we'll see where that goes from the federal perspective. That's probably going to take a few months to see. I think on a state-by-state basis, what you're likely to see, Trey, our states are going to have to come back and their legislatures are going to have to address funding for different DOTs.  And I think that's going to vary pretty considerably. If we look at Texas, which is our largest state by revenue, their DOTs are in a pretty healthy place. And they've got a very healthy rainy day fund. They're indicating, for example, that they don't see a need go to that during this first year. So the fact is, depending on how revenues come in, places like TxDOT may not need to go there at all. States like Colorado, which is our second largest by revenue, have the ability should their treasurer choose to issue certificates of participation and we think those types of levers, you can keep Colorado DOT in a very good place. North Carolina DOT is in a similar spot. We've discussed the fact historically that they've had some storm issues that they needed to manage through and they had some issues relative to some litigation, commonly referred to as the Map Act. COVID-19 has made that a bit more complicated for North Carolina DOT. The legislature is in session. They are looking at several things that they can do in that state. One thing that's worth noting, and of course, it's here in our backyard, we actually, over the last couple of years, have been very successful in bidding on work here in North Carolina. So for example, one of your concerns is what would tonnage look like going forward, we booked over 10 million tons of aggregates on 6 large NCDOT projects in North Carolina.  And we've only shipped about 600,000 of that 10 million. So to your point, could different states feel different degrees of pressure, they probably will. Do we think Southeastern and Southwestern states that tend to be our leading states will come through that better than most? We think so. Do we think existing projects that are underway will continue going? I think the answer to that is, we believe strongly that, that will be the case. And I think you could see some instances in the second half of people looking at bidding activity a little bit more carefully, particularly relative to maintenance in public. But again, Trey, we see this as being pretty steady and pretty resilient, and there will be some one-offs here or there and legislatures will need to endeavor to deal with it. And we think we will likely get some help from the federal government. The last thing that I'll add to it is I do think this gives increased impetus as we said in the prepared remarks, toward getting a successor to the FAST Act.  My view has long been that the Senate plan is likely to be the one that will be pushed forward. As you recall, that's a $287 billion, 5-year plan that basically is looking at a pretty significant increase of our FAST Act funding levels. So we feel like that would be a very worthwhile and useful endeavor for our friends in Washington. Look, I think the markets are better suited today than they were last time and they did great last time. And I don't see anything that gives me any concerns around the aggregates pricing thesis. I think that works. If you look at the quarter, you can look at our quarter and say the numbers were a little lower than we thought. The fact is we saw really big increases in volume in our Central division and our West division. And our Central division has an ASP as just our West division that are lower than corporate-wide ASPs. So I would not let Q1 pricing give you any degree of concern around the overall thesis. As you could tell from our supplemental materials, once you got into April, you saw pricing with a 4 handle in front of it. The other thing that I would say, Trey, is I think you will see greater resilience in cement, particularly in our business in Texas as well this year. We think we're going to continue despite these recent trends with COVID-19 to see good solid price increases in Texas cement. So again, if we look at aggregates, no, I don't think anything has changed there. If anything, it's better. And I think cement is better as well. Yes. No, the 10 million tons from everything that we have seen and gleaned, yes, is funded and we anticipate those projects will be going. They tend to be, though they're not wholly, in Eastern North Carolina, and they're going to be going through '20 and '21. So we see those projects as being certainly through the rest of this year and into next year, Kathryn. Sure. Absolutely, Kathryn. I'm going to give you a couple of broad side views on that and ask Jim to talk you through a more detailed review. As you could tell, what's always interesting to me is when we have an inventory variation and it goes down. People who are uninformed will look at that and be troubled by it. Actually, that's something that we celebrate inside because it actually means our costs are going down, which is exactly what you want and exactly what our shareholders want. So what we saw in part was a change in inventory because our costs were getting better. Part of what we can talk through as well is a certain degree of geographic mix shift that we saw change. For example, our Central division saw volumes up over 20% in the quarter. Our West division saw volumes up over 15% in the quarter. And to give you a sense of it, central ASPs are in the mid-12s as our western ASPs and you look at overall ASPs at 14.80. So when you go through that, you start to get a sense of what could be modestly different as you go through a bridge in a quarter that remember, is our lowest volume quarter. So things can feel oversized in that. What I'll tell you is the more you look at this quarter, the more you're going to like this quarter, and let me turn it over to Jim. He can walk you through while I feel that way. Kathryn, that was a lot of math and a lot of color, but I hope that helped. But Garik, what you should expect is just what Jim said. And in prepared comments, we said we are going to adjust costs as we go through a volume profile as well. I think part of what's important to remember is what we outlined, this is a business that was always profitable and never cut a dividend. And I think we can surprise in any marketplace today. I'm going to give you a historic, and I'm going to give you a closer to real time. So historic, in a normal time, you would have expected about 30% of our business to have been nonres. You would have expected about half of that 30% or 15% to be heavy. You would have expected about 15% of it to have been lighter, meaning more office, retail, et cetera. Actually, what we've seen is it's trended modestly more toward heavy. And you can imagine why because more people are shopping behind a keyboard as opposed to in a shopping center. So while housing has been relatively good, retail, that typically would have fallen housing, has not been as robust and it shifted more toward warehousing and the Amazonation of United States.  And that's actually something that we've benefited from. So what I would say, Garik, is if you look historically at a phase, say, that ended at the first -- at the end of the first quarter, you would have expected a bigger piece of that than really we've seen being office and retail. It tends to be modestly more heavy today. If we go into a deeper government-mandated recession, and that's how I like to think about this one, you could certainly see the heavy side of it being a larger percentage. But at least historically, that's where it's been, that's where it is as we finish the first quarter and we finished April. And as we think about what it could look like going forward, we tried to outline in the prepared remarks that it could be that light side of nonres that could feel some components of that earlier rather than later. So it's going to be, call it, probably low double digits. No, no, no... Okay. I think cement is going to hang in there pretty well. I mean what I would say back to your first part on pricing. I mean obviously we came into the year feeling very good about pricing, feeling very good about the 8 up until COVID. I still think we're going to get price increases in Texas. And that ties back into the commentary that we have overall on aggregate pricing thesis being very tight, cement actually getting better. In fairness, Phil, I think pricing is going to be better in the north than it's going to be in the south, but I think you're going to get it in both places. And again, I think we're -- you're going to see very good cost control in cement this year.  For example, if we're looking at our kiln maintenance expenses year-over-year, we're anticipating that they're going to be about $7.6 million less in '20 than they were in '19. Part of what you saw in Q1 is there are about $2.8 million less in Q1 of '20 than they were in '19. So it's hard to know exactly how to address the margin issue there. You obviously saw very attractive margins for the first quarter. Because that business does have a higher fixed cost. But again, we've put over the last decade, about $1 billion worth of CapEx into that business. I think we've got cement plants in Texas that are close to state of the art. We're utilizing very different energy resources at that facility today that are reducing our costs. So we think our cost profile will be good. We think our pricing profile is getting better. And actually part of what we're liking too is I think if you're seeing good aggregate pricing, good cement pricing, you're likely to see a much more steady market relative to ready mix as well. So Phil, I've given you a lot of color around the way that, that business is operating now and what the change is year-over-year. And why we feel confident with that business as it sits. I hope that's helpful and responsive. Yes. Look, what I'd tell you is last year in April was near-record April. So what I'll tell you is April, looking at these trends that you saw felt very good. And even if you look at those charts on, I guess, supplemental Slide 13, it shows a little bit of a dip in early April. And by the way, we call that Easter. So that's exactly what that was. So again, if you look last year at a near-record April, if you look at very solid volumes this year in April, if you look at a better pricing environment. And of course, part of what we spoke about earlier in the call, with the odd conversation on the inventories, is the cost profile is getting better. Look, it's hard not to triangulate around those three things and feel like you've got a very durable business. Yes, I think you could. I mean let's look at it in two different ways, Stanley. Let's look at what the world looked like before the government-mandated recession. So housing was healthy through March. Permits were up 7.4% versus prior year. If we look states that matter to us, Texas was up 10.5%. Florida was up almost 11%, North Carolina was up almost 9%. So to your point, very healthy housing marketplace then comes down a series of shelter-in-place orders. And obviously, you see confidence turn pretty quickly from the end of the year when it was high. To what it felt like toward the end of March. Here's what I would say. If we look at regions that have declined and they all have, the Northeast has declined the most. The Midwest has declined next the most.  And then the one that has declined the least, to your point, has been the South. And if you think about where we have built our business, it's not exclusively, but it's largely a Southeast and Southwestern U.S. business. So what we would say is this, we think the south, clearly outperformed on the upside. We think the south is going to outperform on the downside. But equally, we think, if things get turned back on, that it will perform quite well. Here's part of what's different in this government-mandated recession versus prior one, Stanley, housing is not overbuilt. So if we look at population trends, and we again, noted that in the prepared remarks, population trends in North Carolina, populations trends in Georgia, Florida, Texas, Colorado, all states in which we have 1 or 2 positions, are very attractive population dynamics.  The other piece of it, Stanley, and this is one that I would ask you and your colleagues who spend time thinking about this to ponder. I think you're likely to see more people pivoting away from urban living and looking more to live in suburbs for a while. I think having some space is going to be something that people will gravitate towards. The other thing, and it pivots modestly away from your housing question, but I think it's relevant. I think as we think about what a Transportation Act is likely to look like in this next generation, I think it's going to be heavier on surface transportation and perhaps lighter on transit because suddenly, the notion of getting in trains or otherwise is going to be something I think people would be cautious of. So again, Stan, I'll try to answer your question very specifically, where were we pre-COVID? Where are we now? What did the percentages look like? Where do we think the comeback will be the quickest and some of the, I guess, color around the why. Yes, certainly can. What I would say is this, look, we're always very sensitive to SG&A. And I think if you look at us compared to most of our peers and you look at our SG&A as a percent of revenue, you're going to be pretty impressed with where that is. What I would tell you is we will absolutely positively adjust that as we feel like we need to. So -- and I think our track record reveals, that's something that we will do. But importantly, Stanley, we'll do it in the right way. With respect to diesel fuel last year, we used right at -- I believe, it was right at 15 million gallons of diesel fuel last year. And for those of you who are wondering, we used a whopping 11.7 million gallons in the first quarter of 2020. Good to hear your voice. Yes. One of the things that I'm sensitive to, Jerry, to your point, is we've got a 1 or 2 position in 90% of our markets today. In the Great recession, we had a 1 or 2 position, 65% of our markets. Okay. So let's take -- let's talk a bit about what critical mass can mean. And I think critical mass and the dimension of your question, is our friend. I think equally, you raised a really good point, and that is we've been very thoughtful about geographic areas that we wanted to exit and geographic areas that we wanted to enter. And what we try to do is enter areas with high relative population growth and multiple economic drivers. So if we go back and take a look at the way our SOAR plan has come together and dictated that we have 1 or 2 positions, it truly has dictated that we have landed where we have. I think the markets where we have these positions, they are far better than they were before.  I equally think from a local land use perspective, the barriers to entry are as high, candidly, probably higher today than they were before. If you think about even during the last several years and what I think most would say has been a relatively good economy in some of these sectors of the United States, you've not seen a great deal of greenfielding. And I think in a down economy, you see even less of that. The other thing that's important to remember, Jerry, is in construction, we're seldom going to be the reason that a contractor is either successful in getting a job or not successful in getting a job. And what I mean by that is this. Stone is about 10% of the cost of building road. It's about 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those 2 percentages on a nonresidential project. In other words, we are the product that's utterly essential for that project to go forward because there is no substitute, generally speaking, for what we do. At the same time, we're not going to make or break what's going on relative to the project. I think that's one reason that you saw aggregates do so well in the last downturn. My sense is, for all of those reasons you will see it do, in my view, better as we go through this period of time. I think we will continue to be very consistent all the way through this, at least from a Martin Marietta perspective. Part of what we talked about historically, is -- you're right, it would either go up or the volume upwards slow with the price up would slow with volume. The fact is, Jerry, if you look over the last several years, it's never really worked that way. Actually, pricing, in some respects, has done better overall than volume has done, particularly in places where there's been some reasonable consolidations. So to your point, if we look at what ASPs have done in Colorado, on a percentage basis, they've gone up nicely ahead of aggregate volumes overall. So I think it's going to vary a lot by geographic region. But at the same time, this has proven itself not to behave in a down market as a commodity. So from our perspective, again, recognizing that we're a very small percentage of the overall costs, but we have a product in the ground that's more valuable tomorrow than it is today, we're going to approach pricing with that mindset. Right. No, not at all. If I may, Paul, I'll turn it over to Jim, and he'll take you through those. One of the nice things about -- I'll give you this one bit of color. One of the nice things about being a building material supplier is you either have lean rights on private jobs or you have bond rights on public jobs. So actually, ours is one of those sectors that tends to have more stable and collectible receivables than most. So with that as a preliminary background, let me turn the balance of the question over to Jim. It certainly could. What I'll tell you is most closely held businesses are probably in a pretty good place going into this downturn. My experience is it's more succession issues that tend to drive those decisions than it is near-term economic issues, but I'm not going to be naive and assume that there are not some people out there who may feel otherwise in that respect. One of the things that you'll see, if you look at our balance sheet is we're right at 2.3x debt to EBITDA. That's very much within the range that we like to stay. Paul, if you go back and take a look at where we were going into the Great Recession and what we look like coming out of the Great Recession, we did utilize that downturn to grow our business very, very responsibly. We continue to say that our best first dollar is in the right acquisition and emphasis on the word right. So we will continue to watch for that. We like to believe that we're going to be a preferred acquirer if businesses should come up. And we will watch that, and we will be very thoughtful about the way that we approach it. No. Sure. Let me deal with the latter one first. If we go, the only place that we have asphalt is in Colorado, just as a reminder. And one of the great things about being in Colorado is you're not on either one of the coasts. So what it tells you is asphalt and liquid stays relatively steady as you go through it. So if we look at liquid costs as we went through Q1, they were really about $450 a ton. They've recently come closer to about $420 a ton. So we don't think we're going to see big variations in that Colorado market relative to liquid. One of the things that's worth knowing is if we look at our backlog in asphalt and paving, we've got about $100 million more in work year-to-date this year in April than we did in the prior year. So we've got a very attractive paving business in that marketplace, and we've got a cost structure that we think is going to be quite helpful to us as we go there. The other thing that we saw in Q1 is we saw some municipal work accelerated. And it's a practical matter for us, what happens is we bid on municipal work. Oftentimes, we negotiate private work.  So at times, you'll see a modestly lower selling price on the muni work simply because it's bid. So I just wanted to make sure that we talked through that. Back to your other question. Several things relative to TxDOT. If we look back over the last several years, going back to as late as 2017 and look at numbers that were awarded at TxDOT. In 2017, it was $5.1 billion. In 2018, it was $7.6 billion. In 2019, $8.9 billion. We've got a couple of different estimates right now, but the latest estimate I've seen for Texas is around $7.9 billion. So again, if you look at $7.9 billion and you look at what that -- how that racks up relative to history, that's not a bad place to be. The thing to remember on Prop 1 and Prop 7, and I think that was the gravamen of much of your question. Prop 1 allocates portions of oil and gas revenues to the State Highway fund through 2034. Prop 7 is -- really comes into play of sales and tax collections reached $28 billion.  And after that, the next $2.5 billion are transferred to DOT. We're going to have to watch and see how some of the Prop 1 and Prop 7 monies go. I think we haven't seen any big surprises coming from that so far. And that, in part, that's driven by what I had mentioned before, Texas has a $10 billion rainy day fund. And the Texas controller so far has indicated that the state can manage whatever revenue loss they've seen in this first year without having to go and tap in that rainy day fund. But in any event, we know a very robust fund is there. So several things. I'll try to give you what I think is responsive data relative to asphalt, liquid and paving in Colorado, give you a good sense of what total TxDOT current letting should look like over a period of years where those dollars have come from and where we think that is and the backstop of rainy day fund. So thanks for the question. Here's the way I would respond to that. I guess several things. One, lower oil actually helps us on diesel pretty considerably. If we go back to the sheer volume of gallons that we burned through a year, 50 million gallons is not a small amount. So it helps us in that dimension. To your point, do we have some energy exposure relative to stone that we have sold to people traditionally in the shale fields? The answer is yes. If we go back and say, okay, what did that look like at absolute peak? At peak back in 2014, we sold 7.5 million tons to different shale producers who needed stone to build pads or internal roads. The absolute bottom of the cycle, we sold 1.4 million. And last year, we were 2.3 million.  And this year, we said we probably thought we'd be somewhere between 2.5 million and 3 million because we thought that was a pretty steady, steady run rate. So I would say that relative to those things. Now with respect to your other question, which is a good one, on the balance of some of nonres, if we think about those really large energy projects, not shale activity, but the shale -- but the large energy projects in South Texas. Here's what I would say. The first wave of those really has gone. There were total awards for about 7.9 million tons of aggregates and about 660,000 cubic yards of concrete. And of those 7.9 million, we won about 3.5 million tons of it. And that's consistent with what we've said. We said we weren't going to get all of that, but we would get our share of it.  And I think we certainly have. If we think about what the rest of this year is likely to look like, I think in 2020, we'll probably ship around 1 million tons during the course of the year to those different projects. And what that means is this, it means Port Arthur LNG, Golden Pass and some other large projects that are still down there on the books will likely be pushed out to the right just a little bit. And as a reminder, that's going to tally up to modestly over 14 million tons of aggregates coming forward in these projects over the course of time. So again, I've tried to address diesel cost and what that energy means to us in our business. I've tried to address what's going on in the shale fields, both at peak, trough last year, what we thought this year would be and when our overall view is on the large energy projects on the Gulf Coast. No. I think the fact is if they agree to it, you could get an increase in. And actually, David, what's been interesting, that's exactly where we thought we were coming into the year. We anticipated that the most likely result in 2020 was to be in continuing resolution land until post-election. I do think it's going to be interesting to see if there's going to be a push to have a successor to the FAST Act before then. Because obviously, it does expire in September. I think the one thing that I would say is this, I think everyone learned from the experience a decade ago that short-term CRs are not good for anybody. They're not good for the government. They're not good for the states. They're not good for the contractors. And they're not good for the material suppliers. So I would say that I'm not sure that we're totally in a place that it's only going to be CRs. I think you might see something more at the Senate level as opposed to the House level, but they clearly -- if they wanted to take it up, they could. Well, I think we're -- our comments more geared toward private activity and what may or may not happen then. And I think much of it, David, is going to be dictated by how quickly we come out of some of these stay-at-home orders and how the economy, frankly, reacts to several things. I think that's going to be your driver. I think the light portion of nonres has historically proven itself to be the place that people can either turn on or turn off with greater precision than others. I think homebuilding, the same thing can be said there. If you look at what homebuilders have done, even during the last several weeks, many of them hit pause for a period of time. I think we certainly feel like they're going to come back and resume. But again, I think what we're trying to outline, David, is none of us have ever done this before. This is going to be a little bit different. The things that I think are going to be constant is, I think we're going to do really well on pricing. I think we're going to do really well on costs. I think we're going to get our share of business. I think the question is going to be exactly what will business on the private side look like. And I think if anybody can tell us that, that's somebody we'd all like to have on their payroll. Yes. I guess what I would say is this. I'm increasingly wondering if the phase on aggregate just ends up being the new highway bill. And that's one reason that we're wondering if they don't go ahead and accelerate. And rather than having CRs this year on the FAST Act, we might see a new highway bill. And by the way, we would be perfectly fine with that. I think that's a good, steady undertaking. I think the one that I would watch here near term will be how that $50 billion is received because I do think there's going to be increasing pressure from state DOTs on their members of Congress and Senate members to shore up some revenue shortfalls and state DOTs are going to have. Timna, if we go back over the last decade, what you're clearly seeing, and you've got great work on it is, it's been the state DOTs that have really filled the hole over the last decade. The federal government has not -- and I think there's going to be a real need for the federal government to help offset that in the downturn. So near term, I will watch more closely on AASHTO or the AASHTO-like request, and I'll be more focused on the emphasis of having a ready to go highway bill behind the FAST Act. That's their number. And I think it varies considerably by state. And actually, Timna, ARPA has a really good chart that can take you on a state-by-state journey, if you're so inclined on what federal funds, what state funds look like and then how state funds roll into it. So different states, for example, will deal differently with gas tax or vehicle transfer fees or others. And then equally, depending on what the source of the funds are, dictates how much of a trust fund you may have around some of those dollars. I think there could be in some stage, Rohit. I mean I don't think you can dismiss that. And again, part of what I was outlining, and I think it was in part going back to Jerry's question, he was talking about the difference in the markets that we operate in today versus where we were a decade ago. If you look at this, the fiscal condition of states today, most of the states, aside from some of these very discrete COVID issues, are in very good conditions, particularly with rainy day funds. We talked about a big rainy day fund in Texas. There's a big rainy day fund in North Carolina as well. So I think what's happening with a lot of states, in fairness, they're waiting to see what comes out of Washington. And then they're going to make their own state-by-state decisions on what they need to do. What I would tell you is if you go to each one of these large states in which we have a significant presence, they all tend to view infrastructure as a critical priority. And they view it as a critical priority because their population trends are such that if they don't stay ahead of that, they're going to be in a really difficult place. And by the way, that's a high-class problem, not a bad problem. So short answer is, yes. I think you could see degrees of growth. I don't think you would necessarily see it everywhere under that scenario. But I think you could see it. Yes, Rohit. Yes. Here's what's different. If you think about what happened last time, Rohit, they had -- at state DOTs, that had significant layoffs. So they went -- they came into the recovery without a lot of engineering and design professionals. So the fact is they weren't in a position to put jobs out to bid and award and give notices to proceed. I think that's fundamentally different today. I think when we go back and think about that statement I gave you just a few minutes ago relative to Colorado, when I said we won $100 million more in work year-to-date in April '20 than we did in the prior year. I think that's actually pretty good evidence of where DOT sit today. You can also go and look and see how different DOTs have dealt with it over the last decade.  Texas DOT, frankly, has just hired a lot of people. North Carolina DOT has outsourced a lot of that design work to very specific engineering firms across the state. And they put themselves in a position that their delivery rate could actually be very attractive. And oddly enough, that's one of the things state is sorting through right now because they were able to get projects out much more quickly frankly than they thought they would. So again, if you look structurally at how DOTs are set today versus where they were a decade ago, it's very different. And I think from contractor or material supplier perspective, it's an advantage to the industry. I guess a couple of things, Rohit. Number one, I think if you go back and look at the deals that we've done, I think you can look at the history on them, and you'll be pleased with what we've done. Because -- and I think that's in large part because we've been thoughtful about what, and we've been thoughtful about when, and we've been thoughtful about size. So I'm going to give you the answer you would expect, and I'm going to say it all entirely depends. I mean there could be some deals that would come along that would be so impactful to us. That if you were looking over our shoulder at a model, you would say, good heavens, go and do that. And there are going to be others that we will likely be more cautious with. And frankly, you would urge that as well. Part of what I spoke of in the comments is we have an experienced management team, and this is not our first rodeo. And it's not going to be our first rodeo of looking at deals in a market that might be different. So we will look at them. We want to grow our business. We want to grow it responsibly. We also understand the value of a fortress balance sheet. And that's what we have today. And what we want to make sure we can do, Rohit, said the best of all worlds. And I think we've got a path to do it. We've certainly said it's important to us. I'm not sure we've ever said at all costs, but it certainly is important to us. All right, Rohit. All right. Thank you all for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Martin Marietta has the right strategies, the right priorities and the right team to responsibly navigate through these challenging times and drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value as we move this company forward. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2020 results in a few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay healthy. Take care."

            "name": "James Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. I will briefly highlight our first quarter results as well as provide a summary of our financial and liquidity positions, both of which support our near- and long-term strategies. As detailed in today's release, our first quarter financial and operational performance exceeded our expectations, particularly considering the record-setting prior year quarter that benefited from carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018. On a consolidated basis, total revenues increased 2% to $958 million, a first quarter record. Gross profit was relatively flat. Selling, general and administrative expenses improved 10 basis points as a percent of total revenues. Diluted earnings per share was $0.41 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, decreased 6% to $149 million.  The Building Materials business achieved record first quarter revenues. Across our geographic footprint, product demand trends remain strong, even in the Texas and North Georgia markets that experienced record or near-record precipitation levels. Aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete pricing also improved, with all divisions contributing to the solid growth, a testament to the strength of our markets, and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy. Building Materials gross profit improved slightly. Key takeaways include the following: aggregates product gross profit decreased $5 million, largely due to our quarterly update of inventory standard costs. Our per ton production costs have been trending downward over the last 12 months as cost control measures and operating efficiencies have their desired effect. All else equal, this would result in higher operating margins going forward. But in this quarter, it also resulted in a $4 million expense as we reflected the lower cost in our updated inventory valuation.  In contrast, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an $11 million inventory valuation adjustment to reflect the higher production costs experienced during the weather-impacted year in 2018. While this cumulative $15 million year-over-year inventory standard variance reduced quarterly product gross margin by 260 basis points, lower unit production costs will provide future benefits.  Cement product gross margin expanded 1,170 basis points driven by improved cost absorption from higher production levels as well as increased shipments to the San Antonio, Austin and Houston markets. Pricing gains, combined with lower maintenance and energy expenses also contributed to the improved margin.  Gross profit for the ready mixed concrete business declined $9 million. Pricing improvements and double-digit shipment growth in Colorado were more than offset by lower Texas volumes from record rainfall, delaying projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as well as increased raw material costs.  For the Magnesia Specialties business, product revenues decreased 13%, consistent with expectations as chemicals customers continue to reduce inventory levels for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. Notably, product gross margin improved 500 basis points despite lower revenues, driven by ongoing cost control measures and lower energy costs. We still currently anticipate the destocking trend of our chemicals customers to be transitory in nature.  Our consolidated results included several items that affect comparability with the prior year quarter. To provide additional clarity, we included a slide in the Q1 2020 supplemental information posted on our website that provides a normalized view of pretax earnings with the items affecting comparability removed from both current and prior year quarters. In addition to the aggregates inventory standard adjustments discussed earlier, these items also included $6 million of other nonoperating expenses to finance third-party railroad maintenance in exchange for a federal income tax benefit of approximately $7 million, which drove the low-income tax rate for the first quarter 2020. Lastly, we incurred a noncash expense of $2 million to implement a new paid time-off policy for our employees. As you will see on Slide 5, first quarter 2020 earnings before income tax, absent items affecting comparability, improved $15 million.  Moving on now to our capital structure. Throughout our history, Martin Marietta has operated with a growth mindset, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet to preserve our financial flexibility. As a result, we have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future. Given today's environment, that is an enviable place to be. We will continue to balance our long-standing, disciplined capital allocation priorities to maintain that flexibility. Our priorities remain value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile.  Our approach is intended to ensure our cash flows are sufficient for a range of scenarios. In today's uncertain environment, that range of scenarios is broader and actions to enhance cash flows and preserve liquidity are even more important. Before the extent of the economic disruption became better understood, we repurchased 211,000 shares during the first quarter. Since then, we have temporarily paused share repurchases. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and as circumstances change, we will revisit this pause in our share repurchase program.  To further bolster cash flows, as Ward mentioned, we are reducing our capital spending for discretionary projects. We now estimate full year capital expenditures will be $325 million to $350 million, down from our original guidance of $425 million to $475 million. We demonstrated our ability to pull back on capital spending in safe and prudent ways that did not damage the business in the long run during the Great Recession. We are doing that again now as appropriate.  We've strengthened the company's balance sheet and cash position with our timely bond offering in early March, issuing $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a 2.5% coupon. Proceeds will be used to repay the $300 million of floating rate notes that mature later this month, with the bulk of the remaining cash preserved on the balance sheet.  Looking forward, as you can see in our supplemental information slides, after satisfying the May repayment, we will have no additional bond maturities for more than 4 years. We are confident in our liquidity position. Net cash, combined with the nearly $760 million available on our existing revolving facilities, provided total liquidity of approximately $880 million at the end of the quarter. Additionally, at 2.3x net debt to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA, we remain well within our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x at the end of the first quarter. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward for some closing comments. Yes. Thanks, Ward. So we -- Kathryn, we put in the supplemental slides that walk. Walking folks from the Q1 of last year to Q1 of this year simply to help illustrate the improved quality of earnings this year versus last year. So kind of to put numbers to the descriptions that Ward just gave, the inventory revaluation item, that was $15 million that by itself is equivalent to 60 incremental margin basis points. In addition, the geographic mix from a margin perspective was about $10 million. So that's about 40 incremental margin basis points. A couple other items.  We had increased production. So our cost absorption was very good. That was slightly offset but not wholly offset by higher freight costs. So those 2 combined, netted out to about 8 basis points you would add back. And then lastly, diesel is a tailwind for the quarter. And if you want to pull that out to kind of keep it normalized, that equates to about 60 million -- sorry, 16 basis points. From an incremental perspective, it was $4 million. So the puts and takes, if you add all that up, the ins, the outs gets us to right around 55% to 60% incremental margin. Yes. I think theoretically, it should be the same going down as it is going up. We will endeavor to do better than that. We've got cost-reduction plans ready to go. If things get materially worse, we don't see it getting surely worse necessarily, but we're ready for that. So I think for now, it's probably safest to assume a symmetrical approach going up and going down. Yes, thanks. It's something that we're mindful of and we're watchful of. As a macro matter, I will say, our receivables are backstopping our AR facility. So that is a natural offset. So we get the access to funds almost immediately. So the AR receivable is a great source of funds for us. And that's through our $400 million AR facility. And as far as it relates to bad debt expense or writing off those receivables, it has historically been a very, very, very small, I would call it, insignificant expense for us, averaging around $3 million per year at most. And so that's not something that I'm troubled by. We will, of course, monitor that and take action as needed. But it's a very, very small number, typically. So that's not an issue for us. No. Not really. There's really -- again, from -- in our perspective, we're relatively agnostic in terms of ASP and profitability. They're pretty consistent."

Martin Marietta\u2019s diligent execution of our strategic operating analysis and review plan otherwise known as SOAR has been and continues to be the foundation of our long-term success differentiating us from our competitors. This year was no exception as our impressive 2021 results continue to underscore the importance of disciplined strategic planning combined with functional excellence. Our team steadfast commitment to our strategic priorities enabled Martin Marietta to extend our proven track record of delivering industry leading safety, growth and financial performance for our shareholders. Among our accomplishments, in 2021, we achieved the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. This year marked our 10th consecutive year of increases in consolidated product and services revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We also made significant progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives, among them, successfully completing more than $3 billion in value enhancing acquisitions. These transactions expanded our product offerings and attractive new and existing markets, establishing a formidable coast-to-coast geographic footprint supported by robust underlying demand we will continue to build on these achievements with a focus on delivering sustainable, long-term operational and financial success in 2022 and beyond. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter and portfolio optimization efforts. Pricing momentum and growing product shipments aided in part by mild weather extending the 2021 construction season provided a strong finish to the year. We completed the acquisition of the Lehigh Hanson's West Region business on October 1, which provides Martin Marietta with new growth platforms in three of the nation's largest mega regions in California and Arizona and will serve as a valuable platform for continued expansion in the years ahead. And finally, in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 27% increase in products and services revenues and a 17.5% increase in adjusted EBITDA capping-off a 12-month period of continued growth, robust M&A activity and record setting financial performance. Consistent with our SOAR 2025 priorities, we continually look for ways to optimize our portfolio through asset swaps and divestitures. To that end, following the closing of the Lehigh Hanson West acquisition, we received expressions of interest in the California based cement and concrete operations. As we focus on the product mix of our business to enhance value for our shareholders, we're currently evaluating alternatives for these operations and have classified these assets as held-for-sale. We anticipate providing more clarity regarding our plans for these assets during the first half of 2022. As I noted earlier, for the full year 2021, we established new financial records marking the 10th consecutive year of growth in each of the following metrics, products and services revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 10% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion increased 10% year-over-year or 14% excluding non-recurring gains and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $12.28 grew 6% year-over-year or 13% excluding non-recurring gains. I'm especially pleased to note that Martin Marietta\u2019s strong earnings growth and thoughtful SOAR execution provided our investors with a total shareholder return of 56% in 2021 more than double the S&P 500. Operating our business safely sets the foundation for achieving longstanding financial success. I'm proud to report that we achieved a company wide world class last time and some great for the fifth consecutive year with a 7% reduction in the total reportable incidents Martin Marietta also reported a total entry incident rate of 0.8 rate of 0.84 exceeding world class rate levels for the first time in our history. Even more rewarding is that our strong 2021 safety performance includes the safety results of our newly acquired operations. I'm incredibly grateful to our employees both new and tenured who embrace Martin Marietta\u2019s guardian and angel culture each and every day. With that overview, let's now turn to the full year operating performance. The building materials business experienced solid product demand across our geographic footprint, driven by single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and continued strengthen warehouses and data centers. Organic aggregate shipments increased nearly 4% to 193 million tones in line with the high end of our original 2021 guidance for volume growth and above 2019 pre -COVID levels. Acquired operations contributed an additional 8 million tons. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 3% with realized price increases partially offset by higher sales of lower price base and excess fuel material shipments in the second half of 2021. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this growth. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive, underpinned by market support prior announced price increases and overall customer confidence we anticipate being well positioned commercially and otherwise to respond to strong demand and more than offset inflationary headwinds in 2022. Our Texas cement business grew modestly to 4 million tons, establishing a new record for shipments supported by large projects, recovering energy sector activity and incremental pull-through from our interim downstream customers. Cement pricing grew 7% following multiple pricing increases during the year as the largest cement producer in Texas. Our cement operations are well positioned to continue to benefit from tight supply and healthy demand supported by diversified customer backlogs and our announced April 2022 price increase of $12 per ton. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, organic ready-mix concrete shipments increased 16% reflecting the healthy Texas and Colorado demand environment, pricing grew modestly. Despite solid fourth quarter volume improvement our Colorado asphalt and paving business was unable to overcome shipment declines from weather challenges and liquid asphalt supply disruptions that hindered construction activity during the traditionally productive summer months. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to conclude our full year 2021 discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim.\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we are evaluating our strategic alternatives as it relates to the California cement plants, related distribution terminals and California ready-mix operations. These assets, along with several parcels of land have been classified as assets held-for-sale on the balance sheet. And the profits they generate are shown as earnings from discontinued operations on the income statement. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are not included in either 2021 reported earnings from continuing operations or our forward earnings guidance. For our continuing operations, both the building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our record revenues and profitability, notwithstanding energy headwinds of almost $75 million which is nearly one-third higher compared with 2020 on an organic basis. Our aggregates pipeline established records for revenues and gross profit. Product gross margin of 29.6% included higher diesel costs and a $25 billion negative impact from selling acquired inventory. There was marked-up the fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 30.4% a 20 basis point decline versus the prior year. Gross profit per ton shift improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. Improve cement profitability in the second half of the year was not enough to overcome production inefficiencies and incremental storm related costs from February deep freeze in Texas. As a result, cement product gross margin declined 600 basis points to 31.8% despite top line growth. Increased raw material, energy and maintenance costs also pressured margins. Ready-mix concrete product gross margin was 8.3% relatively flat compared with prior year as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Adjusted products and services gross margin for asphalt and paving business decreased 180 basis points to 16.4% from higher raw materials cost and operational disruptions from a summertime Colorado liquid asphalt shortage. Magnesia Specialties achieved record revenues and profitability. Product revenues of $275 million increased 24% driven largely by demand for magnesia-based chemicals products used for cobalt extraction. Cobalt prices, which has doubled since the fourth quarter of 2020 are expected to remain at high levels and should support demand for chemicals products throughout 2022. Product gross profit increased 23% to $110 million even though higher costs for energy and contract services resulted in a 40 basis point decline in product gross margin to 40.2%. Martin Marietta ended 2021 with a strongest cash generation in our history, operating cash flow of $1.14 billion increased 8% driven by improvement in net working capital efficiency. SOAR continues to provide the framework to responsibly and sustainably grow our business and deploy capital for long-term success. The company's long standing capital allocation priorities balance our value enhancing acquisitions with proven capital expenditures, and our goal of consistently returning capital to shareholders while preserving financial flexibility and an investment grade credit rating profile. In addition to the $3.1 billion to deploy for attractive platform and bolt-on acquisitions in 2021, we also invested $423 million of capital into our business. In November, we completed a capacity expansion project at our Bridgeport quarry adding over 3.5 million tons of aggregates annual production capacity and reducing our customers loading those cycle times. This project increases throughput at our flagship quarry in the fast growing Dallas/Fort Worth market. We will continue to prioritize high return capital projects to drive large expansion in 2022. We also returned $148 million to shareholders, reflecting our most recent dividend increase announced in August. Since a repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases, while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased 3.2 times as of December 31 reflecting the debt financed acquisition of Lehigh Hanson West in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past practice of reducing leverage following an acquisition, we expect debt ratio to be 2.5 times by year-end 2022. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2022 outlook.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. We're excited about Martin Marietta\u2019s opportunities for sustainable long-term success in 2022 and beyond, as we build on our momentum and capitalize on favorable market fundamentals and underlying secular demand trends. For the first time since our industry's most recent shipment peak in 2005 public and private construction activity are both poised to accelerate, supporting increased shipments and attractive multi-year pricing acceleration for construction materials. As we embark on what we view as this golden age of aggregates. Martin Marietta has the ability and capacity to supply these needed products underpinned by our locally that pricing strategy. We will continue to do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. The new Federal Infrastructure Law along with strong State Department of Transportation budgets in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and now California, provide Martin Marietta with a long awaited runway for multi-year growth in infrastructure demand. The recently enacted infrastructure investment in Jobs Act is the nation's most significant infrastructure action since the introduction of the Interstate Highway System in 1956. This bipartisan legislation contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization, plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, and other hard infrastructure projects. While this once in a generation investment in America's transportation networks stimulates economic growth and job creation immediately. We expect product demand benefits to begin in late 2022 and become more pronounced in 2023. This new law will naturally favorably impact our results over an extended period of time and we expect this legislation to result in healthy State Department of Transportation budgets with estimated lettings above prior levels. [Boarders] approved state and local transportation measures will also promote sustainable growth and product demand. In November of 2021, Boarders approved 89% of state and local transportation ballot measures. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $7 billion in both one-time and recurring transportation funding with initiatives in Texas are top revenue generating state, accounting for over $4 billion of this total, these measures tangibly demonstrate the commitment of state and local governments to ongoing efforts to repair and improve our nation's aging infrastructure. Importantly, DLTs for our top states are well equipped from both financial and resource perspective to put increased transportation dollars to work and advance the growing number of projects in their backlogs. We expect enhanced infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregates shipments to this end use closer to our 10-year historical average of 40% of total shipments for reference, aggregates to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of 2021 organic shipments. Non-residential construction should continue to benefit from e-commerce evolving work trends and supply chain complexities that drive increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses, data centers, and reshoring of manufacturing to the United States. Notably, commercial and retail construction throughout our [San Antonio] markets is poised to inflect in become a more significant demand driver in 2022 as it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregates to the non-residential market accounted for 35% of 2021 organic shipments. Residential construction remains robust, particularly for single-family housing, which is yet to return to normalize levels. The National Association of Homebuilders forecast 2022 single-family housing starts to be 25% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019 despite longer material delivery times and labor shortages, Martin Marietta\u2019s leading coast-to-coast footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given undergo conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics and accelerated de-urbanization. Single-Family Housing is two to three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction when factoring in the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of 2021 organic shipments. In summary, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. Organic aggregate shipments are anticipated to increase 1% to 4% in 2022 is contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continue to impact an otherwise robust demand environment underpinned by a value of a volume pricing strategy, we expect growth in organic aggregates pricing of 5% to 8%. Annual price increases become effective from January 1 to April 1 and have already garnered market support. While inflationary pressures remain, we expect to expand upstream gross margins in 2022, supported by pricing acceleration and disciplined cost control. Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, and a full-year results for acquired operations. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA for our continuing operations of $1.700 billion to $1.800 million. And to reiterate, our 2022 guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held-for-sale. To conclude we're extremely proud of our 2021 record setting safety, operational and financial performance supported by a growing demand environment and our consistently executed strategic priorities. We're confident in Martin Marietta\u2019s long-term prospects. Our team remains committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we built the safest, best performing and most durable aggregate slug public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum and delivering attractive growth and superior value for our shareholders in 2022 and beyond.  Operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. And if necessary get back in the queue for additional one. One moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms at Stephens. Your line is open.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nWard Nye: Good morning Trey.\nTrey Grooms: I wanted to first off Ward ask about your portfolio optimization efforts here. You're evaluating strategic alternatives for the California cement business and ready-mix. How are you thinking about that any color you can share with us on the strategic reasoning behind that and any kind of impact that you could color around that for these businesses you're looking at maybe moving out?\nWard Nye: Happy to try. Thank you for the question. If you think about what our business is going to look like and what we now refer to as the Pacific region, [indiscernible] we're done with what we're talking about, we'll have 17 aggregate locations there, we're going to have ready-mix in Arizona and we will have asphalt in California and Arizona. I think importantly, as we go back and take a look at from a tonnage or cubic yardage perspective, what that's going to look like, that's going to be around 13.5 million tons of stone in that marketplace, it's going to be about 1.1 million cubic yards, and run 8 million tons of asphalt. If you think back to the way that we've long spoken about our business Trey, you've heard us say, this is an aggregate slug company. And we do have a strategic cement business, but we have that in Texas. I think the strategic cement fits the way we've spoken up your Texas extraordinarily well. One of the things that we did identify for people, when we bought the Lehigh Hanson business is we were going to look at the cement business in particular to determine if we were the best owner. And after we closed on that transaction, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we received a number of inquiries from different parties interested in those businesses. From our perspective, we owe it to our shareholders and others to engage in that dialogue obviously part of what I've indicated, we anticipate having more for you on that here in the first half of the year. But again, from an aggregate slug perspective, we'd like this type of direction. The other thing that I think is so important to reiterate in California is well trend is we think the ability is very much ahead of us in that state to do more M&A on the aggregate side in California. And we think that's going to give us a very attractive long-term business. There obviously, we now have a platform position from which to grow. So Trey I hope that's helpful.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. And so you're keeping the aggregates business being aggregates led, obviously. But now that you've been in the driver's seat there for three or four months, any update you can give us around maybe the commercial efforts, particularly around the aggregates business there in California?\nWard Nye: No, I'm happy to. Trey, if we're looking at aggregate selling prices in that marketplace, generally, they tended to be about $0.70 a ton lower than Martin Marietta\u2019s overall pricing. So if we look at pillar when we bought that business in Minnesota, those prices were for below Martin Marietta so for the prices in California. So we're very focused commercially on getting that more in line. What we've done in California, I think this is important is we have been very intentional about going out with pricing increases in that market, effective January 1. And the price increases from the customer feedback and from what we're seeing very directly have been received favorably the trends are actually quite attractive. We've indicated ASP increases across the enterprise of up 5% to 8% would be disappointed if California didn't outperform that. And in fact, that by January does not make a year. That's certainly what we've seen thus far in January Trey. So I think the commercial undertakings that we've had in that state even with ownership just as in a matter of months actually gone quite well.\nTrey Grooms: Great. Thanks Ward. Thanks for taking my questions. Take care.\nWard Nye: You too Trey.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thomson with Thomson Research Group. Your line is open.\nKathryn Thomson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. Gave some great color just on end markets, but the one I'd like to focus in on a little bit more is on the commercial end market because that was one that we saw uncertainly you and others have started to see some improvement in the back half of 21\u2019. And given those are longer term projects in general, that can have a scaling, impact on pricing too. So really kind of the question on commercial is, what are you seeing in terms of trends? How does that impact pricing now and also in the future as you're able to price up higher? And a little bit with that, in particular from a geographic standpoint Texas has been strong, but it's just a place that didn't need to get stronger did and how that impacts commercial and pricing for all of your [ups] in that market too? Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet, Kathryn. Thank you. So several things. If we go back about a year ago, when we had our Analyst Investor Day SOAR of 2025 to a sustainable future. Part of what we were talking about is we believe the Single-Family Housing state over that million year start that we would see in particular, the light portion of non-res continued to grow. So now let's step back and assess what \u201822 looked like and how that forecast into \u201921. \u201822 was, or \u201821 was the only year and second year in our history where non-res volumes were more than infrastructure volumes were. So that tends to indicate that what we thought we were going to say see and what we outlined last February, in fact, happened throughout the year, meaning heavy non-res continued to be very good. It's incredibly aggregates intensive. And then as housing state solid, light non-res came behind that which led to the single largest end-use that we have. To your point, if we look at overall non-res in a state like Texas, the Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin Carter along I-35 continues to be incredibly strong. What we're seeing on that last mile delivery centers is impressive, you said it was hard to imagine that getting better and by the way, I'm there too. But as you noted, it has Samsung is looking to come in there with a $14 billion semiconductor plant in Austin, Texas Instruments is looking to build more in North Texas and Central Texas where we're seeing the high speed rail. So there are a number of projects on non-res that we think will continue to be really pretty most notable in that state. The other thing that we're seeing is obviously LNG has been on the sidelines for a while we anticipated that it would be at the same time we're looking at some jobs right now at Rio Grande LNG at Chevron Phillips, and [it\u2019s near] that we think might see some degree of go-- going into this year. So to your point, that's just in Texas. The other thing that's notable is even seeing what's happening with rig counts, I mean rig counts have clearly been down. But the rig count at 610 at the end of January, was actually up 226 rigs, year-over-year. So we're seeing more activity and energy as well. If we come back and look at other states, so that matter to us, whether it's Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, we continue to see very good activity is that called on prepared remarks on warehousing and distribution. But here's what we're seeing too and we're seeing this in North Carolina, we're seeing retail and hospitality sectors, beginning to inflect. And obviously, there's been some recent activity in North Carolina with respect to Apple and Google and then Toyota has also come into the Greensboro High Point area, which actually in North Carolina has been a bit of a laggard. And seeing that type of activity there is really quite refreshing. And then Atlanta continues to be a top five domestic warehousing and data center market, and it shows absolutely no sign of slowing. So we feel like non-res is attractive, it continues to be really durable. And I think part of what's changed Kathryn is the heavy side of non-res particulars we're looking at these distributions have become so aggregates intensive and we've discussed before they tend to be in many respects almost concrete envelopes. To your point, you're selling relatively high priced clean stone into those concrete operations. So again, your part of your question was not just what's happening with non-res but what could that do trending relative to pricing. And I do believe this non-res projects will continue to take more clean stone, if we look at the clean stone it's going to be a higher price. So I think all of it adds up to a very attractive near-term, probably medium-term outlook Kathryn.\nKathryn Thomson: Thank you very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.\nStanley Elliott: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you actually for taking the call and the question. Can I piggyback it on a comment you just made a second ago where you talked about being underbuilt from a residential standpoint. Lots of investor concerns now around affordability rate increases, et cetera. But how are you all balancing that? Or what are you seeing in your marketplace given that we were underbuilt or 7 million starts for 8-plus years?\nWard Nye: Stanley that's such a good point because there's so much that still needs to be made up in housing. And I think that's one of the reasons that we've been so focused in SOAR, not just in building our business, but where we're building our business. So you need to think about what's happening with populations and where they're going. So our view of several things. One, the underbuilt conditions that you just outlined, together with nice population dynamics, puts us in a really attractive spot. So here are some numbers that I think are worth thinking about  If we look at where seasonally adjusted rates for Single-Family Housing came in '21, it was around 1.1 million starts. Starts are in '22, around 1.2 million; in '23, 1.3 million and in '24, around 1.4 million. But here's the math that I think we find compelling. By the time we get to 1.4 million single starts, if these numbers are right, in 2024, 2 things worth remembering: one, that will be back to 2003 levels. So we will have been away from that for 20 years, and the U.S. is going to have 40 million more people. Now if we think about where those people are or where those people are going and we start thinking about the states that are impact states for Martin Marietta you think about them in orders being Texas and Colorado and North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now add in California. So if we look at a state like Texas, that's 34% of our sales, but we look at the overall population, it's about 30% of the population of the United States. If we look at that -- or we're looking at 29 million people in the state. If we're looking at North Carolina, now 10.6 million people in the state, but we're looking to add 2 million people to North Carolina by 2040. So again, if we're looking at population trends, even with a rising interest rate, you're still seeing historically low rates, and you're seeing people who simply need homes and people move into these parts of the United States that can afford the homes. So we don't think single-family home building is going to go up to the numbers where it was back in 2005, 2006, we don't think that it should. But we think this is a very sustainable level, and we think the sustainable level helps us not just on the housing because, as you know, that's 2 to 3 times more aggregates intensive than multi-family, but we think what that continues to do, going back to the previous question, on non-res is really very attractive Stanley. So a lot of data, but it's our way of saying we feel like housing for our business in our leading state is going to be very durable for a while.\nStanley Elliott: Prefect. Thanks so much. And best of luck.\nWard Nye: Thanks Stanley.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: You're guiding CapEx up roughly $100 million year-over-year in '22. I'm just -- is that primarily Lehigh and Tiller? And are there any major kind of growth projects that you'd call out as part of the '22 CapEx guide? And any kind of rough view on how we should think about CapEx long term.\nJim Nickolas: Yes, yes. It's Jim. Good morning. The answer is it\u2019s mostly organic business. It's not Lehigh Hanson assets predominantly. The main project in 2022 is what we've outlined before is the large capacity expansion to melon. We refer to it as a -- that is the large projects that we've got going on next -- this year in 2022. So that's the main one. We expect to have a very high return on that one, especially given the pricing outlook that we're seeing for cement in that market. So that's going to be I think, a very high returning project for us. Otherwise, as I think about it in total, for modeling purposes, I think 9% of sales roughly is generally how I think about this business over time, and we're not too far off that, I think, in 2022.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Anthony.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thanks for having me on. I was just wondering if you could speak to infrastructure demand for this year and specifically just with some of the reports out of D.C. with delays in federal funding just given the lack of a full year federal budget. Are you anticipating any headwinds associated with that in your 2022 guide? And maybe speak more broadly as to the level of confidence that the projects that you thought are going to be moving forward with the passage of the infrastructure bill, the level of confidence that they're going to continue to move forward as expected?\nWard Nye: Thanks so much for the question, Garik. We feel pretty good about that. So a couple of things to think about. One, the new build is the law now. So the appropriations process has to go through its normal deal. As I think if you go back and look at the appropriations process, number one, they're negotiating it right now. Number two, if we go back and look at history, the latest that, that's ever found common ground is early in May, which puts it comfortably ahead of the next fiscal year for the government. The other thing that I think is so important to remember is $118 billion was deposited into the Highway Trust Fund, and it's lockbox. So we know that money is going to be there. So if you think of it, from a federal perspective through that lens, I think it gives you a pretty good foundation. I think then when you pivot and take a couple of other things into account: one, you still got significant COVID funding that's going to find its way into the system this year. And then thirdly, the last leg of that store, I would say is simply where the different DOTs themselves are. So again, if we look at the DOTs that are the DOTs that matter most to Martin Marietta, again, it's going to be Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California. In Texas, we're looking at FY '22 lettings that are expected to exceed $10 billion, and that's going to be the highest in 5 years. If we look in Colorado, they recently passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill, ensuring a consistent stream of funding in that state through FY '23. If we're looking here in our backyard in North Carolina, FY '22 lettings have returned to historic levels. And if we're looking at the recently passed state biennium budget here in North Carolina, it's investing heavily in transportation with about $4.2 billion in FY '22. Similarly, in Georgia, we're looking for an expected increase of around $200 million or about 12%. In Florida, minings were up almost $2 billion. And again, the story in California well, with a $17 billion [California\u2019s] budget. And we think with where SB1 is providing $50 billion of total spending through 2030, with about 3.7% of it going directly to highways and streets on an annual basis. We think that combination of the money that's been black box, what we think is going to be a fairly navigable appropriations process with the COVID money that's there and with what I've just outlined on those top 5, 6 states for North Carolina, we like what we're seeing relative to infrastructure and we believe that's going to be, Garik.\nGarik Shmois: Great. I appreciate. That\u2019s help enough.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Garik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Can we just go back to the Lehigh assets again? And I believe those that are remaining are now incorporated into guidance. But if you can just help us understand maybe the split between the sales that are -- sales and EBITDA that are in your guidance versus what is being held-for-sale? And then also, if you can talk about just how those assets are performing. I guess I would have expected the aggregates volume growth -- or sorry, pricing growth associated with the Lehigh business to be growing a little bit faster than the overall business. So if you could just help us think about how that's performing relative to the business overall? Thanks.\nWard Nye: Happy too. Courtney, thank you for the question. So I'm going to take the last part of your question first. And by the way, wholeheartedly agree with you. And that as I indicated early on, if we're looking at the Pacific business and we're looking at overall aggregate selling prices there, I think what we've indicated is they tend to be about $0.70 a ton lower than heritage Martin Marietta. We've said across the board, you should expect ASP increases of 5% to 8%. And what I'm indicating is we should expect California to outperform that. And frankly, if California is not seeing low double-digit price increases, I would be disappointed in that. So I think that's totally consistent with your thinking. And again, while January there's not a year make, we certainly like the numbers that we've seen in January. If we think about what EBITDA contribution is going to look like in that group, here's the way I would encourage you to think of it. We've indicated again, we're going to be an aggregates-led business there with around 13 million tons of stone. We will have a ready-mix business in Arizona, and we will have hot mix in California and Arizona. And if you think about EBITDA contribution, about 70% of the EBITDA contribution is going to be from aggregates in that business around 18% will be from ready-mix and around 13% will be from asphalt. So if you go back and look historically at what would have been cement business in California, together with a ready-mix business in California and simply take those out. And we put some pies together for you when we announced that transaction, showing how much was cement and aggregates and ready-mix and hot mix because at that point, we were talking about the upstream portion of it. And now what you're seeing in upstream at that time, by the way, Courtney, meant both aggregates and cement. Now we're talking about a business that with nearly 70% of the EBITDA being from aggregates is in the lexicon that we typically use an aggregates-led business, which is what we're looking to number one, have in that state. But Courtney, I think even more importantly, that's what we intend to keep building in that state. They are independent players there. There's a lot of potential M&A activity that's already underway in California. And so I'm trying to give you a snapshot of what it was, what it is right now. And what it is right now from an aggregate side perspective, we believe, will become even heavier.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Thanks. And maybe -- could you just maybe just quantify how much that EBITDA contribution is from the acquisition? And then how much of that is now in discontinued operations? And if you could also just comment if there's any synergies as a result of the deal that we should be thinking about on either SG&A or other line items?\nWard Nye: Since it was a carve-out, really the synergies that will come from that transaction will be what we bring to it operationally, which we're in the process of doing and what we're doing commercially. And I think the commercial efforts are already evident. Relative to broken out EBITDA, we've actually not given that. I think if you go back and look at some of the information that we gave at the time relative to the Lehigh Hanson transaction and Tiller because we spoke about those in connection with each other. I think you can probably back into some of that, but we certainly had some arrangements with buyers and sellers that we would not talk about some of those numbers with greater specificity. So I'm not intending to be clever with you, not at all. I apologize on that. But I think overall, you can back into likely where those are. But again, because you're not buying a public company, moving offices, et cetera, and it's a carve-out, the synergies end up being more commercial and operational excellence over time.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just lastly, on the volume guidance. I think you made some comments that you're still seeing some constraints due to labor shortages and the demand environment. And can you just help us think about your volume expectations for 1% to 4% growth, how much of that is being constrained by some of the supply chain issues that we're seeing in the market? And whether you're baking in any improvement in the back half of the year?\nWard Nye: There's going to be improvement. It will be in the back half of the year. I think a good example that we've been able to use in the past, Courtney, is we could probably see in the mid-single digits from a volume perspective, higher, for example, in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. almost on a daily basis than we're seeing right now simply because of the lack of trucks. So I think if we look at supply chains right now, primarily, it's one of logistics. It's how quickly can people bringing their trucks or how efficient can rail be in moving product. Overall, supply chain on labor for us is not a particular issue right now. Our supply chain itself is so domestically oriented. We haven't struggled with that. And equally, we're not struggling with putting adequate product on the ground. So we believe we can meet the demand. We believe we can do it in a very low cost way. We do think we're going to be in a position that we can assure that we're getting fair value for our products. But I do think the single largest challenge will continue to be transportation logistics. And we do believe there will likely be some degree of ease on that in the second half of the year. But I would tell you, we have not built that in. And the other thing that we have done, Courtney, and this is probably relative to say, in our pricing letters for this year, we have indicated to our customers that they should prepare for midyear price increases from us. At the same time, we have not factored that in to any of the guidance that we've given you. So do I think there's potentially some upside relative to logistic easing in half 2, I do. And when I tell you very candidly, we've told customers to, in many respects, you prepare for midyears, and that's not in our numbers, that would be grown.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Great. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Courtney.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning gentlemen.\nWard Nye: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Ward, the other hot topic certainly is inflation. There is a pretty aggressive print this morning on CPI. How is -- how do you see it from your angle internally? Are customers getting worried? And generally, when you put out your guidance for 2022, what were the levers or thoughts relative to energy materials? And is there any easing of that as we move throughout 2020? And what you're expecting for the year?\nWard Nye: Mike, thank you very much for the question. What I'm going to do is turn that over to Jim. I want him to walk you through what we're seeing relative to the labor M&R. And in particular, what we're seeing with respect to diesel. The short answer, at least from my perspective, goes back though to the prepared remarks and push said, we expect to see better margins in our upstream materials business this year than we did last year. So that's going to give you the punchline. But let me let Jim walk you through at least what we're seeing in some discrete areas of the business.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. Sure. So the labor services component is probably around 5%. The other elements, which are smaller, slice of the cost pie supplies, 5% to 10%; repairs and maintenance, probably 5% to 10% as well. But obviously, the main component of what we sell is our stone, that is -- we own that. There's no -- and we source that from the ground. So that's going to help with the inflationary environment as well. So those costs are going up, but it's a smaller portion of our total cogs pie than other areas. And so on the aggregate piece, we're going to be growing margins, as Ward said overall. But again, those are the rough ways of thinking about it. Diesel in particular is the one, it was a headwind this year for 2021. We expect it to be a headwind in 2022. We've built in around $25 million of additional diesel costs in 2022. We're hoping that's not enough. It looks like it is right now, but we'll modify that if we need to.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.\nWard Nye: Good morning Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I wonder if you could talk about the length of your backlog in infrastructure based on the lettings that we're tracking, looks like we're above 2019 levels in terms of what's been awarded to your customers. Has that translated to your backlogs recovering to where they were when we were talking about them in 2018 -- in 2019? And in terms of the pricing associated with some longer-term work, were you folks able to get out in front of the inflation in terms of putting through significant price increases on longer-term work specifically that's been awarded to you over the past 6 months?\nWard Nye: Fair enough, Jerry. So keep in mind, even on longer-term work, historically, at least over the last decade, we would have been building in price increases on longer-term work on an annual basis. So do we anticipate those price increases in the future of being greater than some of them have been in the past. The short answer is yes. If we're looking overall at backlog, customer backlog, and that's the important way to try to remember it, what we're looking at right now is the backlog in aggregates, that's about 14% ahead of where it was in prior year. And if I'm breaking it down even more granularly, what you'll find is in the East Group, it's up around 17% versus prior year and the West Group is up around 10% versus prior year. So I'm particularly heartened by that because as you'll recall, that East Group, which is a pure Stone business tends to have the highest margins in the company. and they also have the largest backlogs in the aggregates group. The other thing that I think is worth adding to it as well, Jerry, is as we're looking at what's going on in MAG Specialties, they've got record backlogs across their business as well. Obviously, the chemicals portion of that business is doing exceedingly well. It clearly had a few cost headwinds relative to natural gas and some degree of what was going to the steel business for a portion of Q4. And so it's always interesting to me when margins in that business are taking down a little bit to 38.5%. That tends to give people's attention, but it's a solid 40% margin business, and customer backlogs in that business are records. And again, in aggregates they are up nicely ahead of prior year. And again, we're talking about midyears on those as well. We do protect customers on the pricing that they've had in the past, but we do expect to get midyear this year, and we expect the midyear to be attracted.\nJerry Revich: Yes. If only all business was bottomed at 38.5% margins. Thanks.\nWard Nye: You bet, Jerry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Feniger: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just you mentioned the margin expansion in the upstream business in aggregate, can you just help us understand the cadence there? I mean, diesel, energy prices are still kind of elevated right now on a year-over-year basis. So how should we be thinking about just 2022? Is it -- are we down a little bit in the first half, reflecting in the second half to get it up full year? Just how should we kind of think about the cadence through the year?\nWard Nye:\nthis stuff:\nJim Nickolas: Sure. So Michael, we don't give out quarterly guidance. So I'm going to stick with sort of somatic ways of thinking about it. Back-end loaded, profit-wise, that is true, more than historically we've seen for two reasons, really. One, our price increases are larger this year than they were last year, and those are largely effective ever one. So first quarter this year still hasn't really got the ticker from the accelerating price increases. So that effect is slightly delayed. Two, the diesel headwinds that you mentioned, those are more pronounced in the first half of the year than they will be in the second half of the year. So those are the two main reasons we're seeing gross profits will be back-end weighted versus historical patterns.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson , Davis. I\u2019m sorry, if I mispronounced Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: You are good. Thank you. Good morning, guys.\nWard Nye: Good morning.\nAdam Thalhimer: Ward, if I've gotten any pushback this morning, it's maybe on the volume guidance, particularly around the low end of -- could you maybe comment on upside, downside risk to the volume outlook for this year?\nWard Nye: What if you think back to it, Adam, that's exactly where we came out last February, too, right? And we said 1% to 4%. And obviously, we finished the year on the high end of that. If we're looking at overall total. And keep in mind, the 1% to 4% is on the organic. If we're looking overall, we're talking 7% to 10%. So what I would say is, I think back to the dialogue I was having a few moments ago, can we meet the demand? Yes. Can we meet the spec requirements? Yes. Can we do that almost anywhere we need in the United States? The short answer is yes. If you can give me a good snapshot of what's going to happen with transportation and logistics, I can probably tell you what's going to happen relative to volume. So if we're right that we're going to see some degree of easing logistically and have to Frankly, I think that certainly is trending you towards the higher end of that. But if we think about what the issues are that may make that slower, it's not going to be an issue of demand and it's not going to be an issue of our ability to meet the demand. It's going to be what's happening relative to third parties and their ability to move this down.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTimna Tanners: Yes, hello everyone. How are doing?\nWard Nye: Great. [indiscernible] hear your voice.\nTimna Tanners: Likewise. Hey, just wanted to explore a little bit more the capital allocation comments, in particular, you mentioned of buybacks, but we haven't really seen much yet. So I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about what you think about in terms of deploying that? And how you think about -- obviously, you keep flagging the opportunity to grow more. And I'm just wondering the timing of further acquisitions, I assume that's just a question of availability. But are you looking at a particular leverage goal, debt leverage well before you deploy any of those opportunities? Thanks a lot.\nWard Nye: Well, again, I'm going to kick that over to Jim. As part of what Jim told you in his prepared comments, basically looking at the business, as we're looking at it right now, we're going to be back to our 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of the year. So as you can tell, this is a business that de-levers very quickly. If you think about our overall capital priorities, the short answer is, Timna, they haven't changed over time. I'd ask Jim to walk you through those, but M&A continues to be one that's been coming to us. But Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So we wouldn't pass on an acquisition today if it came through based on our leverage. We have the ability to go after that opportunity and still deleverage. So that's not a roadblock for us at this point. And as we've mentioned, we do expect to get to 2.5 times by year-end on a net basis. And even with that in mind, we will take a balanced approach to our capital -- so whether we buy back shares, that's on off the table this year, either even with those things, M&A and share buyback, et cetera, increasing dividend, hopefully in August. That is all in the cards, even with our leverage where it's at. That's all contemplated with our stated forecasted end of year net leverage of 2.5 times. So hopefully that answers your question.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nDavid MacGregor: Hi, good morning everyone. I just wanted to ask about -- just to build on -- you're answering to a previous question about the volume guidance of 1% to 4% and maybe this reflects the backlog, but do you expect more growth in the East versus the West? Can you just talk about how you're thinking about east versus west in that 1% to 4%? And then I guess just my question with respect to cement would be just on the profitability for 2022. It seems like the volume upside is pretty limited. You're running those 2 plants pretty close to full capacity now, I would guess. So is it all just price cost at this stage? Or is there something else we should think about in terms of profitability, in terms of the puts and takes on profitability for 2022 cement.\nWard Nye: David, thanks for the question. Good morning to you. So a couple of things. One, if we think about the way the country has recovered over the last several years, the East really took a harder fall in the downturn than the Southwest and in some respects on the West. So we've seen markets like Atlanta recovering more vodantly right now as well as the Carolinas and up into Virginia. And now we're seeing a very attractive recovery in Maryland as well. So if I'm looking at east versus west broadly, I am thinking we're likely to see a more snap back in the East in many respects than we are in the heritage West. I think California is going to be an attractive market for us. But again, I'm comforted by the fact that we're seeing good activity in the East. With respect to your cement question, look, you're internally right, I mean we're tapped out in many respects at about 4 million tons right now. Obviously, we're adding capacity to what we're doing in Texas with the FM 7 capital project that Jim spoke to before. I guess several things. One, our efficiencies were not necessarily helped last year by that decrease that occurred last February. So David, as you may recall, I know you're accustomed to it in Cleveland, but in Dallas and San Antonio, they're not accustomed to the type of weather that they had last year. That was there for an extended period of time that really not only slowed down sales, slowdown production and actually caused an oversized degree of M&R. We don't think that's going to recur. So we do believe there are going to be efficiencies that simply come from that. If we're looking overall at what we think is going to happen relative to pricing, Again, we saw multiple price increases last year in cement. Right now, we're looking at a $12 a ton increase in April. I think the other thing that can be a bit of a swing factor there, David, is where is some of that going to be as well. Obviously, DFW is a very healthy market, so is Central Texas. But part of what we saw in the quarter was more material heading to West Texas. Now granted, percentages in this concept sounds really big tonnages are huge. So if we're looking at quarter percentages changes, we saw 215% more material head to West Texas. Now what does that mean? Is there a practical matter? 37,000 tons went to West Texas in the quarter versus 12,000 tons in the previous quarter. But as we look at average selling price on those, that's at an average selling price of around $203 a ton versus a total cement all-in number of $127. So I would say several things. Do we anticipate a better year operation in Texas than we had last year? Absent another deep freeze, the answer is yes. Do we anticipate a better pricing environment across the state? The answer is yes. And do we anticipate seeing more material, not massive amounts, but more going into West Texas year-over-year? The answer to that is yes as well, David. So I hope that helps.\nOperator: All right. Moving to our last question from Zane Karimi with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nZane Karimi: Hey, good morning guys.\nWard Nye: Hi, Zane.\nZane Karimi: Thanks for the color so far. And then an extension on Courtney's question earlier, but I was just wanted to dive into the new regions that you're now in with the California and Arizona from the Lehigh transaction. And in particular, get a better picture on any sort of new challenges you're experiencing in these spots? Any sort of labor constraints that are new or supply deficiencies or the challenges that you experienced in the region?\nWard Nye: That's a great question, Zane. And the good news is, look, we've had a highly enthusiastic team there that's delighted to be part of Martin Marietta. One of the things that I outlined early on is we achieved world-class safety metrics on both lost time and total case despite the fact that we had really one of the largest years of M&A in our company's history. The reason that I start out with that is that, to us, is so cultural and so important. And when we have colleagues who appreciate the importance of that to us, that's a really good starting point. I think something that we have clearly brought to that though, and I think it goes back to the portfolio optimization efforts. We are, first and foremost, in aggregates business. So what I would tell you is we're assuring that our new colleagues in California understand that, that is for us the alpha and the mega of what this business is in so many respects. And being superb operationally is going to be important and vital and absolutely who we are. Now from a timing perspective, saying, as you would imagine, getting operational improvements isn't as immediate at times as you can get commercial improvements. So what are we happy with? We're very happy to see that the training that we put in place, the timing that we put in place and otherwise relative to commercial activity has worked really well. Do we have work ahead of us relative to bringing these sites up to Martin Marietta operational levels? We do. And actually, that's what I see is the good news part of it because we think there's nice things that can be done with this business, not over the near-term, but near, medium and long. The other piece, and it's not so much a challenge, but it's realistic is we need to make sure that the people who are in that state in business in that state know who we are because relationships are important, and we want to grow our business in that state. And we want to grow our business, first and foremost, in the aggregates line of it. So again, no big surprises there. I think very much what we thought and importantly, the areas that we thought we could make some refinements that can make a difference have been happening so far. So I've been saying thank you for that question, and I hope that response is helpful.\nZane Karimi: Yes. Very much, sir. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet.\nWard Nye: Well, it looks like that's the end of the questions for today. So thank you all for joining today's earnings call. Underpinned by our disciplined execution of our proven strategy and our long-standing capital allocation priorities, we're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving sustainable growth and superior shareholder value as we saw it to a sustainable future. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2022 results in just a few months. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay well.\nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta's diligent execution of our strategic operating analysis and review plan otherwise known as SOAR has been and continues to be the foundation of our long-term success differentiating us from our competitors. This year was no exception as our impressive 2021 results continue to underscore the importance of disciplined strategic planning combined with functional excellence. Our team steadfast commitment to our strategic priorities enabled Martin Marietta to extend our proven track record of delivering industry leading safety, growth and financial performance for our shareholders. Among our accomplishments, in 2021, we achieved the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. This year marked our 10th consecutive year of increases in consolidated product and services revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted share. We also made significant progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives, among them, successfully completing more than $3 billion in value enhancing acquisitions. These transactions expanded our product offerings and attractive new and existing markets, establishing a formidable coast-to-coast geographic footprint supported by robust underlying demand we will continue to build on these achievements with a focus on delivering sustainable, long-term operational and financial success in 2022 and beyond. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter and portfolio optimization efforts. Pricing momentum and growing product shipments aided in part by mild weather extending the 2021 construction season provided a strong finish to the year. We completed the acquisition of the Lehigh Hanson's West Region business on October 1, which provides Martin Marietta with new growth platforms in three of the nation's largest mega regions in California and Arizona and will serve as a valuable platform for continued expansion in the years ahead. And finally, in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 27% increase in products and services revenues and a 17.5% increase in adjusted EBITDA capping-off a 12-month period of continued growth, robust M&A activity and record setting financial performance. Consistent with our SOAR 2025 priorities, we continually look for ways to optimize our portfolio through asset swaps and divestitures. To that end, following the closing of the Lehigh Hanson West acquisition, we received expressions of interest in the California based cement and concrete operations. As we focus on the product mix of our business to enhance value for our shareholders, we're currently evaluating alternatives for these operations and have classified these assets as held-for-sale. We anticipate providing more clarity regarding our plans for these assets during the first half of 2022. As I noted earlier, for the full year 2021, we established new financial records marking the 10th consecutive year of growth in each of the following metrics, products and services revenues increased 15% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 10% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.53 billion increased 10% year-over-year or 14% excluding non-recurring gains and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $12.28 grew 6% year-over-year or 13% excluding non-recurring gains. I'm especially pleased to note that Martin Marietta's strong earnings growth and thoughtful SOAR execution provided our investors with a total shareholder return of 56% in 2021 more than double the S&P 500. Operating our business safely sets the foundation for achieving longstanding financial success. I'm proud to report that we achieved a company wide world class last time and some great for the fifth consecutive year with a 7% reduction in the total reportable incidents Martin Marietta also reported a total entry incident rate of 0.8 rate of 0.84 exceeding world class rate levels for the first time in our history. Even more rewarding is that our strong 2021 safety performance includes the safety results of our newly acquired operations. I'm incredibly grateful to our employees both new and tenured who embrace Martin Marietta's guardian and angel culture each and every day. With that overview, let's now turn to the full year operating performance. The building materials business experienced solid product demand across our geographic footprint, driven by single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and continued strengthen warehouses and data centers. Organic aggregate shipments increased nearly 4% to 193 million tones in line with the high end of our original 2021 guidance for volume growth and above 2019 pre -COVID levels. Acquired operations contributed an additional 8 million tons. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 3% with realized price increases partially offset by higher sales of lower price base and excess fuel material shipments in the second half of 2021. Importantly, all divisions contributed to this growth. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive, underpinned by market support prior announced price increases and overall customer confidence we anticipate being well positioned commercially and otherwise to respond to strong demand and more than offset inflationary headwinds in 2022. Our Texas cement business grew modestly to 4 million tons, establishing a new record for shipments supported by large projects, recovering energy sector activity and incremental pull-through from our interim downstream customers. Cement pricing grew 7% following multiple pricing increases during the year as the largest cement producer in Texas. Our cement operations are well positioned to continue to benefit from tight supply and healthy demand supported by diversified customer backlogs and our announced April 2022 price increase of $12 per ton. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, organic ready-mix concrete shipments increased 16% reflecting the healthy Texas and Colorado demand environment, pricing grew modestly. Despite solid fourth quarter volume improvement our Colorado asphalt and paving business was unable to overcome shipment declines from weather challenges and liquid asphalt supply disruptions that hindered construction activity during the traditionally productive summer months. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to conclude our full year 2021 discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim. Thanks, Jim. We're excited about Martin Marietta's opportunities for sustainable long-term success in 2022 and beyond, as we build on our momentum and capitalize on favorable market fundamentals and underlying secular demand trends. For the first time since our industry's most recent shipment peak in 2005 public and private construction activity are both poised to accelerate, supporting increased shipments and attractive multi-year pricing acceleration for construction materials. As we embark on what we view as this golden age of aggregates. Martin Marietta has the ability and capacity to supply these needed products underpinned by our locally that pricing strategy. We will continue to do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. The new Federal Infrastructure Law along with strong State Department of Transportation budgets in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and now California, provide Martin Marietta with a long awaited runway for multi-year growth in infrastructure demand. The recently enacted infrastructure investment in Jobs Act is the nation's most significant infrastructure action since the introduction of the Interstate Highway System in 1956. This bipartisan legislation contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization, plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, and other hard infrastructure projects. While this once in a generation investment in America's transportation networks stimulates economic growth and job creation immediately. We expect product demand benefits to begin in late 2022 and become more pronounced in 2023. This new law will naturally favorably impact our results over an extended period of time and we expect this legislation to result in healthy State Department of Transportation budgets with estimated lettings above prior levels. [Boarders] approved state and local transportation measures will also promote sustainable growth and product demand. In November of 2021, Boarders approved 89% of state and local transportation ballot measures. These initiatives are estimated to generate an additional $7 billion in both one-time and recurring transportation funding with initiatives in Texas are top revenue generating state, accounting for over $4 billion of this total, these measures tangibly demonstrate the commitment of state and local governments to ongoing efforts to repair and improve our nation's aging infrastructure. Importantly, DLTs for our top states are well equipped from both financial and resource perspective to put increased transportation dollars to work and advance the growing number of projects in their backlogs. We expect enhanced infrastructure investment to provide volume stability and drive aggregates shipments to this end use closer to our 10-year historical average of 40% of total shipments for reference, aggregates to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of 2021 organic shipments. Non-residential construction should continue to benefit from e-commerce evolving work trends and supply chain complexities that drive increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses, data centers, and reshoring of manufacturing to the United States. Notably, commercial and retail construction throughout our [San Antonio] markets is poised to inflect in become a more significant demand driver in 2022 as it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregates to the non-residential market accounted for 35% of 2021 organic shipments. Residential construction remains robust, particularly for single-family housing, which is yet to return to normalize levels. The National Association of Homebuilders forecast 2022 single-family housing starts to be 25% higher than pre-pandemic levels in 2019 despite longer material delivery times and labor shortages, Martin Marietta's leading coast-to-coast footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given undergo conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics and accelerated de-urbanization. Single-Family Housing is two to three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction when factoring in the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs of new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of 2021 organic shipments. In summary, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. Organic aggregate shipments are anticipated to increase 1% to 4% in 2022 is contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continue to impact an otherwise robust demand environment underpinned by a value of a volume pricing strategy, we expect growth in organic aggregates pricing of 5% to 8%. Annual price increases become effective from January 1 to April 1 and have already garnered market support. While inflationary pressures remain, we expect to expand upstream gross margins in 2022, supported by pricing acceleration and disciplined cost control. Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses, and a full-year results for acquired operations. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA for our continuing operations of $1.700 billion to $1.800 million. And to reiterate, our 2022 guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held-for-sale. To conclude we're extremely proud of our 2021 record setting safety, operational and financial performance supported by a growing demand environment and our consistently executed strategic priorities. We're confident in Martin Marietta's long-term prospects. Our team remains committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we built the safest, best performing and most durable aggregate slug public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum and delivering attractive growth and superior value for our shareholders in 2022 and beyond.  Operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Good morning Trey. Happy to try. Thank you for the question. If you think about what our business is going to look like and what we now refer to as the Pacific region, [indiscernible] we're done with what we're talking about, we'll have 17 aggregate locations there, we're going to have ready-mix in Arizona and we will have asphalt in California and Arizona. I think importantly, as we go back and take a look at from a tonnage or cubic yardage perspective, what that's going to look like, that's going to be around 13.5 million tons of stone in that marketplace, it's going to be about 1.1 million cubic yards, and run 8 million tons of asphalt. If you think back to the way that we've long spoken about our business Trey, you've heard us say, this is an aggregate slug company. And we do have a strategic cement business, but we have that in Texas. I think the strategic cement fits the way we've spoken up your Texas extraordinarily well. One of the things that we did identify for people, when we bought the Lehigh Hanson business is we were going to look at the cement business in particular to determine if we were the best owner. And after we closed on that transaction, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we received a number of inquiries from different parties interested in those businesses. From our perspective, we owe it to our shareholders and others to engage in that dialogue obviously part of what I've indicated, we anticipate having more for you on that here in the first half of the year. But again, from an aggregate slug perspective, we'd like this type of direction. The other thing that I think is so important to reiterate in California is well trend is we think the ability is very much ahead of us in that state to do more M&A on the aggregate side in California. And we think that's going to give us a very attractive long-term business. There obviously, we now have a platform position from which to grow. So Trey I hope that's helpful. No, I'm happy to. Trey, if we're looking at aggregate selling prices in that marketplace, generally, they tended to be about $0.70 a ton lower than Martin Marietta's overall pricing. So if we look at pillar when we bought that business in Minnesota, those prices were for below Martin Marietta so for the prices in California. So we're very focused commercially on getting that more in line. What we've done in California, I think this is important is we have been very intentional about going out with pricing increases in that market, effective January 1. And the price increases from the customer feedback and from what we're seeing very directly have been received favorably the trends are actually quite attractive. We've indicated ASP increases across the enterprise of up 5% to 8% would be disappointed if California didn't outperform that. And in fact, that by January does not make a year. That's certainly what we've seen thus far in January Trey. So I think the commercial undertakings that we've had in that state even with ownership just as in a matter of months actually gone quite well. You too Trey. You bet, Kathryn. Thank you. So several things. If we go back about a year ago, when we had our Analyst Investor Day SOAR of 2025 to a sustainable future. Part of what we were talking about is we believe the Single-Family Housing state over that million year start that we would see in particular, the light portion of non-res continued to grow. So now let's step back and assess what \u201822 looked like and how that forecast into '21. \u201822 was, or \u201821 was the only year and second year in our history where non-res volumes were more than infrastructure volumes were. So that tends to indicate that what we thought we were going to say see and what we outlined last February, in fact, happened throughout the year, meaning heavy non-res continued to be very good. It's incredibly aggregates intensive. And then as housing state solid, light non-res came behind that which led to the single largest end-use that we have. To your point, if we look at overall non-res in a state like Texas, the Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin Carter along I-35 continues to be incredibly strong. What we're seeing on that last mile delivery centers is impressive, you said it was hard to imagine that getting better and by the way, I'm there too. But as you noted, it has Samsung is looking to come in there with a $14 billion semiconductor plant in Austin, Texas Instruments is looking to build more in North Texas and Central Texas where we're seeing the high speed rail. So there are a number of projects on non-res that we think will continue to be really pretty most notable in that state. The other thing that we're seeing is obviously LNG has been on the sidelines for a while we anticipated that it would be at the same time we're looking at some jobs right now at Rio Grande LNG at Chevron Phillips, and [it's near] that we think might see some degree of go-- going into this year. So to your point, that's just in Texas. The other thing that's notable is even seeing what's happening with rig counts, I mean rig counts have clearly been down. But the rig count at 610 at the end of January, was actually up 226 rigs, year-over-year. So we're seeing more activity and energy as well. If we come back and look at other states, so that matter to us, whether it's Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, we continue to see very good activity is that called on prepared remarks on warehousing and distribution. But here's what we're seeing too and we're seeing this in North Carolina, we're seeing retail and hospitality sectors, beginning to inflect. And obviously, there's been some recent activity in North Carolina with respect to Apple and Google and then Toyota has also come into the Greensboro High Point area, which actually in North Carolina has been a bit of a laggard. And seeing that type of activity there is really quite refreshing. And then Atlanta continues to be a top five domestic warehousing and data center market, and it shows absolutely no sign of slowing. So we feel like non-res is attractive, it continues to be really durable. And I think part of what's changed Kathryn is the heavy side of non-res particulars we're looking at these distributions have become so aggregates intensive and we've discussed before they tend to be in many respects almost concrete envelopes. To your point, you're selling relatively high priced clean stone into those concrete operations. So again, your part of your question was not just what's happening with non-res but what could that do trending relative to pricing. And I do believe this non-res projects will continue to take more clean stone, if we look at the clean stone it's going to be a higher price. So I think all of it adds up to a very attractive near-term, probably medium-term outlook Kathryn. Thank you. Stanley that's such a good point because there's so much that still needs to be made up in housing. And I think that's one of the reasons that we've been so focused in SOAR, not just in building our business, but where we're building our business. So you need to think about what's happening with populations and where they're going. So our view of several things. One, the underbuilt conditions that you just outlined, together with nice population dynamics, puts us in a really attractive spot. So here are some numbers that I think are worth thinking about  If we look at where seasonally adjusted rates for Single-Family Housing came in '21, it was around 1.1 million starts. Starts are in '22, around 1.2 million; in '23, 1.3 million and in '24, around 1.4 million. But here's the math that I think we find compelling. By the time we get to 1.4 million single starts, if these numbers are right, in 2024, 2 things worth remembering: one, that will be back to 2003 levels. So we will have been away from that for 20 years, and the U.S. is going to have 40 million more people. Now if we think about where those people are or where those people are going and we start thinking about the states that are impact states for Martin Marietta you think about them in orders being Texas and Colorado and North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now add in California. So if we look at a state like Texas, that's 34% of our sales, but we look at the overall population, it's about 30% of the population of the United States. If we look at that -- or we're looking at 29 million people in the state. If we're looking at North Carolina, now 10.6 million people in the state, but we're looking to add 2 million people to North Carolina by 2040. So again, if we're looking at population trends, even with a rising interest rate, you're still seeing historically low rates, and you're seeing people who simply need homes and people move into these parts of the United States that can afford the homes. So we don't think single-family home building is going to go up to the numbers where it was back in 2005, 2006, we don't think that it should. But we think this is a very sustainable level, and we think the sustainable level helps us not just on the housing because, as you know, that's 2 to 3 times more aggregates intensive than multi-family, but we think what that continues to do, going back to the previous question, on non-res is really very attractive Stanley. So a lot of data, but it's our way of saying we feel like housing for our business in our leading state is going to be very durable for a while. Thanks Stanley. Good morning, Anthony. Thanks, Anthony. Thanks so much for the question, Garik. We feel pretty good about that. So a couple of things to think about. One, the new build is the law now. So the appropriations process has to go through its normal deal. As I think if you go back and look at the appropriations process, number one, they're negotiating it right now. Number two, if we go back and look at history, the latest that, that's ever found common ground is early in May, which puts it comfortably ahead of the next fiscal year for the government. The other thing that I think is so important to remember is $118 billion was deposited into the Highway Trust Fund, and it's lockbox. So we know that money is going to be there. So if you think of it, from a federal perspective through that lens, I think it gives you a pretty good foundation. I think then when you pivot and take a couple of other things into account: one, you still got significant COVID funding that's going to find its way into the system this year. And then thirdly, the last leg of that store, I would say is simply where the different DOTs themselves are. So again, if we look at the DOTs that are the DOTs that matter most to Martin Marietta, again, it's going to be Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California. In Texas, we're looking at FY '22 lettings that are expected to exceed $10 billion, and that's going to be the highest in 5 years. If we look in Colorado, they recently passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill, ensuring a consistent stream of funding in that state through FY '23. If we're looking here in our backyard in North Carolina, FY '22 lettings have returned to historic levels. And if we're looking at the recently passed state biennium budget here in North Carolina, it's investing heavily in transportation with about $4.2 billion in FY '22. Similarly, in Georgia, we're looking for an expected increase of around $200 million or about 12%. In Florida, minings were up almost $2 billion. And again, the story in California well, with a $17 billion [California's] budget. And we think with where SB1 is providing $50 billion of total spending through 2030, with about 3.7% of it going directly to highways and streets on an annual basis. We think that combination of the money that's been black box, what we think is going to be a fairly navigable appropriations process with the COVID money that's there and with what I've just outlined on those top 5, 6 states for North Carolina, we like what we're seeing relative to infrastructure and we believe that's going to be, Garik. Thank you, Garik. Happy too. Courtney, thank you for the question. So I'm going to take the last part of your question first. And by the way, wholeheartedly agree with you. And that as I indicated early on, if we're looking at the Pacific business and we're looking at overall aggregate selling prices there, I think what we've indicated is they tend to be about $0.70 a ton lower than heritage Martin Marietta. We've said across the board, you should expect ASP increases of 5% to 8%. And what I'm indicating is we should expect California to outperform that. And frankly, if California is not seeing low double-digit price increases, I would be disappointed in that. So I think that's totally consistent with your thinking. And again, while January there's not a year make, we certainly like the numbers that we've seen in January. If we think about what EBITDA contribution is going to look like in that group, here's the way I would encourage you to think of it. We've indicated again, we're going to be an aggregates-led business there with around 13 million tons of stone. We will have a ready-mix business in Arizona, and we will have hot mix in California and Arizona. And if you think about EBITDA contribution, about 70% of the EBITDA contribution is going to be from aggregates in that business around 18% will be from ready-mix and around 13% will be from asphalt. So if you go back and look historically at what would have been cement business in California, together with a ready-mix business in California and simply take those out. And we put some pies together for you when we announced that transaction, showing how much was cement and aggregates and ready-mix and hot mix because at that point, we were talking about the upstream portion of it. And now what you're seeing in upstream at that time, by the way, Courtney, meant both aggregates and cement. Now we're talking about a business that with nearly 70% of the EBITDA being from aggregates is in the lexicon that we typically use an aggregates-led business, which is what we're looking to number one, have in that state. But Courtney, I think even more importantly, that's what we intend to keep building in that state. They are independent players there. There's a lot of potential M&A activity that's already underway in California. And so I'm trying to give you a snapshot of what it was, what it is right now. And what it is right now from an aggregate side perspective, we believe, will become even heavier. Since it was a carve-out, really the synergies that will come from that transaction will be what we bring to it operationally, which we're in the process of doing and what we're doing commercially. And I think the commercial efforts are already evident. Relative to broken out EBITDA, we've actually not given that. I think if you go back and look at some of the information that we gave at the time relative to the Lehigh Hanson transaction and Tiller because we spoke about those in connection with each other. I think you can probably back into some of that, but we certainly had some arrangements with buyers and sellers that we would not talk about some of those numbers with greater specificity. So I'm not intending to be clever with you, not at all. I apologize on that. But I think overall, you can back into likely where those are. But again, because you're not buying a public company, moving offices, et cetera, and it's a carve-out, the synergies end up being more commercial and operational excellence over time. There's going to be improvement. It will be in the back half of the year. I think a good example that we've been able to use in the past, Courtney, is we could probably see in the mid-single digits from a volume perspective, higher, for example, in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. almost on a daily basis than we're seeing right now simply because of the lack of trucks. So I think if we look at supply chains right now, primarily, it's one of logistics. It's how quickly can people bringing their trucks or how efficient can rail be in moving product. Overall, supply chain on labor for us is not a particular issue right now. Our supply chain itself is so domestically oriented. We haven't struggled with that. And equally, we're not struggling with putting adequate product on the ground. So we believe we can meet the demand. We believe we can do it in a very low cost way. We do think we're going to be in a position that we can assure that we're getting fair value for our products. But I do think the single largest challenge will continue to be transportation logistics. And we do believe there will likely be some degree of ease on that in the second half of the year. But I would tell you, we have not built that in. And the other thing that we have done, Courtney, and this is probably relative to say, in our pricing letters for this year, we have indicated to our customers that they should prepare for midyear price increases from us. At the same time, we have not factored that in to any of the guidance that we've given you. So do I think there's potentially some upside relative to logistic easing in half 2, I do. And when I tell you very candidly, we've told customers to, in many respects, you prepare for midyears, and that's not in our numbers, that would be grown. Thank you, Courtney. Good morning. Mike, thank you very much for the question. What I'm going to do is turn that over to Jim. I want him to walk you through what we're seeing relative to the labor M&R. And in particular, what we're seeing with respect to diesel. The short answer, at least from my perspective, goes back though to the prepared remarks and push said, we expect to see better margins in our upstream materials business this year than we did last year. So that's going to give you the punchline. But let me let Jim walk you through at least what we're seeing in some discrete areas of the business. Good morning Jerry. Fair enough, Jerry. So keep in mind, even on longer-term work, historically, at least over the last decade, we would have been building in price increases on longer-term work on an annual basis. So do we anticipate those price increases in the future of being greater than some of them have been in the past. The short answer is yes. If we're looking overall at backlog, customer backlog, and that's the important way to try to remember it, what we're looking at right now is the backlog in aggregates, that's about 14% ahead of where it was in prior year. And if I'm breaking it down even more granularly, what you'll find is in the East Group, it's up around 17% versus prior year and the West Group is up around 10% versus prior year. So I'm particularly heartened by that because as you'll recall, that East Group, which is a pure Stone business tends to have the highest margins in the company. and they also have the largest backlogs in the aggregates group. The other thing that I think is worth adding to it as well, Jerry, is as we're looking at what's going on in MAG Specialties, they've got record backlogs across their business as well. Obviously, the chemicals portion of that business is doing exceedingly well. It clearly had a few cost headwinds relative to natural gas and some degree of what was going to the steel business for a portion of Q4. And so it's always interesting to me when margins in that business are taking down a little bit to 38.5%. That tends to give people's attention, but it's a solid 40% margin business, and customer backlogs in that business are records. And again, in aggregates they are up nicely ahead of prior year. And again, we're talking about midyears on those as well. We do protect customers on the pricing that they've had in the past, but we do expect to get midyear this year, and we expect the midyear to be attracted. You bet, Jerry. this stuff: Good morning. What if you think back to it, Adam, that's exactly where we came out last February, too, right? And we said 1% to 4%. And obviously, we finished the year on the high end of that. If we're looking at overall total. And keep in mind, the 1% to 4% is on the organic. If we're looking overall, we're talking 7% to 10%. So what I would say is, I think back to the dialogue I was having a few moments ago, can we meet the demand? Yes. Can we meet the spec requirements? Yes. Can we do that almost anywhere we need in the United States? The short answer is yes. If you can give me a good snapshot of what's going to happen with transportation and logistics, I can probably tell you what's going to happen relative to volume. So if we're right that we're going to see some degree of easing logistically and have to Frankly, I think that certainly is trending you towards the higher end of that. But if we think about what the issues are that may make that slower, it's not going to be an issue of demand and it's not going to be an issue of our ability to meet the demand. It's going to be what's happening relative to third parties and their ability to move this down. You bet. Great. [indiscernible] hear your voice. Well, again, I'm going to kick that over to Jim. As part of what Jim told you in his prepared comments, basically looking at the business, as we're looking at it right now, we're going to be back to our 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio by the end of the year. So as you can tell, this is a business that de-levers very quickly. If you think about our overall capital priorities, the short answer is, Timna, they haven't changed over time. I'd ask Jim to walk you through those, but M&A continues to be one that's been coming to us. But Jim? Thank you, Timna. David, thanks for the question. Good morning to you. So a couple of things. One, if we think about the way the country has recovered over the last several years, the East really took a harder fall in the downturn than the Southwest and in some respects on the West. So we've seen markets like Atlanta recovering more vodantly right now as well as the Carolinas and up into Virginia. And now we're seeing a very attractive recovery in Maryland as well. So if I'm looking at east versus west broadly, I am thinking we're likely to see a more snap back in the East in many respects than we are in the heritage West. I think California is going to be an attractive market for us. But again, I'm comforted by the fact that we're seeing good activity in the East. With respect to your cement question, look, you're internally right, I mean we're tapped out in many respects at about 4 million tons right now. Obviously, we're adding capacity to what we're doing in Texas with the FM 7 capital project that Jim spoke to before. I guess several things. One, our efficiencies were not necessarily helped last year by that decrease that occurred last February. So David, as you may recall, I know you're accustomed to it in Cleveland, but in Dallas and San Antonio, they're not accustomed to the type of weather that they had last year. That was there for an extended period of time that really not only slowed down sales, slowdown production and actually caused an oversized degree of M&R. We don't think that's going to recur. So we do believe there are going to be efficiencies that simply come from that. If we're looking overall at what we think is going to happen relative to pricing, Again, we saw multiple price increases last year in cement. Right now, we're looking at a $12 a ton increase in April. I think the other thing that can be a bit of a swing factor there, David, is where is some of that going to be as well. Obviously, DFW is a very healthy market, so is Central Texas. But part of what we saw in the quarter was more material heading to West Texas. Now granted, percentages in this concept sounds really big tonnages are huge. So if we're looking at quarter percentages changes, we saw 215% more material head to West Texas. Now what does that mean? Is there a practical matter? 37,000 tons went to West Texas in the quarter versus 12,000 tons in the previous quarter. But as we look at average selling price on those, that's at an average selling price of around $203 a ton versus a total cement all-in number of $127. So I would say several things. Do we anticipate a better year operation in Texas than we had last year? Absent another deep freeze, the answer is yes. Do we anticipate a better pricing environment across the state? The answer is yes. And do we anticipate seeing more material, not massive amounts, but more going into West Texas year-over-year? The answer to that is yes as well, David. So I hope that helps. Hi, Zane. That's a great question, Zane. And the good news is, look, we've had a highly enthusiastic team there that's delighted to be part of Martin Marietta. One of the things that I outlined early on is we achieved world-class safety metrics on both lost time and total case despite the fact that we had really one of the largest years of M&A in our company's history. The reason that I start out with that is that, to us, is so cultural and so important. And when we have colleagues who appreciate the importance of that to us, that's a really good starting point. I think something that we have clearly brought to that though, and I think it goes back to the portfolio optimization efforts. We are, first and foremost, in aggregates business. So what I would tell you is we're assuring that our new colleagues in California understand that, that is for us the alpha and the mega of what this business is in so many respects. And being superb operationally is going to be important and vital and absolutely who we are. Now from a timing perspective, saying, as you would imagine, getting operational improvements isn't as immediate at times as you can get commercial improvements. So what are we happy with? We're very happy to see that the training that we put in place, the timing that we put in place and otherwise relative to commercial activity has worked really well. Do we have work ahead of us relative to bringing these sites up to Martin Marietta operational levels? We do. And actually, that's what I see is the good news part of it because we think there's nice things that can be done with this business, not over the near-term, but near, medium and long. The other piece, and it's not so much a challenge, but it's realistic is we need to make sure that the people who are in that state in business in that state know who we are because relationships are important, and we want to grow our business in that state. And we want to grow our business, first and foremost, in the aggregates line of it. So again, no big surprises there. I think very much what we thought and importantly, the areas that we thought we could make some refinements that can make a difference have been happening so far. So I've been saying thank you for that question, and I hope that response is helpful. You bet. Well, it looks like that's the end of the questions for today. So thank you all for joining today's earnings call. Underpinned by our disciplined execution of our proven strategy and our long-standing capital allocation priorities, we're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving sustainable growth and superior shareholder value as we saw it to a sustainable future. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2022 results in just a few months. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and stay well."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we are evaluating our strategic alternatives as it relates to the California cement plants, related distribution terminals and California ready-mix operations. These assets, along with several parcels of land have been classified as assets held-for-sale on the balance sheet. And the profits they generate are shown as earnings from discontinued operations on the income statement. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are not included in either 2021 reported earnings from continuing operations or our forward earnings guidance. For our continuing operations, both the building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our record revenues and profitability, notwithstanding energy headwinds of almost $75 million which is nearly one-third higher compared with 2020 on an organic basis. Our aggregates pipeline established records for revenues and gross profit. Product gross margin of 29.6% included higher diesel costs and a $25 billion negative impact from selling acquired inventory. There was marked-up the fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 30.4% a 20 basis point decline versus the prior year. Gross profit per ton shift improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. Improve cement profitability in the second half of the year was not enough to overcome production inefficiencies and incremental storm related costs from February deep freeze in Texas. As a result, cement product gross margin declined 600 basis points to 31.8% despite top line growth. Increased raw material, energy and maintenance costs also pressured margins. Ready-mix concrete product gross margin was 8.3% relatively flat compared with prior year as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Adjusted products and services gross margin for asphalt and paving business decreased 180 basis points to 16.4% from higher raw materials cost and operational disruptions from a summertime Colorado liquid asphalt shortage. Magnesia Specialties achieved record revenues and profitability. Product revenues of $275 million increased 24% driven largely by demand for magnesia-based chemicals products used for cobalt extraction. Cobalt prices, which has doubled since the fourth quarter of 2020 are expected to remain at high levels and should support demand for chemicals products throughout 2022. Product gross profit increased 23% to $110 million even though higher costs for energy and contract services resulted in a 40 basis point decline in product gross margin to 40.2%. Martin Marietta ended 2021 with a strongest cash generation in our history, operating cash flow of $1.14 billion increased 8% driven by improvement in net working capital efficiency. SOAR continues to provide the framework to responsibly and sustainably grow our business and deploy capital for long-term success. The company's long standing capital allocation priorities balance our value enhancing acquisitions with proven capital expenditures, and our goal of consistently returning capital to shareholders while preserving financial flexibility and an investment grade credit rating profile. In addition to the $3.1 billion to deploy for attractive platform and bolt-on acquisitions in 2021, we also invested $423 million of capital into our business. In November, we completed a capacity expansion project at our Bridgeport quarry adding over 3.5 million tons of aggregates annual production capacity and reducing our customers loading those cycle times. This project increases throughput at our flagship quarry in the fast growing Dallas/Fort Worth market. We will continue to prioritize high return capital projects to drive large expansion in 2022. We also returned $148 million to shareholders, reflecting our most recent dividend increase announced in August. Since a repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases, while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased 3.2 times as of December 31 reflecting the debt financed acquisition of Lehigh Hanson West in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our past practice of reducing leverage following an acquisition, we expect debt ratio to be 2.5 times by year-end 2022. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2022 outlook. Yes, yes. It's Jim. Good morning. The answer is it's mostly organic business. It's not Lehigh Hanson assets predominantly. The main project in 2022 is what we've outlined before is the large capacity expansion to melon. We refer to it as a -- that is the large projects that we've got going on next -- this year in 2022. So that's the main one. We expect to have a very high return on that one, especially given the pricing outlook that we're seeing for cement in that market. So that's going to be I think, a very high returning project for us. Otherwise, as I think about it in total, for modeling purposes, I think 9% of sales roughly is generally how I think about this business over time, and we're not too far off that, I think, in 2022. Yes. Sure. So the labor services component is probably around 5%. The other elements, which are smaller, slice of the cost pie supplies, 5% to 10%; repairs and maintenance, probably 5% to 10% as well. But obviously, the main component of what we sell is our stone, that is -- we own that. There's no -- and we source that from the ground. So that's going to help with the inflationary environment as well. So those costs are going up, but it's a smaller portion of our total cogs pie than other areas. And so on the aggregate piece, we're going to be growing margins, as Ward said overall. But again, those are the rough ways of thinking about it. Diesel in particular is the one, it was a headwind this year for 2021. We expect it to be a headwind in 2022. We've built in around $25 million of additional diesel costs in 2022. We're hoping that's not enough. It looks like it is right now, but we'll modify that if we need to. Sure. So Michael, we don't give out quarterly guidance. So I'm going to stick with sort of somatic ways of thinking about it. Back-end loaded, profit-wise, that is true, more than historically we've seen for two reasons, really. One, our price increases are larger this year than they were last year, and those are largely effective ever one. So first quarter this year still hasn't really got the ticker from the accelerating price increases. So that effect is slightly delayed. Two, the diesel headwinds that you mentioned, those are more pronounced in the first half of the year than they will be in the second half of the year. So those are the two main reasons we're seeing gross profits will be back-end weighted versus historical patterns. Yes. So we wouldn't pass on an acquisition today if it came through based on our leverage. We have the ability to go after that opportunity and still deleverage. So that's not a roadblock for us at this point. And as we've mentioned, we do expect to get to 2.5 times by year-end on a net basis. And even with that in mind, we will take a balanced approach to our capital -- so whether we buy back shares, that's on off the table this year, either even with those things, M&A and share buyback, et cetera, increasing dividend, hopefully in August. That is all in the cards, even with our leverage where it's at. That's all contemplated with our stated forecasted end of year net leverage of 2.5 times. So hopefully that answers your question."

A question-and-answer session will follow the Company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg : Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've made available during this webcast and on the investors section of our website, Q3 2021 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends.  In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by U.S. Securities Law in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance.  Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings which are available on both our own and the SEC website. Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our third quarter operating performance and our recently completed acquisition of Lehigh Hanson's West Region. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results after which Ward will discuss market trends as we look ahead to 2022. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye : Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta has continued growth and record results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan. And with fewer reportable and lost time incidents than this time last year, our Company-wide safety incident rates are surpassing world-class levels.  I'm proud to report that we are on track to deliver the most profitable and safest year in our Company's history. We're also excited about the progress we're making on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further position our Company for sustainable long-term operational and financial success. On October 1st, we welcome more than 1200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team as we successfully completed the acquisition of Lehigh Hanson's West Region business. With this outstanding team, strong business in key assets now a part of our offering, we're well-positioned to benefit from favorable market dynamics and accelerating public and private construction activity in important California and Arizona regions, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix.  It also provides new growth platforms for our continued geographic expansion. I'm grateful to our colleagues for the dedication and perseverance in their efforts to complete the acquisition, the second largest in our Company's history. We look forward to working together to seamlessly integrate the Lehigh West Operations, quickly realize synergies, and deliver significant stakeholder value. Integration activities are progressing as planned from both an operational and customer-facing perspective. As highlighted in today's release, we once again established record results for revenues and gross profit for both the quarter and year-to-date. To recap for the first 9 months of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to a record $1.1 billion. Both our building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses continue to capitalize on the ongoing economic recovery.  During the quarter, organic shipment and pricing growth combined with value-enhancing acquisitions, more than offset higher-than-expected energy-related costs and contributed to our record setting results. Specifically, on a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 18% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% to $450 million, adjusted EBITDA of $490 million increased 13% on a comparable basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.25 grew 11% on a comparable basis.  As a reminder, the prior year quarter included $70 million or $0.87 per diluted share up non-recurring gains on surplus plan sales, and divested assets that affect quarter-over-quarter comparability. Now, for a review of our third quarter operating performance. We continue to experience growing product demand across our 3 primary end-use markets. Organic aggregate shipments increased 6% notwithstanding contractor capacity constraints and wet weather in several markets that govern the overall pace of construction activity. Notably, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the strong underlying demand trends across our geographic footprint. Total aggregate shipments, including shipments from acquired operations increased 10%. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 2%, reflecting a higher percentage of lower-priced based on shipments during the quarter. Additionally, our East Division, which has selling prices in excess of our corporate average, had the opportunity to meet customer needs with a low -priced excess fill product that had we not shipped, we otherwise would have incurred costs to relocate.  We expect shipments of this excess fill material, which are profitable and not a substitute for higher-value products to continue through the remainder of the year. That's why we updated our full-year 2021 organic pricing growth guidance to now range from 2.5% to 3.5%. To be clear, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive. In fact, supported by strong underlying demand and rapid cost inflation in the broader economy, we successfully implemented midyear price increases in the Carolinas and Texas.  These actions, combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility, bode well for meaningful pricing acceleration in 2022. Our Texas cement business established a new quarterly record for shipments, which increased 4% to over 1 million tons. Large and diversified projects, recovering energy sector activity, and incremental pull-through from our internal downstream customers, supported record monthly shipment levels in both August and September. Cement pricing increased 8% as the second round of price increases this year went into effect on September 1st.  Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments increased 23% driven by the large non-residential projects and operations acquired late last year in Texas. Concrete pricing grew 2% following the implementation of midyear price increases in Texas. Additionally, we've announced a third price increase in the Dallas, Fort Worth market effect October 1. Asphalt shipments increased 116% overall, driven by contributions from our Minnesota -based operations acquired earlier this year.  Our Colorado asphalt and paving business experienced shipment declines and supply disruptions from midsummer liquid asphalt allocations throughout the Rocky Mountains. That circumstances now been resolved. Despite these short-term issues, market fundamentals remain strong across the Colorado Front Range. Organic asphalt pricing improved modestly. Before discussing our preliminary 2022 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim.\nJim Nickolas : Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. Both the building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our double-digit growth in product revenues and increased profitability. That said, increase energy expense continues as a headwind, temporarily pressuring margins. For the third quarter alone, total energy costs increased $28 million or nearly 50% Company-wide, as compared with last year. Absent this headwind, our consolidate adjusted gross margin would have outpaced the record set in the prior-year quarter.  Aggregate\u2019s product gross margin of 34.2% included higher diesel and other production costs, as well as a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.9%, a 150-basis point decline versus prior year. Cement product gross margin declined 250 basis points driven by higher raw material cost and a $6 million increase in natural gas and electricity cost.  Ready-mix concrete product gross margin improved modestly to nearly 10% as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $72 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher costs for energy and contract services, driving a 100-basis points improvement in product gross margin to 39%.  As part of our longstanding capital allocation priorities, we continue to balance value enhancing acquisitions with prudent capital spending, and returning cash to shareholders while preserving a healthy Balance Sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. Consistent with SOAR 2025, we acquired a crushed concrete aggregates producer in the Houston area in late July. These acquired aggregates operations expand our customer base and product offerings and one of the nation's largest addressable markets. We have raised our full-year capital spending guidance to $475 million to $525 million to include anticipated Lehigh West Region 's capital expenditures.  We continue to prioritize high return capital projects, focus on growing sales, and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its confidence in our future performance, and a resilient, and growing free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.44. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividend, as well as share repurchases.  In early July, we issued $2.5 billion of Senior Notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.2% and a weighted-average tenure of 15 years, primarily to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times as of September 30. Leverage on a pro form basis, inclusive of recent acquisitions, is modestly above 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times within the next 18 months.  As detailed in today's release, we've updated our full-year 2021 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results that factor in higher energy costs and the fourth-quarter contribution from the newly acquired Lehigh West Business. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1 billion, $500 million to $1 billion, $550 million dollars. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.\nWard Nye : Thanks, Jim. Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well-positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint. Expanded federal and state level infrastructure investment, single-family housing strength, heavy industrial projects of scale, and light non-residential recovery should support growing construction activity and contribute to attractive pricing acceleration for heavy-side building materials for years to come. Importantly, we have both the ability and the capacity to supply these needed products, and supported by our locally led pricing strategy, we'll do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. While navigating an imperfect legislative process, our nation is nonetheless on the cusp of achieving the most significant infrastructure action of this century. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains a 5-year surface transportation reauthorization and provides $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, and other hard infrastructure projects passed the U.S. Senate in August, with 69 bi partisan votes. Though the U.S. House of Representatives could not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week before the then current short-term extension of the federal highway and public transportation programs expired on October 31st, the house and senate did approve a short-term program extension, keeping surface transportation funds flowing to the States through December 3rd.  The consensus opinion with which we strongly agree is that this important legislation will be signed into law before year-end. Aside from the overall economic growth we expect to occur with the increased federal transportation investment, the steps we've taken over the past decade to responsibly grow and expand our footprint will also benefit Martin Marietta 's near and long-term outlook. Project lettings for our Company's top 5 States Department of Transportation or DOTs, continue to positively trend. Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 building materials revenues are well-positioned from both the DOT funding and resource perspective to efficiently deploy increased federal and state transportation dollars and advanced the growing number of projects and their backlogs. Notably, California, the nation's most popular state and the world's fifth largest economy, becomes a top state for Martin Marietta following the Lehigh West acquisition.  Caltrans, California's Department of Transportation, manages a $17 billion annual budget. Additionally, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, commonly referred to as Senate Bill 1 or SB1 provides $54 billion or approximately $5 billion annually through 2030 to fund state and local road, freeway, and rail projects. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of third quarter organic shipments, showing sequential growth since this year's second quarter, but still well below our 10-year historical average of 43%.  Non-residential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data-centers. We've also seen early signs of recovery in light commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Atlanta, Denver, and the Texas Triangle. Light non-residential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given that it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregate shipment to the non -residential accounted for 35% of third quarter organic shipments.  Across our cost-to-cost footprint, single family residential [Indiscernible] are expected to remain robust despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times. Significant under-building in commensurate with notable population gains over the past decade and accelerated deorganisation support these trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2-3 times more aggregates-intensive than multi-family construction, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities.  Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter organic shipments. In summary, we believe our industry is about to see public and private sector construction activity coalesce for the first time since its most recent 2005 peak, supporting both increased shipments and an attractive pricing environment for construction materials. For 2022, our preliminary view anticipates organic aggregates shipments will increase in the low-to-mid single-digits, As contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continued to impact on otherwise robust demand environment.  Underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in 2022 organic aggregates pricing. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our record setting safety, operational, and financial performance, and look forward to continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter and 2022. As a result of our thoughtfully developed and consistently executed strategic priorities, our Company's future is bright.  With our steadfast commitment to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices in store execution, Martin Marietta intends to build the safest, best performing and most durable aggregates lead public Company poised to deliver attractive growth and superior value for all of our stakeholders. If the Operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question. Please stand-by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.\nTrey Grooms : Hey, good morning, everyone. Nice work in the quarter, especially given some of these headwinds that are out there.\nWard Nye : Thank you, Trey.\nTrey Grooms : So, Ward, your initial outlook for '22 around aggregates pricing, looking for mid to high single digits, clearly an acceleration from what we've seen this year and in recent years. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that expectation, your comfort level there? And maybe bridging that from this year. Is it more reliant on more midyear increases or is this primarily a spring increase that's driving this and then as part of that, the pricing discussions -- summit price announcements that we've been hearing about for next spring are pretty healthy. So maybe if you could speak to what's your thinking on that front as well as we go into next year.\nWard Nye : Happy to. Trey, thank you for your question. I think several things are worth noting. One, we saw a nice series of midyear price increases this year, and we saw that in two markets that matter a lot for us. We saw that in Texas and we saw that in the Carolinas. So that immediately starts setting the framework for next year. Keep in mind as I outlined in the prepared remarks, part of what we've seen this year as an optimal headwind is frankly a higher degree of base sales that we've seen particularly in the East, as well as some [Indiscernible] sales that have gone out of the East.  What I think is important to keep in mind Trey is the pricing range that you see is really a heritage driven range. In other words, we're not taking into account what we believe is going to happen in California and that, we're not taking into account what we believe can happen in Minnesota and that. As reminder, those markets historically have been below corporate average. So, if I reflect on where we're positioning toward next year on the conversations that we have had with our customers to-date and what we believe the overall economic environment is likely to be, we have a very high level of confidence in the ASPS that we're talking about for next year.  You had also asked specifically about cement, which is the -- a perfectly fair question. As we look at cement, several things that are worth noting as we think about the year that's wrapping up as well as the year that we're going into. Keep in mind, several things have happened this year. 1. Our price increase in cement in Texas in April was $9 a ton. We came back in September and the second price increase, that was at $8 a ton. That's the first time we've seen a mid-year of that sort since 2014.  Again, I think underscoring nice overall pricing momentum. If we're looking at what we're anticipating next year, we're anticipating a price increase in cement up $12 a ton. As a practical matter we're looking at that effective January 1 in California, we're looking at that relative to April 1 in Texas. So, a little bit of a different date between those 2 states, but still a very common number on focusing. We also believe in total candor(ph) that if some of the governing aspects around the volume would go away, volume could actually be better.  It's interesting is when looking at volume today and I'd mentioned this trait because I think this also has an effect on pricing from an emotional perspective as well as others. But, what our team in Texas would tell us today is if there was more trucking available, say for example in the Dallas, Fort Worth market, We could be selling on a daily basis, 3% to 5% more tonnage than we're selling today. So, I think all of those factors call us to underscore what we believe 2022 is lining up to be a very attractive pricing environment for the Company.\nTrey Grooms : Thanks, Ward, that's all very encouraging and thanks for the color and thanks for taking my questions. Good luck.\nWard Nye : You bet you. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is open.\nBryan Barros : Thank you, morning. This is actually Bryan Barros on for Kathryn and thank you for taking my question. To the extent you can -- can you expand on what you're hearing on how your customers are thinking about next year, the makeup of their backlogs across projects or end markets? And you touched on it just now on the last question, but how would the current bottlenecks around labor and trucking are playing into that outlook in your initial thoughts on the 2020 volume guidance. Thank you.\nWard Nye : No, thank you, Brian. I'll start with the latter part first, and that is what we've done in looking at volume next year is assuming that we're going to continue to see same governors around volume that we have this year. So again, I think we've taken a very responsible view at volume next year, and potentially, if you see some of these labor, transportation, and other backlogs or issues resolve themselves. It could be better next year. If we're thinking about overall customer backlog and the way that they're thinking about their business, here is the way that I would at least encourage you to think about that. As we are looking over all across the aggregates business, we're seeing it about 15% ahead of prior year levels based on what our customers are telling us. And there is a nice break. If we're looking in the East Group, again, that's up almost 14% based on what customers are saying to us. If we're looking in the West group, that's up around 18% based on customers are telling them. What I think is important as well, we came into the year with very attractive cement backlog. Cement, year-over-year is modestly down but I think what's important is we have some very notable projects that are in the pipeline right now that we think actually adds to that pretty considerably. And importantly, as we look at our Magnesia Specialties business, we're looking at record customer backlogs and we see very robust line business going into 2022 and we see some chemicals tailwinds going into the new year as well. So, it's consistent with the comments that you heard that I shared in my prepared remarks. This is 1 of those instances where we feel like we're seeing public and private come together in a very attractive, very powerful way. And part of what I think is telling about this one is we believe it has the capacity, particularly if we got the new highway bill to be in place, not just for a matter of quarters, progress for a matter of years. So, Bryan, I hope that helps.\nBryan Barros : I do. Thank you.\nWard Nye : You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich : Yes, Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nWard Nye : Good morning, Jer.\nJerry Revich : If you could comment -- Hi, I'm wondering if you could comment for aggregates on the cadence of pricing that you expect to play out over the next couple of quarters as you lay out the pricing expectations for '22. Now does that assume that the exit rate on a year-over-year basis is higher than that entrant\u2019s rate. Can you maybe just talk about that if you don't mind?\nWard Nye : I'm not sure that I can give you something on that that's going to be precise and give you good direction on it, because I think so much of that's going to be driven. It can be particularly in fourth-quarter by seasonality and what's happening in some parts of the country as opposed to others. What I will tell you is the conversations we've had with customers, or conversations that we've already had. The correspondents that we were going to have with customers to basically affirm for our pricing for next year has already gone out. Really, Jerry, I think if there's risk to pricing next year.  Frankly, it's more on the upside as opposed to the downside because the numbers that we gave you in the release and that I referenced in my prepared remarks are heritage numbers only. And, obviously, part of what contractors are seeing today, and I'm sure they're seeing across a whole host of inputs, is an inflationary environment unlike anything that they've seen for a while. The other thing to keep in mind is if you go back and look at whether it's CPI, PPI or otherwise over a long period of time and by that, I don't meet a year or 2, I mean decades. What you'll find is aggregate pricing has consistently outperformed that metric and this year actually was behind it just a bit. So, I expect to see that gap made up next year, Jerry. So that's how I would think about that.\nJerry Revich : And Ward, in terms of the timing of the increases, a lot of times in year markets, your time increases for March and April instead of January 1 for aggregates. Is the thinking any different this year, given the extraordinary weather, or excuse me, inflation. Are you folks -- the increase that have gone out were they for January 1, which would be I think sooner than normal.\nWard Nye : But you're right. It does vary and there will be some markets that go January 1, there will be some that will go April 1. As a practical matter, Jerry. because there's not that much heavy-side activity that occurs in January and February. Keep in mind, we've launched that, for example, that the last 2 weeks of March can make or break the first quarter. So, whether they go into effect in January or whether they go into effect in April, typically for us isn't that moving.  We're trying to make sure that we maintain your relationships with customers that are so important and don't put them in a position that they find themselves in anyway dislocated, so we've tried to remain relatively consistent from a timing perspective. But again, we don't feel like the timing from January to April, given the seasonality effect of those period of months, is going to be at moment.\nJerry Revich : And lastly, I'm wondering, can you talk about the acquisitions in terms of the performance? So far, anything interesting that's come to light since you won assets and I know that California asset you haven't known all that long but maybe you could tell us how it's going so far versus your initial expectations?\nWard Nye : Thank you for the question, Jerry. I would say that the integration is actually going quite well in all of them. We've got a single process that we're utilizing for this integration, so 1 team continues to look at it. The nice thing about this is the integration are occurring, obviously in the West, in the Central and of the Southwest. So, no particular team is overwhelmed with what's going on. Operationally, we're very pleased with the way that it's going.  The teams that have become part of Martin Marietta team to this process, have proven to be every bit as good as we thought that they would. I continue to be moved by what I feel we can do relative to bring commercial excellence to these operations. And I think particularly in California, that's likely to be the upside that we're going to see there. But again, if you think about what's happened this year, it's going over $3 billion worth of deals.  So, if we go back and look at Tiller, which came in at the end of April, SCC that can in at the end of July and again, Lehigh Hanson's came in at the beginning of October. By any stretch that's a big M&A year for Martin Marietta. And we're very pleased with the people and we're very pleased with the operations and very pleased with the site. So, I appreciate the question. I'm happy to tell you there have been no negative surprises.\nJerry Revich : All right. Terrific. Thanks.\nWard Nye : You bet. Take care Jerry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies, your line is open.\nPhil Ng : Hey guys. How should we think about the annual sales and EBITDA contribution from some of your recent acquisitions, particularly high, given the size of it for 2022? And then Ward, I think your comments for aggregate pricing was -- for next year is largely on your legalese -- legacy side. Is there reluctance to give a little more color on that front just simply because the deal just closed and you haven't had any real firm conversations with your customers or It could take a little time to begin -- to get that pricing more in line with the broader Company?\nWard Nye : Phil, thank you for the question. I think several things. 1. We're going to give you a good sense of where we believe those businesses will be when we come out in February next year. Part of what you'll see if you go to the supplemental information with today's release is you'll get a good snapshot, particularly relative to The Lehigh West on what the tonnages look like in aggregate cement ready-mix and asphalt. So that will give you a nice way to back into some of that. You will also see a nice '21 -- 2021 budget EBITDA contribution. So again, I think that can put you there.  With respect to the overall pricing as you would imagine, we've got a nice blend of new products in Martin Marietta, but importantly, Heritage Martin Marietta\u2019s players, particularly in California, that are working together in that marketplace. I can tell you that our correspondents on pricing went out to our customers last week. These are live conversations -- by the way, they've all been very good conversations, as I indicated in one of the earlier questions, if I had to speculate today, my guess would be on a percentage basis. We will likely see ASPS on a percentage basis on the newly acquired operations on percentages that will be higher than here in Martin Marietta. So again, I don't see a downside right there, I see potential upside opportunity in those markets. And again, to your point, we can probably, if I really wanted to dig deep, be a little bit more specific with you on Lehigh Hanson's the same time on mindful that we've owned that business were about 32 days. And our sense is, let's have it for a little bit longer than 32 days before we get into too much detail on that. But hopefully, the direction I've given you and the supplemental information relative to tonnage EBITDA contributions, where we are relative to the organic business on ASPS, in my view that the acquired operations will likely over-achieve that, gives you a sense of how we look at that.\nPhil Ng : And then just one follow-up on the pricing, Ward. Pricing came in a little lighter this year and then a part of that is just mix from the [Indiscernible] business and the guidance you gave, if you had a level set that, is that mid-to-high single-digit still a good way to think about it, just given how it's a little lower this year?\nWard Nye : No. As I said, I certainly don't see downside to aggregate price in next year. And if we're looking at the film material that's gone out this year in the East in particular year to date, Phil, this will give you a sense of it. It's been about 900,000 tonnes. And part of what's happened here over the last -- during the last quarter as well is we started shipping some stone on a large NCDOT project that's here and the Raleigh that was bid about 2 years ago.  So again, those are just some of the more optical issues. Something that I think is worth always keeping in mind, Phil, is, when [Indiscernible] is going in a year like this, what you know is going to happen, is the clean stones want to come either, because at some point you're going to put either asphalt or concrete on top of the clean stones. And we actually see those clean stone pricings -- prices moving in a very attractive way.\nPhil Ng : Super. Thanks a lot, Ward.\nWard Nye : Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.\nStanley Elliott : Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. I'll switch gears here a bit and ask about the Magnesia Specialties. Is that a business that you guys are capped in terms of your output or your tonnage? Just curious how you're thinking about that. Is there a chance to expand it given how rich the margins are and the outlook for commodity prices being so good to those in-markets?\nWard Nye : Great question, Stan and thank you for asking that. That's a business that performs quarter-after-quarter extraordinarily well and never gets depressed that team deserves. Look, you saw what I did, too and that was record revenues through up 30% over the prior-year quarter. I mean, several things were happening when it's a strong metal mining activity around world. We're seeing good activity in steel. To your point, in many respects, we are kept -- we're running at capacity on volumes than in that marketplace right now. Pricing was up nearly 4%. We think pricing may have some nice upside to it.  One thing that's worth noticing though, is if we look at where domestic steel is now, steel is running at about 80% -- almost 85%. That's up from Q2 last year when it found the bottom. It's up almost 51% since then. The other thing that I think is really impressive in that business when you look at the margins at 39%, and you take into account that natural gas pricing for Q3 was up 26%. And if we look at really what natural gas pricing has looked at for a longer period of time than that. If we go back to January 1 this year, I want to say in January, net gas pricing was at [Indiscernible], it's up almost $2.44 since then, almost a 146%. So, I guess what I would say is what we'd like to grow that business in particular? Point to your question, the short answer is we would. We've looked at ways to grow that business in the past, we will continue to do that. Are we largely at capacity at Woodville and Manistee today large that we are? Do we have the ability, on occasion, and will we continue to look at refining our products out of those 2 different facilities to make sure we're doing more high margin products? The short answer there is yes, we will.  So, the focus will be on continuing to control costs, which they do extraordinarily well. Being a price leader, which is something they've been focused on, continuing to look for ways to add to that business. We'd liked to do it but, in the meantime, making sure that we continue to refine the products that we're putting out. So, I would suggest you, Stanley, it's probably a 4- or 5-fold approach to that business.\nStanley Elliott : Perfect. Thanks so much and best of luck\nWard Nye : Thank you so much, Stanley\nOperator: Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. If we could just talk a little bit about the cement business and the updated guidance, I think you increased revenues, but really no additional profit there. Is that all higher energy costs or was -- it's some dilutive impact of acquisition? If you can just help us understand the guidance for the fourth quarter there and how to frame it for thinking about 2022.\nWard Nye : Courtney, [Indiscernible]. Thank you for the question. What -- Jim and I will bifurcate this. I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing going on in the market. I want Jim to come back and talk specifically about some of the issues that we had in maintenance this quarter and part of what we've seen in inventories. But here's what I would say overall, if we look at the volume, the volume is not too very attractive, so it's a 4% overall increase. We've had some July rain that slowed things down in Central and South Texas.  So, if we're looking at what was happening coming out of [Indiscernible], that was down about 3%. Now, the flip side is we saw very nice volumes coming out of North Texas at Midlothian, up about 6.7%. We also saw, in a percentage basis, very nice percentages up in West Texas. Now, what I'll tell you is, percentages on West Texas and volumes on West Texas tell two different stories. Because you can have a very big percentage, because the volumes have been overall quite low.  But what I'm happy to see is at least on a year-to-date basis, is West Texas volumes were up almost 66% as we continue to see mining do better. If we look in North Texas again, all by itself in September, that was up 25%. So, we saw a record volume quarter coming out of cement. Now we did have some maintenance issues that I want Jim to speak to, and I'll preface it with we're done with maintenance for the year on the big -- taking the kilns down. And then we had some inventory issues that he can walk you through that, I think, will give you some great color so, Jim over to you, please.\nJim Nickolas : Yeah. Sure. So, Courtney, so what we're really talking about is our old guidance to our updated guidance, right? So, what had happened there was we had a more downtime than we had planned on due some maintenance. So, there's $3 million more of higher maintenance. But the bigger effect for the year was the draw - down inventories. So, we had record shipments as you heard on our prepared remarks. The record shipments -- but our production levels were below what we had expected.  And so, when you have that situation, we have inventory draw - down into -- our fixed cost absorption was worse than we had forecast and that's the biggest piece of that headwinds for guidance. And then separately, of course, energy headwinds are elevated higher than we had forecasted previously, These are non-diesel headwinds so nat -gas, as Ward mentioned earlier, electricity, and to a much lesser extent, coal, All those costs were higher. Our view of it now is higher cost than our view of that 3 months ago. So, those were the real drivers of that. Did I answer your question, Courtney?\nCourtney Yakavonis : Yes. That was helpful. And I think you guys had also previously guided to what you thought energy costs would increase for the year. You obviously mentioned that you're expecting higher cost now, but can you just update us on what the guidance is baking in for a total increase -- for the fourth quarter or for the year?\nJim Nickolas : Yes. So, we're -- we -- last quarter, our view for diesel was right. So, we're spot on Q3, Q4 versus forecast diesel costs we -- we're still comfortable at the currently forecast levels. What we're surprised by was the non-diesel energy costs in Q3 and the forecasts now reflects that. So, I'd say it's up roughly depending on the fuel type, 35% to 60% year-over-year so that's what's now in our forecast. So that's in our new forecasts and we don't expect that to get worse at this point. Of course, we could be wrong and if we are wrong, the way to cure that is through midyear price increases down the road.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Okay. Great. And then just --\nWard Nye : Court, I have a quick comment.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Go ahead.\nWard Nye : Could give you a quick snapshot on that. So really for Jim is 15% of the impact was from diesel. If we look at energy across the entire business, and then a $28 million almost 2X bet if we look all in on energy, so I just want to make sure you had those 2 numbers.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Great. Thanks. And then just lastly, on the base material in excess fill that you sold this quarter, I believe you said you expect that to continue for the fourth quarter, are you baking in an assumption that that continues into 2022 or will that be fully cleared out by the end of the year?\nWard Nye : But it'll probably be largely cleared up by the end of the year. I think the fill will be gone. And again, I think a lot of it it's going to depend on how much space can contractors put down in effectively Q4, but yeah, that's going to be the only issue, Courtney. And as I indicated before that the nice thing is you know what's going to go on top of the base at some point.\nCourtney Yakavonis : Good. Thank you.\nWard Nye : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman : Hey. Great. Thank you. Good morning. Hey Ward, I just want to take a step back and thinking about your top 5 market, some of these labor constraints in supply deficiencies. Can you talk about which of those markets you've seen these issues most challenging and there are any markets in there that have been relatively insulated from that?\nWard Nye : I think the good news is, Brent, where if we look at our top markets which are going to be Texas, Colorado, now California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. They're all going to be pretty solid underlying economic markets and with most of those states having very high population inflows coming to them. And from our perspective, it's not so much an issue of supply. We're in a position to supply the materials, I think to your point, it's going to be more matter of labor.  And frankly, it's going to be a contractor timing perspective on when they're going to hire labor. One of the things that I'm at least defining on, Brent, is I think that's going to be one of the great collateral benefits from the highway bill on its best. Because when contractors have a sense that there are backlogs and their backlogs for a period of years are going to look very good. They're likely to hire, I think that's particularly true when we're looking at public works because public works, as you know, tend to come with liquidated damages if they're not finished in a timely manner.  But I think it's a practical matter that's going to be driving some of that. But again, if we look overall at the way our top states are positioned, they're positioned really well. If we're looking at TxDOT, their FY2022 lettings are set to exceed $10 billion. If we're looking at Colorado, they're looking at the DOT forecast that's up $850 million. NCDOT has returned to historical averages which puts them in a $5 billion a year budget. Georgia infrastructure look strong with additional $225 million of infrastructure investment. Florida is near record levels with very attractive backlogs.  But here's some of the things that are moved by -- you heard me mention Caltrans there budget, SB1 in the prepared remarks. But I didn't speak to our issues like SB9 and SBI0 in California that's allowing property owners to split single-family lots into 2 lots and streamlining of zoning or rezoning process. Because what we think that does in that market is it brings housing back in ways that that state hasn't seen for a while.  And as you recall [Indiscernible], from our analyst and Investor Day, so much goodness in heavy-side space tends to follow what's happening with single-family with a lag. If we see the highway bill, if we see the hiring that I think comes behind the highway bill, if we see the public work that I think we're going to see, and we continue to see that type of private work That's driven by revs. I think a lot of these supply chain and employee labor issues worked their way out. I don't think it's going to be immediate. And again, I think that's part of the government we've put on next year, but that's a long answer, but you asked a really good question and I think it has a lot of moving parts.\nBrent Thielman : I appreciate that, the comment. Thanks Ward.\nWard Nye : Thank you, Brent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane BNP. Your line is open.\nPaul Roger : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just changing -- actually a bit, maybe onto the sustainability agenda. There's a lot of talk around the minute about the circular economy and in particular using things like demolition waste instead of virgin aggregates. I guess it's a long-term question, but what impact do you think that could have on your volumes looking forward?\nWard Nye : No, Paul, thank you for your question very much. And Paul, I think that is something that we are cognizant enough that we're sensitive to I think in the fullness of time, recycle will play a bigger role than it's going to play in the next 5 or 10 years. And what do I mean by that? That I think we are going to go have to be looking to utilize recycled concrete more as a base product. I think we're going to be looking at higher degrees of recycled asphalt or RAP that used an asphalt mixes. Today, in many respects, you might see RAP in the, let's call it 20% portions of asphalt. I think you could see that going up into the 30% in the fullness of time. The primary driver of that being liquid, 1 reason I mentioned those 2 things in particular, Paul is if you look at the transactions at least 2 of the 3 that we've done this year, it's somewhat mindful of that.  If we're looking at the SCC Materials transaction that we did in July, That's basically buying a recycled business on concrete and selling that recycled concrete as an aggregate, and selling that in Houston, Texas where we have a significant presence and keep in mind part of what Tiller does for us in that marketplace -- I'm sorry, SCC is it adds a series of new yards for us. More specifically, it adds around 10 and we had a very attractive position in that marketplace with the existing rail yards that we had. So, to your point, it expands our footprint, but importantly, it adds new product offerings. Now similarly, if we look at the business that we've had in Minnesota at Tiller at the end of April, that's a stone business and it's a hot mix business, but it's not lay down business. So again, part of what that's going to allow us to do is to make sure that we're looking at percentages of [Indiscernible], how we're going to utilize that going forward. And the other piece of Tiller that I think has been important for us, is this part of that business we also picked up about a 100,000 tons worth of tank farm capacity in that marketplace, so we also have the ability to look at energy going forward in some modestly different ways with a fiscal hedge, because it allows us to hedge physically about 60% of our need for liquid in that relevant geographic market during the course of any one year. So, do we think we will see more recycle? Yes. Are we ourselves -- positioning ourselves to more of that? Yes. Do I think spec aggregates in the near-term are in any concern of being spec out of jobs? Absolutely not. I hope that helps Paul.\nPaul Roger : Yeah, that [Indiscernible]. Just 1 very quick one, probably for Jim. I noticed you'd increase your capex guidance. Is that investment in Lehigh Hanson or is it something else? Just basically wondering how much capex Lehigh maybe needs going forward.\nJim Nickolas : That's right. You've got it exactly right, Paul. That is -- the amount -- that mass amount that we increased it in a new guidance versus the old guidance is due to the acquired assets Lehigh Hanson West.\nPaul Roger : Great. Thank you.\nWard Nye : Thank you. Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thomson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer : Hey, good morning, guys. Great quarter. Hey, Ward, I wanted to ask you high level about the residential market. Some of the national numbers show, I guess you'd call it may be a leveling off in the data, but I was curious what you're seeing under the surface.\nWard Nye : No look, that's such a great question. It goes back to a lot of what we spoke about at the Analyst Investor Day. So, I would say several things are worth knowing at least again, as we think about a Texas to Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now increasingly California. We came into this period of time in ARPU with remarkably underbuilt conditions, particularly with respect to single-family. We think the population dynamics will continue to be strong in those states. I mean, here's some specific color, if we're looking at Texas population growth, the residential section, at least for us in Texas is red hot. Texas comprises almost 9% of the U.S. population, but accounts for almost 34% of the country's population growth. And if we're looking at DFW, it's led the nation in the Metro growth for at least 4 years running.  And by the way, the Houston area's second. So, this is underscores again why we thought that move, that enhanced move in Texas is so important, in - housing is such a driver there. If we look in Colorado, the biggest issue that we have in Colorado is they frankly need more supply. The demand is there. Colorado population has grown 14% since 2010. So that's almost a million people. They gained the house (ph) seat in this last few population. So again, we can -- we anticipate continued strong housing growth in Colorado.  North Carolina just continues to grow dramatically. We see it here in our backyard every day between what's happening in Charlotte and in Raleigh, Durham. When I moved by North Carolina, I think this is important, is places like Greensboro, I think I might have mentioned early in the year, D.R. Horton has announced a plan to build 1,000 homes, single-families subdivision there in [Indiscernible] -- and the triad are up 28% year-over-year. So again, these are powerful numbers. If we're looking at Atlanta, the Atlanta single-family housing starts in our approaching 35,000. That's up on a trailing 12 basis, almost 38% but it's not just Atlanta, we're seeing that in Atlanta, we're seeing that in Savannah, and even in smaller markets like Augusta, that have continued to be very attractive. And even single-family housing in Florida and keep in mind that's really not the market that we're in there. We are a niche player in Florida in basically public transportation or infrastructure. But single-family housing in Florida is up 37% on trailing 12 months. And again, Florida has added 2.7 residences since 2010. So, if we look at those numbers, then come back and also lay on top of that those two different propositions that I spoke up just a few minutes ago relative to California. On SB9 and SBI0, if we are of the view that single-family housing is going to stay strong for a while and that aggregate tends to follow that with a very high correlative factor. And if we're assuming, this is what we think is going to happen. We think single-family stats in '21 go to about $1.2 million. We think in '22, they probably go to around 1.4 million and in '23 to about 1.5 million. Those are heady numbers but here's what's important to remember.  If we're right and they go to 1.2 million in 2021, that's 2,000 levels, and the U.S. has added 48 million people since then. If we're right, and then go to 1.4 million in ' 22, that's a 2,003 levels. And if we're right and it goes to 1.5 in '23, that's 2,003 and 2,004 levels. again, on a much higher population base. So, I've tried to give you some color around specific markets that matter to us. But I've also tried to give you some numbers broadly nationally that we think are relevant and we think are worth keeping in the back or front your mind.\nAdam Thalhimer : Okay. Great color. Thanks, Ward.\nWard Nye : Adam, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. My question is on cement capacity. I think you're adding some finishing capacity in Texas. I think it's coming online in maybe 2 years. But how about Lehigh assets from a utilization standpoint and how are you contemplating the need, if at all, for additional capacity there?\nWard Nye : We're going -- that's part of what we're looking at very carefully right now. Clearly, they don't have to fest in California that we have in Texas. Right now, we've got a million ton more capacity in Texas, and obviously adding more at Midlothian. Part of what we're wanting to make sure right now is that we've got those facilities in California running optimally where they are. Our view is, we invest in the business once we know we've got it where it needs to be.  So, we're going through the capital process and looking at it very carefully as we speak. As Jim indicated earlier in his conversation with Paul, the increase in capex that you see is almost uniquely tied to what's going on at the Lehigh Hanson's West Region that we now have. And certainly, a significant portion of that is going to the Smith Business. Jim, anything you want to add to that?\nJim Nickolas : No, I think you've nailed it. It should be in line with what you've seen historically from us, our CapEx spend in total. So as our sales grow, including Lehigh Hanson business, our CapEx will grow commensurately. So, there should be no -- nothing unusual versus past history. Around 9% of sales is probably a good starting point to think about [Indiscernible] CapEx for us.\nGarik Shmois : Okay, great. Thanks for the help.\nWard Nye : Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Citi, your line is open.\nAndy Neri : Good morning.\nWard Nye : Good morning [Indiscernible]\nAndy Neri : Ward, when you look at Lehigh and maybe Tiller, too, I understand you're excited about the opportunity. Are there any parts of the acquired businesses that might not be the best fit for Martin Marietta long term and then maybe going the other way. Are there opportunities for further acquisitions and '22 or should we really think of you as being heads down and deleveraging mode until you get to 2.5 or below 2.5 returns.\nWard Nye : Those are great questions. The thing that I would always say is where we've been. You further say that, if you were in an aggregate supply Company and that's the way we think about our businesses first. And so, I would always encourage you to remember that with us. At the same time, for example, could we go in and bought the business in Minnesota, that is the Tiller business. That does have a hot mix component to it, but part of what's so different about that is it doesn't have to lay down component to it.  So, if you think about really what I think makes Martin Marietta different from many, is we're not so much in the contracting business. We will take that stone in Minnesota in some respects, add liquid to it turn it into black pavement and sell it FOB at the facility. So, it's our number 1. Aggregate [Indiscernible] is the right way to think of us, 2. Being more focused on materials is the right way to think of u. Lastly, with respect to growing the business, Look, at the end of the transaction, clearly, our debt-to - EBITDA range is a little bit above 3 times.  As you know, we like to stay in the range of 2 to 2.5 times. We think that that's actually going to deleverage very nicely over the next year to 18 months. I think it's possible that if we get toward the end of next year, we could be back toward the high end of our range, that's really, I think doing great work can deleveraging the business. I think we have added immense value to this business by doing not acquisitions, but by doing the right acquisitions. By doing these transactions that we've done, we have opened up a series of new corridors.  And if you go back in time and you look at the way that we've grown our business, we have been focused uniquely on corridors of growth, whether it's I-95, I-85, Interstate 40, whether it's I-25 in Colorado and now increasingly on I-5 in California. So, aggregates [Indiscernible] the right way to think of us, a Company that wants to continue to do the right deals in the right markets is the right way to think of us and heavy-side oriented is where we will continue to reside, Anthony, so I hope that helps.\nAndy Neri : That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nWard Nye : Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Wilson with Raymond James, your line is open?\nJoshua Wilson : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWard Nye : Sure, Josh.\nJoshua Wilson : Just to clarify some of the moving parts on energy, can you give the change in the energy dollar headwind for the 2021 guidance?\nJim Nickolas : For the guidance, it was about $10 million for the old guidance to new guidance.\nJoshua Wilson : $10 million incremental. Okay. Good. And then you talked about green shoots on light non-res, any signs of moderation or any concerns on the heavy non-res?\nWard Nye : No, not particularly. In fact, I would say not at all. The heavy non-res has continued to be really quite good and part of what I'm encouraged by, for example the energy portion of that has actually not been particularly good. So, it's been more driven by warehousing data, warehousing etc. As you may recall in some of the commentary I was sharing before, we're seeing more activity in West Texas on energy than we've seen for a while.  At the same time, for example, the Port Arthur LNG facility that's been on some degree of hold for a while, are saying respectfully is really anticipating some bid refreshing on that, in this quarter. And we may see some activity there as early as Q1 2022. Not a job that we'd want at this point but still, nonetheless, seeing that type of activity on heavy, we actually think is quite attractive, Josh.\nJoshua Wilson : Great. I'll turn it back over.\nWard Nye : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Meeker with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nDavid Meeker : Yes. Good morning, everyone. And great quarter, Ward. Congrats to the team.\nJim Nickolas : Yeah. Good morning.\nWard Nye : Thank you.\nDavid Meeker : I guess I wanted to just ask about pricing here and, certainly, the outlook for 2022 is obviously very encouraging. But I guess I'm trying to understand what happened in Q3 and I fully appreciate the mix benefit or mix liability with the base stone and the excess fill material. But you're attracting a 3.4% coming through the first half and you dropped out at 2.2 on organic basis, so I'm hoping you can give us some sense of what organic growth and pricing might have looked like excluding the base stone, the excess fill material, and -- just start with that if you would, please.\nWard Nye : Yeah. Now, look quick answers. We've been very comfortably in those zones that we talked about earlier. And I think when, again, David, if it's 900 -- if it's almost a million tons of fill, and fill largely looked at broadly as almost a waste product. Obviously, we sold it for profit because we didn't have it on the books for anything, but it is a fill product. And if you're looking at what was a fairly significant movement on base, particularly in that Raleigh market, Of all the things that I worry at night about, aggregate pricing is not on my list.  Those -- purely simply those are the drivers. The other thing and I know your question were on organic, but I do think it's important to keep in mind when you look at it all rolled up. Stone pricing in the acquired Tiller operations are about $5 a ton lower than our Heritage number. So again, when you do an all-in number with that, it's clearly has optically a dilutive effect. And then when you feather in nearly a million tons of funds, again, it will have an optical effect. But I think to your point, the mid-years, I think really did underscore the strength of the market. And to give you a sense of what we saw in the East Division, this really means in the Carolinas, was a bucket ton up on clean stone effective July 1 and even $0.50 on base effective July 1. And then Southwest, we saw in North Texas up $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1.  In Austin, up a bucket ton and in Hunter Stone, which is in New Braunfels, $0.50 to up a bucket ton, and then in Garwood up a bucket ton on August 1. So, I think all those at least in the way that I'm watching it and measuring the cadence, David, gives me a high degree of confidence in what we're anticipating next year that and probably more importantly together with conversations we've had with our customers. So, I hope that helps.\nDavid Meeker : Yeah. So just to be clear, as you look at that organic number excluding the base stone in the excess fill material, you're saying that pricing would have been up sequentially excluding those items, but your price [Indiscernible] up sequentially.\nWard Nye : Yes, it would.\nDavid Meeker : And was there anything different in terms of the initial third quarter attraction rates on these third quarter price increases that -- Just comparing that with prior price increases, is there anything that was maybe different this time?\nWard Nye : No, not really. The only thing that I would say is probably consistent this time is whenever you do a midyear, you're only going to actually see a very limited portion of those go in the year and what inputs you put it. I mean, historically, what I would've said, if you did a mid-year truly on July 1 or June 30, if you got 20% or 25% of it in the year in which you put it in, you'd be fortunate. So really, it's more of a play into the following year.\nDavid Meeker : Great. Good. Thanks very much. That's all I got.\nWard Nye : Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time.

            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta has continued growth and record results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan. And with fewer reportable and lost time incidents than this time last year, our Company-wide safety incident rates are surpassing world-class levels.  I'm proud to report that we are on track to deliver the most profitable and safest year in our Company's history. We're also excited about the progress we're making on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further position our Company for sustainable long-term operational and financial success. On October 1st, we welcome more than 1200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team as we successfully completed the acquisition of Lehigh Hanson's West Region business. With this outstanding team, strong business in key assets now a part of our offering, we're well-positioned to benefit from favorable market dynamics and accelerating public and private construction activity in important California and Arizona regions, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix.  It also provides new growth platforms for our continued geographic expansion. I'm grateful to our colleagues for the dedication and perseverance in their efforts to complete the acquisition, the second largest in our Company's history. We look forward to working together to seamlessly integrate the Lehigh West Operations, quickly realize synergies, and deliver significant stakeholder value. Integration activities are progressing as planned from both an operational and customer-facing perspective. As highlighted in today's release, we once again established record results for revenues and gross profit for both the quarter and year-to-date. To recap for the first 9 months of 2021, our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to a record $1.1 billion. Both our building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses continue to capitalize on the ongoing economic recovery.  During the quarter, organic shipment and pricing growth combined with value-enhancing acquisitions, more than offset higher-than-expected energy-related costs and contributed to our record setting results. Specifically, on a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 18% to $1.5 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 11% to $450 million, adjusted EBITDA of $490 million increased 13% on a comparable basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.25 grew 11% on a comparable basis.  As a reminder, the prior year quarter included $70 million or $0.87 per diluted share up non-recurring gains on surplus plan sales, and divested assets that affect quarter-over-quarter comparability. Now, for a review of our third quarter operating performance. We continue to experience growing product demand across our 3 primary end-use markets. Organic aggregate shipments increased 6% notwithstanding contractor capacity constraints and wet weather in several markets that govern the overall pace of construction activity. Notably, all divisions contributed to this solid growth, demonstrating our ability to capitalize on the strong underlying demand trends across our geographic footprint. Total aggregate shipments, including shipments from acquired operations increased 10%. Organic aggregates average selling price increased 2%, reflecting a higher percentage of lower-priced based on shipments during the quarter. Additionally, our East Division, which has selling prices in excess of our corporate average, had the opportunity to meet customer needs with a low -priced excess fill product that had we not shipped, we otherwise would have incurred costs to relocate.  We expect shipments of this excess fill material, which are profitable and not a substitute for higher-value products to continue through the remainder of the year. That's why we updated our full-year 2021 organic pricing growth guidance to now range from 2.5% to 3.5%. To be clear, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive. In fact, supported by strong underlying demand and rapid cost inflation in the broader economy, we successfully implemented midyear price increases in the Carolinas and Texas.  These actions, combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility, bode well for meaningful pricing acceleration in 2022. Our Texas cement business established a new quarterly record for shipments, which increased 4% to over 1 million tons. Large and diversified projects, recovering energy sector activity, and incremental pull-through from our internal downstream customers, supported record monthly shipment levels in both August and September. Cement pricing increased 8% as the second round of price increases this year went into effect on September 1st.  Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments increased 23% driven by the large non-residential projects and operations acquired late last year in Texas. Concrete pricing grew 2% following the implementation of midyear price increases in Texas. Additionally, we've announced a third price increase in the Dallas, Fort Worth market effect October 1. Asphalt shipments increased 116% overall, driven by contributions from our Minnesota -based operations acquired earlier this year.  Our Colorado asphalt and paving business experienced shipment declines and supply disruptions from midsummer liquid asphalt allocations throughout the Rocky Mountains. That circumstances now been resolved. Despite these short-term issues, market fundamentals remain strong across the Colorado Front Range. Organic asphalt pricing improved modestly. Before discussing our preliminary 2022 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of our financial results and liquidity. Jim. Thanks, Jim. Looking beyond 2021, Martin Marietta remains well-positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals and secular demand trends across our geographic footprint. Expanded federal and state level infrastructure investment, single-family housing strength, heavy industrial projects of scale, and light non-residential recovery should support growing construction activity and contribute to attractive pricing acceleration for heavy-side building materials for years to come. Importantly, we have both the ability and the capacity to supply these needed products, and supported by our locally led pricing strategy, we'll do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. While navigating an imperfect legislative process, our nation is nonetheless on the cusp of achieving the most significant infrastructure action of this century. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which contains a 5-year surface transportation reauthorization and provides $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges, and other hard infrastructure projects passed the U.S. Senate in August, with 69 bi partisan votes. Though the U.S. House of Representatives could not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill last week before the then current short-term extension of the federal highway and public transportation programs expired on October 31st, the house and senate did approve a short-term program extension, keeping surface transportation funds flowing to the States through December 3rd.  The consensus opinion with which we strongly agree is that this important legislation will be signed into law before year-end. Aside from the overall economic growth we expect to occur with the increased federal transportation investment, the steps we've taken over the past decade to responsibly grow and expand our footprint will also benefit Martin Marietta 's near and long-term outlook. Project lettings for our Company's top 5 States Department of Transportation or DOTs, continue to positively trend. Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 building materials revenues are well-positioned from both the DOT funding and resource perspective to efficiently deploy increased federal and state transportation dollars and advanced the growing number of projects and their backlogs. Notably, California, the nation's most popular state and the world's fifth largest economy, becomes a top state for Martin Marietta following the Lehigh West acquisition.  Caltrans, California's Department of Transportation, manages a $17 billion annual budget. Additionally, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, commonly referred to as Senate Bill 1 or SB1 provides $54 billion or approximately $5 billion annually through 2030 to fund state and local road, freeway, and rail projects. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 36% of third quarter organic shipments, showing sequential growth since this year's second quarter, but still well below our 10-year historical average of 43%.  Non-residential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data-centers. We've also seen early signs of recovery in light commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Atlanta, Denver, and the Texas Triangle. Light non-residential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022, given that it typically follows single-family residential development. Aggregate shipment to the non -residential accounted for 35% of third quarter organic shipments.  Across our cost-to-cost footprint, single family residential [Indiscernible] are expected to remain robust despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times. Significant under-building in commensurate with notable population gains over the past decade and accelerated deorganisation support these trends. Importantly, single-family housing is 2-3 times more aggregates-intensive than multi-family construction, given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities.  Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 24% of third quarter organic shipments. In summary, we believe our industry is about to see public and private sector construction activity coalesce for the first time since its most recent 2005 peak, supporting both increased shipments and an attractive pricing environment for construction materials. For 2022, our preliminary view anticipates organic aggregates shipments will increase in the low-to-mid single-digits, As contractor labor shortages and logistics challenges continued to impact on otherwise robust demand environment.  Underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in 2022 organic aggregates pricing. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our record setting safety, operational, and financial performance, and look forward to continuing to build on that momentum into the fourth quarter and 2022. As a result of our thoughtfully developed and consistently executed strategic priorities, our Company's future is bright.  With our steadfast commitment to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices in store execution, Martin Marietta intends to build the safest, best performing and most durable aggregates lead public Company poised to deliver attractive growth and superior value for all of our stakeholders. If the Operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you, Trey. Happy to. Trey, thank you for your question. I think several things are worth noting. One, we saw a nice series of midyear price increases this year, and we saw that in two markets that matter a lot for us. We saw that in Texas and we saw that in the Carolinas. So that immediately starts setting the framework for next year. Keep in mind as I outlined in the prepared remarks, part of what we've seen this year as an optimal headwind is frankly a higher degree of base sales that we've seen particularly in the East, as well as some [Indiscernible] sales that have gone out of the East.  What I think is important to keep in mind Trey is the pricing range that you see is really a heritage driven range. In other words, we're not taking into account what we believe is going to happen in California and that, we're not taking into account what we believe can happen in Minnesota and that. As reminder, those markets historically have been below corporate average. So, if I reflect on where we're positioning toward next year on the conversations that we have had with our customers to-date and what we believe the overall economic environment is likely to be, we have a very high level of confidence in the ASPS that we're talking about for next year.  You had also asked specifically about cement, which is the -- a perfectly fair question. As we look at cement, several things that are worth noting as we think about the year that's wrapping up as well as the year that we're going into. Keep in mind, several things have happened this year. 1. Our price increase in cement in Texas in April was $9 a ton. We came back in September and the second price increase, that was at $8 a ton. That's the first time we've seen a mid-year of that sort since 2014.  Again, I think underscoring nice overall pricing momentum. If we're looking at what we're anticipating next year, we're anticipating a price increase in cement up $12 a ton. As a practical matter we're looking at that effective January 1 in California, we're looking at that relative to April 1 in Texas. So, a little bit of a different date between those 2 states, but still a very common number on focusing. We also believe in total candor(ph) that if some of the governing aspects around the volume would go away, volume could actually be better.  It's interesting is when looking at volume today and I'd mentioned this trait because I think this also has an effect on pricing from an emotional perspective as well as others. But, what our team in Texas would tell us today is if there was more trucking available, say for example in the Dallas, Fort Worth market, We could be selling on a daily basis, 3% to 5% more tonnage than we're selling today. So, I think all of those factors call us to underscore what we believe 2022 is lining up to be a very attractive pricing environment for the Company. You bet you. Take care. No, thank you, Brian. I'll start with the latter part first, and that is what we've done in looking at volume next year is assuming that we're going to continue to see same governors around volume that we have this year. So again, I think we've taken a very responsible view at volume next year, and potentially, if you see some of these labor, transportation, and other backlogs or issues resolve themselves. It could be better next year. If we're thinking about overall customer backlog and the way that they're thinking about their business, here is the way that I would at least encourage you to think about that. As we are looking over all across the aggregates business, we're seeing it about 15% ahead of prior year levels based on what our customers are telling us. And there is a nice break. If we're looking in the East Group, again, that's up almost 14% based on what customers are saying to us. If we're looking in the West group, that's up around 18% based on customers are telling them. What I think is important as well, we came into the year with very attractive cement backlog. Cement, year-over-year is modestly down but I think what's important is we have some very notable projects that are in the pipeline right now that we think actually adds to that pretty considerably. And importantly, as we look at our Magnesia Specialties business, we're looking at record customer backlogs and we see very robust line business going into 2022 and we see some chemicals tailwinds going into the new year as well. So, it's consistent with the comments that you heard that I shared in my prepared remarks. This is 1 of those instances where we feel like we're seeing public and private come together in a very attractive, very powerful way. And part of what I think is telling about this one is we believe it has the capacity, particularly if we got the new highway bill to be in place, not just for a matter of quarters, progress for a matter of years. So, Bryan, I hope that helps. You bet. Good morning, Jer. I'm not sure that I can give you something on that that's going to be precise and give you good direction on it, because I think so much of that's going to be driven. It can be particularly in fourth-quarter by seasonality and what's happening in some parts of the country as opposed to others. What I will tell you is the conversations we've had with customers, or conversations that we've already had. The correspondents that we were going to have with customers to basically affirm for our pricing for next year has already gone out. Really, Jerry, I think if there's risk to pricing next year.  Frankly, it's more on the upside as opposed to the downside because the numbers that we gave you in the release and that I referenced in my prepared remarks are heritage numbers only. And, obviously, part of what contractors are seeing today, and I'm sure they're seeing across a whole host of inputs, is an inflationary environment unlike anything that they've seen for a while. The other thing to keep in mind is if you go back and look at whether it's CPI, PPI or otherwise over a long period of time and by that, I don't meet a year or 2, I mean decades. What you'll find is aggregate pricing has consistently outperformed that metric and this year actually was behind it just a bit. So, I expect to see that gap made up next year, Jerry. So that's how I would think about that. But you're right. It does vary and there will be some markets that go January 1, there will be some that will go April 1. As a practical matter, Jerry. because there's not that much heavy-side activity that occurs in January and February. Keep in mind, we've launched that, for example, that the last 2 weeks of March can make or break the first quarter. So, whether they go into effect in January or whether they go into effect in April, typically for us isn't that moving.  We're trying to make sure that we maintain your relationships with customers that are so important and don't put them in a position that they find themselves in anyway dislocated, so we've tried to remain relatively consistent from a timing perspective. But again, we don't feel like the timing from January to April, given the seasonality effect of those period of months, is going to be at moment. Thank you for the question, Jerry. I would say that the integration is actually going quite well in all of them. We've got a single process that we're utilizing for this integration, so 1 team continues to look at it. The nice thing about this is the integration are occurring, obviously in the West, in the Central and of the Southwest. So, no particular team is overwhelmed with what's going on. Operationally, we're very pleased with the way that it's going.  The teams that have become part of Martin Marietta team to this process, have proven to be every bit as good as we thought that they would. I continue to be moved by what I feel we can do relative to bring commercial excellence to these operations. And I think particularly in California, that's likely to be the upside that we're going to see there. But again, if you think about what's happened this year, it's going over $3 billion worth of deals.  So, if we go back and look at Tiller, which came in at the end of April, SCC that can in at the end of July and again, Lehigh Hanson's came in at the beginning of October. By any stretch that's a big M&A year for Martin Marietta. And we're very pleased with the people and we're very pleased with the operations and very pleased with the site. So, I appreciate the question. I'm happy to tell you there have been no negative surprises. You bet. Take care Jerry. Phil, thank you for the question. I think several things. 1. We're going to give you a good sense of where we believe those businesses will be when we come out in February next year. Part of what you'll see if you go to the supplemental information with today's release is you'll get a good snapshot, particularly relative to The Lehigh West on what the tonnages look like in aggregate cement ready-mix and asphalt. So that will give you a nice way to back into some of that. You will also see a nice '21 -- 2021 budget EBITDA contribution. So again, I think that can put you there.  With respect to the overall pricing as you would imagine, we've got a nice blend of new products in Martin Marietta, but importantly, Heritage Martin Marietta's players, particularly in California, that are working together in that marketplace. I can tell you that our correspondents on pricing went out to our customers last week. These are live conversations -- by the way, they've all been very good conversations, as I indicated in one of the earlier questions, if I had to speculate today, my guess would be on a percentage basis. We will likely see ASPS on a percentage basis on the newly acquired operations on percentages that will be higher than here in Martin Marietta. So again, I don't see a downside right there, I see potential upside opportunity in those markets. And again, to your point, we can probably, if I really wanted to dig deep, be a little bit more specific with you on Lehigh Hanson's the same time on mindful that we've owned that business were about 32 days. And our sense is, let's have it for a little bit longer than 32 days before we get into too much detail on that. But hopefully, the direction I've given you and the supplemental information relative to tonnage EBITDA contributions, where we are relative to the organic business on ASPS, in my view that the acquired operations will likely over-achieve that, gives you a sense of how we look at that. No. As I said, I certainly don't see downside to aggregate price in next year. And if we're looking at the film material that's gone out this year in the East in particular year to date, Phil, this will give you a sense of it. It's been about 900,000 tonnes. And part of what's happened here over the last -- during the last quarter as well is we started shipping some stone on a large NCDOT project that's here and the Raleigh that was bid about 2 years ago.  So again, those are just some of the more optical issues. Something that I think is worth always keeping in mind, Phil, is, when [Indiscernible] is going in a year like this, what you know is going to happen, is the clean stones want to come either, because at some point you're going to put either asphalt or concrete on top of the clean stones. And we actually see those clean stone pricings -- prices moving in a very attractive way. Thank you, Phil. Great question, Stan and thank you for asking that. That's a business that performs quarter-after-quarter extraordinarily well and never gets depressed that team deserves. Look, you saw what I did, too and that was record revenues through up 30% over the prior-year quarter. I mean, several things were happening when it's a strong metal mining activity around world. We're seeing good activity in steel. To your point, in many respects, we are kept -- we're running at capacity on volumes than in that marketplace right now. Pricing was up nearly 4%. We think pricing may have some nice upside to it.  One thing that's worth noticing though, is if we look at where domestic steel is now, steel is running at about 80% -- almost 85%. That's up from Q2 last year when it found the bottom. It's up almost 51% since then. The other thing that I think is really impressive in that business when you look at the margins at 39%, and you take into account that natural gas pricing for Q3 was up 26%. And if we look at really what natural gas pricing has looked at for a longer period of time than that. If we go back to January 1 this year, I want to say in January, net gas pricing was at [Indiscernible], it's up almost $2.44 since then, almost a 146%. So, I guess what I would say is what we'd like to grow that business in particular? Point to your question, the short answer is we would. We've looked at ways to grow that business in the past, we will continue to do that. Are we largely at capacity at Woodville and Manistee today large that we are? Do we have the ability, on occasion, and will we continue to look at refining our products out of those 2 different facilities to make sure we're doing more high margin products? The short answer there is yes, we will.  So, the focus will be on continuing to control costs, which they do extraordinarily well. Being a price leader, which is something they've been focused on, continuing to look for ways to add to that business. We'd liked to do it but, in the meantime, making sure that we continue to refine the products that we're putting out. So, I would suggest you, Stanley, it's probably a 4- or 5-fold approach to that business. Thank you so much, Stanley Courtney, [Indiscernible]. Thank you for the question. What -- Jim and I will bifurcate this. I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing going on in the market. I want Jim to come back and talk specifically about some of the issues that we had in maintenance this quarter and part of what we've seen in inventories. But here's what I would say overall, if we look at the volume, the volume is not too very attractive, so it's a 4% overall increase. We've had some July rain that slowed things down in Central and South Texas.  So, if we're looking at what was happening coming out of [Indiscernible], that was down about 3%. Now, the flip side is we saw very nice volumes coming out of North Texas at Midlothian, up about 6.7%. We also saw, in a percentage basis, very nice percentages up in West Texas. Now, what I'll tell you is, percentages on West Texas and volumes on West Texas tell two different stories. Because you can have a very big percentage, because the volumes have been overall quite low.  But what I'm happy to see is at least on a year-to-date basis, is West Texas volumes were up almost 66% as we continue to see mining do better. If we look in North Texas again, all by itself in September, that was up 25%. So, we saw a record volume quarter coming out of cement. Now we did have some maintenance issues that I want Jim to speak to, and I'll preface it with we're done with maintenance for the year on the big -- taking the kilns down. And then we had some inventory issues that he can walk you through that, I think, will give you some great color so, Jim over to you, please. Court, I have a quick comment. Could give you a quick snapshot on that. So really for Jim is 15% of the impact was from diesel. If we look at energy across the entire business, and then a $28 million almost 2X bet if we look all in on energy, so I just want to make sure you had those 2 numbers. But it'll probably be largely cleared up by the end of the year. I think the fill will be gone. And again, I think a lot of it it's going to depend on how much space can contractors put down in effectively Q4, but yeah, that's going to be the only issue, Courtney. And as I indicated before that the nice thing is you know what's going to go on top of the base at some point. Thank you. I think the good news is, Brent, where if we look at our top markets which are going to be Texas, Colorado, now California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. They're all going to be pretty solid underlying economic markets and with most of those states having very high population inflows coming to them. And from our perspective, it's not so much an issue of supply. We're in a position to supply the materials, I think to your point, it's going to be more matter of labor.  And frankly, it's going to be a contractor timing perspective on when they're going to hire labor. One of the things that I'm at least defining on, Brent, is I think that's going to be one of the great collateral benefits from the highway bill on its best. Because when contractors have a sense that there are backlogs and their backlogs for a period of years are going to look very good. They're likely to hire, I think that's particularly true when we're looking at public works because public works, as you know, tend to come with liquidated damages if they're not finished in a timely manner.  But I think it's a practical matter that's going to be driving some of that. But again, if we look overall at the way our top states are positioned, they're positioned really well. If we're looking at TxDOT, their FY2022 lettings are set to exceed $10 billion. If we're looking at Colorado, they're looking at the DOT forecast that's up $850 million. NCDOT has returned to historical averages which puts them in a $5 billion a year budget. Georgia infrastructure look strong with additional $225 million of infrastructure investment. Florida is near record levels with very attractive backlogs.  But here's some of the things that are moved by -- you heard me mention Caltrans there budget, SB1 in the prepared remarks. But I didn't speak to our issues like SB9 and SBI0 in California that's allowing property owners to split single-family lots into 2 lots and streamlining of zoning or rezoning process. Because what we think that does in that market is it brings housing back in ways that that state hasn't seen for a while.  And as you recall [Indiscernible], from our analyst and Investor Day, so much goodness in heavy-side space tends to follow what's happening with single-family with a lag. If we see the highway bill, if we see the hiring that I think comes behind the highway bill, if we see the public work that I think we're going to see, and we continue to see that type of private work That's driven by revs. I think a lot of these supply chain and employee labor issues worked their way out. I don't think it's going to be immediate. And again, I think that's part of the government we've put on next year, but that's a long answer, but you asked a really good question and I think it has a lot of moving parts. Thank you, Brent. No, Paul, thank you for your question very much. And Paul, I think that is something that we are cognizant enough that we're sensitive to I think in the fullness of time, recycle will play a bigger role than it's going to play in the next 5 or 10 years. And what do I mean by that? That I think we are going to go have to be looking to utilize recycled concrete more as a base product. I think we're going to be looking at higher degrees of recycled asphalt or RAP that used an asphalt mixes. Today, in many respects, you might see RAP in the, let's call it 20% portions of asphalt. I think you could see that going up into the 30% in the fullness of time. The primary driver of that being liquid, 1 reason I mentioned those 2 things in particular, Paul is if you look at the transactions at least 2 of the 3 that we've done this year, it's somewhat mindful of that.  If we're looking at the SCC Materials transaction that we did in July, That's basically buying a recycled business on concrete and selling that recycled concrete as an aggregate, and selling that in Houston, Texas where we have a significant presence and keep in mind part of what Tiller does for us in that marketplace -- I'm sorry, SCC is it adds a series of new yards for us. More specifically, it adds around 10 and we had a very attractive position in that marketplace with the existing rail yards that we had. So, to your point, it expands our footprint, but importantly, it adds new product offerings. Now similarly, if we look at the business that we've had in Minnesota at Tiller at the end of April, that's a stone business and it's a hot mix business, but it's not lay down business. So again, part of what that's going to allow us to do is to make sure that we're looking at percentages of [Indiscernible], how we're going to utilize that going forward. And the other piece of Tiller that I think has been important for us, is this part of that business we also picked up about a 100,000 tons worth of tank farm capacity in that marketplace, so we also have the ability to look at energy going forward in some modestly different ways with a fiscal hedge, because it allows us to hedge physically about 60% of our need for liquid in that relevant geographic market during the course of any one year. So, do we think we will see more recycle? Yes. Are we ourselves -- positioning ourselves to more of that? Yes. Do I think spec aggregates in the near-term are in any concern of being spec out of jobs? Absolutely not. I hope that helps Paul. Thank you. Paul. No look, that's such a great question. It goes back to a lot of what we spoke about at the Analyst Investor Day. So, I would say several things are worth knowing at least again, as we think about a Texas to Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and now increasingly California. We came into this period of time in ARPU with remarkably underbuilt conditions, particularly with respect to single-family. We think the population dynamics will continue to be strong in those states. I mean, here's some specific color, if we're looking at Texas population growth, the residential section, at least for us in Texas is red hot. Texas comprises almost 9% of the U.S. population, but accounts for almost 34% of the country's population growth. And if we're looking at DFW, it's led the nation in the Metro growth for at least 4 years running.  And by the way, the Houston area's second. So, this is underscores again why we thought that move, that enhanced move in Texas is so important, in - housing is such a driver there. If we look in Colorado, the biggest issue that we have in Colorado is they frankly need more supply. The demand is there. Colorado population has grown 14% since 2010. So that's almost a million people. They gained the house (ph) seat in this last few population. So again, we can -- we anticipate continued strong housing growth in Colorado.  North Carolina just continues to grow dramatically. We see it here in our backyard every day between what's happening in Charlotte and in Raleigh, Durham. When I moved by North Carolina, I think this is important, is places like Greensboro, I think I might have mentioned early in the year, D.R. Horton has announced a plan to build 1,000 homes, single-families subdivision there in [Indiscernible] -- and the triad are up 28% year-over-year. So again, these are powerful numbers. If we're looking at Atlanta, the Atlanta single-family housing starts in our approaching 35,000. That's up on a trailing 12 basis, almost 38% but it's not just Atlanta, we're seeing that in Atlanta, we're seeing that in Savannah, and even in smaller markets like Augusta, that have continued to be very attractive. And even single-family housing in Florida and keep in mind that's really not the market that we're in there. We are a niche player in Florida in basically public transportation or infrastructure. But single-family housing in Florida is up 37% on trailing 12 months. And again, Florida has added 2.7 residences since 2010. So, if we look at those numbers, then come back and also lay on top of that those two different propositions that I spoke up just a few minutes ago relative to California. On SB9 and SBI0, if we are of the view that single-family housing is going to stay strong for a while and that aggregate tends to follow that with a very high correlative factor. And if we're assuming, this is what we think is going to happen. We think single-family stats in '21 go to about $1.2 million. We think in '22, they probably go to around 1.4 million and in '23 to about 1.5 million. Those are heady numbers but here's what's important to remember.  If we're right and they go to 1.2 million in 2021, that's 2,000 levels, and the U.S. has added 48 million people since then. If we're right, and then go to 1.4 million in ' 22, that's a 2,003 levels. And if we're right and it goes to 1.5 in '23, that's 2,003 and 2,004 levels. again, on a much higher population base. So, I've tried to give you some color around specific markets that matter to us. But I've also tried to give you some numbers broadly nationally that we think are relevant and we think are worth keeping in the back or front your mind. Adam, thank you. We're going -- that's part of what we're looking at very carefully right now. Clearly, they don't have to fest in California that we have in Texas. Right now, we've got a million ton more capacity in Texas, and obviously adding more at Midlothian. Part of what we're wanting to make sure right now is that we've got those facilities in California running optimally where they are. Our view is, we invest in the business once we know we've got it where it needs to be.  So, we're going through the capital process and looking at it very carefully as we speak. As Jim indicated earlier in his conversation with Paul, the increase in capex that you see is almost uniquely tied to what's going on at the Lehigh Hanson's West Region that we now have. And certainly, a significant portion of that is going to the Smith Business. Jim, anything you want to add to that? Thanks, Garik. Good morning [Indiscernible] Those are great questions. The thing that I would always say is where we've been. You further say that, if you were in an aggregate supply Company and that's the way we think about our businesses first. And so, I would always encourage you to remember that with us. At the same time, for example, could we go in and bought the business in Minnesota, that is the Tiller business. That does have a hot mix component to it, but part of what's so different about that is it doesn't have to lay down component to it.  So, if you think about really what I think makes Martin Marietta different from many, is we're not so much in the contracting business. We will take that stone in Minnesota in some respects, add liquid to it turn it into black pavement and sell it FOB at the facility. So, it's our number 1. Aggregate [Indiscernible] is the right way to think of us, 2. Being more focused on materials is the right way to think of u. Lastly, with respect to growing the business, Look, at the end of the transaction, clearly, our debt-to - EBITDA range is a little bit above 3 times.  As you know, we like to stay in the range of 2 to 2.5 times. We think that that's actually going to deleverage very nicely over the next year to 18 months. I think it's possible that if we get toward the end of next year, we could be back toward the high end of our range, that's really, I think doing great work can deleveraging the business. I think we have added immense value to this business by doing not acquisitions, but by doing the right acquisitions. By doing these transactions that we've done, we have opened up a series of new corridors.  And if you go back in time and you look at the way that we've grown our business, we have been focused uniquely on corridors of growth, whether it's I-95, I-85, Interstate 40, whether it's I-25 in Colorado and now increasingly on I-5 in California. So, aggregates [Indiscernible] the right way to think of us, a Company that wants to continue to do the right deals in the right markets is the right way to think of us and heavy-side oriented is where we will continue to reside, Anthony, so I hope that helps. Thanks. Sure, Josh. No, not particularly. In fact, I would say not at all. The heavy non-res has continued to be really quite good and part of what I'm encouraged by, for example the energy portion of that has actually not been particularly good. So, it's been more driven by warehousing data, warehousing etc. As you may recall in some of the commentary I was sharing before, we're seeing more activity in West Texas on energy than we've seen for a while.  At the same time, for example, the Port Arthur LNG facility that's been on some degree of hold for a while, are saying respectfully is really anticipating some bid refreshing on that, in this quarter. And we may see some activity there as early as Q1 2022. Not a job that we'd want at this point but still, nonetheless, seeing that type of activity on heavy, we actually think is quite attractive, Josh. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Now, look quick answers. We've been very comfortably in those zones that we talked about earlier. And I think when, again, David, if it's 900 -- if it's almost a million tons of fill, and fill largely looked at broadly as almost a waste product. Obviously, we sold it for profit because we didn't have it on the books for anything, but it is a fill product. And if you're looking at what was a fairly significant movement on base, particularly in that Raleigh market, Of all the things that I worry at night about, aggregate pricing is not on my list.  Those -- purely simply those are the drivers. The other thing and I know your question were on organic, but I do think it's important to keep in mind when you look at it all rolled up. Stone pricing in the acquired Tiller operations are about $5 a ton lower than our Heritage number. So again, when you do an all-in number with that, it's clearly has optically a dilutive effect. And then when you feather in nearly a million tons of funds, again, it will have an optical effect. But I think to your point, the mid-years, I think really did underscore the strength of the market. And to give you a sense of what we saw in the East Division, this really means in the Carolinas, was a bucket ton up on clean stone effective July 1 and even $0.50 on base effective July 1. And then Southwest, we saw in North Texas up $0.50 to $0.75 a ton on September 1.  In Austin, up a bucket ton and in Hunter Stone, which is in New Braunfels, $0.50 to up a bucket ton, and then in Garwood up a bucket ton on August 1. So, I think all those at least in the way that I'm watching it and measuring the cadence, David, gives me a high degree of confidence in what we're anticipating next year that and probably more importantly together with conversations we've had with our customers. So, I hope that helps. Yes, it would. No, not really. The only thing that I would say is probably consistent this time is whenever you do a midyear, you're only going to actually see a very limited portion of those go in the year and what inputs you put it. I mean, historically, what I would've said, if you did a mid-year truly on July 1 or June 30, if you got 20% or 25% of it in the year in which you put it in, you'd be fortunate. So really, it's more of a play into the following year. Thanks, David. Shana (ph) thank you so much and thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. To conclude our strong third quarter results underpinned by our record-setting safety, operational and financial performance, reinforce our confidence in Martin Marietta's opportunities to soar to a sustainable future and maximize stakeholder value. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full-year 2021 results in February as always, we're available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy. Good bye."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. Both the building materials and Magnesia Specialties businesses contributed to our double-digit growth in product revenues and increased profitability. That said, increase energy expense continues as a headwind, temporarily pressuring margins. For the third quarter alone, total energy costs increased $28 million or nearly 50% Company-wide, as compared with last year. Absent this headwind, our consolidate adjusted gross margin would have outpaced the record set in the prior-year quarter.  Aggregate's product gross margin of 34.2% included higher diesel and other production costs, as well as a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding the acquisition impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.9%, a 150-basis point decline versus prior year. Cement product gross margin declined 250 basis points driven by higher raw material cost and a $6 million increase in natural gas and electricity cost.  Ready-mix concrete product gross margin improved modestly to nearly 10% as shipment and pricing gains offset higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $72 million, a 30% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth more than offset higher costs for energy and contract services, driving a 100-basis points improvement in product gross margin to 39%.  As part of our longstanding capital allocation priorities, we continue to balance value enhancing acquisitions with prudent capital spending, and returning cash to shareholders while preserving a healthy Balance Sheet, financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. Consistent with SOAR 2025, we acquired a crushed concrete aggregates producer in the Houston area in late July. These acquired aggregates operations expand our customer base and product offerings and one of the nation's largest addressable markets. We have raised our full-year capital spending guidance to $475 million to $525 million to include anticipated Lehigh West Region 's capital expenditures.  We continue to prioritize high return capital projects, focus on growing sales, and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Additionally, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, underscoring its confidence in our future performance, and a resilient, and growing free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.44. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividend, as well as share repurchases.  In early July, we issued $2.5 billion of Senior Notes with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.2% and a weighted-average tenure of 15 years, primarily to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times as of September 30. Leverage on a pro form basis, inclusive of recent acquisitions, is modestly above 3 times debt-to-EBITDA. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 to 2.5 times within the next 18 months.  As detailed in today's release, we've updated our full-year 2021 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results that factor in higher energy costs and the fourth-quarter contribution from the newly acquired Lehigh West Business. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1 billion, $500 million to $1 billion, $550 million dollars. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. Yeah. Sure. So, Courtney, so what we're really talking about is our old guidance to our updated guidance, right? So, what had happened there was we had a more downtime than we had planned on due some maintenance. So, there's $3 million more of higher maintenance. But the bigger effect for the year was the draw - down inventories. So, we had record shipments as you heard on our prepared remarks. The record shipments -- but our production levels were below what we had expected.  And so, when you have that situation, we have inventory draw - down into -- our fixed cost absorption was worse than we had forecast and that's the biggest piece of that headwinds for guidance. And then separately, of course, energy headwinds are elevated higher than we had forecasted previously, These are non-diesel headwinds so nat -gas, as Ward mentioned earlier, electricity, and to a much lesser extent, coal, All those costs were higher. Our view of it now is higher cost than our view of that 3 months ago. So, those were the real drivers of that. Did I answer your question, Courtney? Yes. So, we're -- we -- last quarter, our view for diesel was right. So, we're spot on Q3, Q4 versus forecast diesel costs we -- we're still comfortable at the currently forecast levels. What we're surprised by was the non-diesel energy costs in Q3 and the forecasts now reflects that. So, I'd say it's up roughly depending on the fuel type, 35% to 60% year-over-year so that's what's now in our forecast. So that's in our new forecasts and we don't expect that to get worse at this point. Of course, we could be wrong and if we are wrong, the way to cure that is through midyear price increases down the road. That's right. You've got it exactly right, Paul. That is -- the amount -- that mass amount that we increased it in a new guidance versus the old guidance is due to the acquired assets Lehigh Hanson West. No, I think you've nailed it. It should be in line with what you've seen historically from us, our CapEx spend in total. So as our sales grow, including Lehigh Hanson business, our CapEx will grow commensurately. So, there should be no -- nothing unusual versus past history. Around 9% of sales is probably a good starting point to think about [Indiscernible] CapEx for us. For the guidance, it was about $10 million for the old guidance to new guidance. Yeah. Good morning."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities Laws in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. We\u2019ve made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q2 2021 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. In addition, any non-GAAP measures discussed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Ward Nye will begin today\u2019s earnings call with a discussion of our second quarter operating performance and market trends as well as our recently announced acquisition. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results after which Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne and thank you all for joining today\u2019s teleconference. Martin Marietta has once again reported impressive results extending our strong track record of industry-leading performance and responsible growth. We delivered record profitability and the best safety performance in our company\u2019s history to the first half of the year. We\u2019re also making notable progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further enhance our ability to capitalize on growing construction activity and favorable pricing dynamics in the post-pandemic landscape. We\u2019re confident about Martin Marietta\u2019s prospects for the remainder of 2021. In May, we announced an agreement to acquire Lehigh Hanson\u2019s West Region. Those of you who joined us early this year for our Investor Day, we\u2019re likely not surprised when you read the announcement. The acquisition, which is consistent with and advances SOAR 2025 provides a new upstream materials led platform in three of the Western United States largest and fastest growing mega regions. With this leading Pacific presence will be well positioned to capitalize on long-term demand drivers from increased state infrastructure investment in California and Arizona, as well as continued private sector growth across these regions. This strategic acquisition also provides Martin Marietta with an enhanced coast-to-coast geographic footprint and serves as a viable platform for potential continued geographic expansion. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2021 following customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Lehigh West Region team to Martin Marietta. We\u2019re also very pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Tiller operations in the Minneapolis St. Paul region, which exceeded management\u2019s initial expectations since closing on April 30. Tiller contributed one million tons each of aggregates and asphalt during May and June, and provides Martin Marietta, an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest growing Midwestern metropolitan areas, while also expanding and complementing our product offerings in our existing operations and surrounding markets. Integration into our central division is underway and synergy realization is progressing as planned. This business remains on track to contribute $60 million of adjusted EBITDA this year. Martin Marietta has established a long track record of superior value creation by prudently balancing inorganic growth opportunities, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Our latest acquisitions and successful growth initiatives demonstrate that SOAR and our discipline capital deployment strategy continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders, positioning our company for sustainable long-term operational and financial success. Now let\u2019s turn to the company\u2019s second quarter performance. We achieved record second quarter revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share, driven by strengthening product demand, pricing gains across all product lines, and meaningful contributions from the recently acquired Tiller acquisition. On a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 9% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% to $393 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $439 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $3.81. Our Building Materials business continued to benefit from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment, and heavy industrial projects of scale. Adverse weather however, muted shipments, most notably in our top two revenue generating states are aggregates cement, and ready-mixed concrete operations in Texas, experienced lower than expected shipment levels as a result of excessive rainfall. In fact, the second quarter was Texas\u2019s 11th wettest on record. Additionally, Colorado home to our Front Range aggregates and downstream operations surpassed average annual precipitation levels during the first half of the year. Second quarter aggregate shipments increased 1.5% on an organic basis and 3% in total. East Group total shipments grew 7% strong demand across all end use markets in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland combined with shipments from the acquired Tiller operations, more than offset lower shipments in the Midwest from weather induced project delays. West Group shipments declined nearly 4% as Mother Nature interrupted otherwise robust construction activity in both Texas and Colorado. Organic aggregates average selling price increased over 3% supported by our value over volume pricing strategy led by the East Group. Geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher priced long-haul shipments limited West Group\u2019s reported pricing gains on a mix adjusted basis, West Group pricing increased 2.4%. We announced mid-year price increases in a number of markets, which should further contribute to favorable pricing trends heading into next year. Our Texas Cement business delivered solid operating performance, despite significant precipitation that disrupted more than one-third of the quarter\u2019s available shipping days. Second quarter shipments declined less than 2%. As major projects in South Texas, along with recovering energy sector activity helped mitigate weather impacts. Notably, we established an all time record for monthly cement shipments in June, largely due to the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Second quarter cement pricing increased 7% or 4% on a mix adjusted basis, as annual increases went into effect on April 1. Additionally, we\u2019ve announced the second price increase of $8 per ton on September 1 for both North and South Texas. This represents the first midyear increase since 2014. Attractive demand drivers continued market tightness, and diversified customer backlogs will support sustainable construction activity and pricing for our Texas Cement operations over the next several years. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mixed concrete shipments increased to 8% despite significant weather headwinds driven by incremental volume from large non-residential projects and operations acquired last year in Texas. Concrete pricing increased modestly reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower priced Texas shipments. Overall asphalt shipments increased 68% driven by contributions from the Tiller operations, which more than offset weather related shipment declines in our Colorado asphalt and paving business. Colorado market fundamentals remain strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta is attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long term secular demand trends across our three primary end-used markets will drive increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2021 and into the future. Demand for our construction products has grown. And we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contractor labor and supply shortages compounded by weather differ days that become increasingly difficult to recover is the year advances can govern the near term pace of overall construction activity. Fortunately, we expect work not completed this year to simply be pushed into 2022 and foresee bottlenecks like these moderating and throughput improving as federal unemployment benefits expire in September. We\u2019re also in the midst of the most significant seemingly bipartisan national infrastructure debate in a long time, with a number of proposals from both political parties to advance and address much needed investment. Regardless of the pathway to success or infrastructure legislation all proposals provide for sizeable increases in federal surface transportation funding over the fixing America\u2019s surface transportation, or FAST Act. We\u2019re optimistic that meaningful progress in Washington DC will be made and a FAST Act replacement will be passed before its expiration in September. Such legislation would immediately stimulate economic growth, contractor optimism and job creation, while also driving meaningful product demand starting in late 2022 and beyond. Our company\u2019s top five States Department of Transportation or DOTs are well positioned to put increased transportation dollars to work more specifically, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 building materials revenues have an abundance of projects in their backlog that would benefit from higher federal funding and generate growing demand for our products. At the same time, increased visibility and funding certainty of the federal level supports a healthy pricing environment for construction materials. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of second quarter shipments well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. Non-residential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We\u2019re also beginning to see early signs of recovery in the more COVID-19 impacted wide commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Denver, Atlanta, and the Texas triangle. Light non-residential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022 given the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 36% of second quarter shipments. Martin Marietta continues to be a beneficiary of single-family housing growth across the southeast and southwest. Single-family starch remains strong despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times supported by significant under building over the past decade, low mortgage rates and accelerated the urbanization trends. Importantly, single-family housing is two to three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of second quarter shipments. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically, our second quarter financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas : Thanks, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The Building Materials business posted products and services revenues of $1.2 billion a 7% increase from last year\u2019s second quarter and product gross profit of $357 million. Aggregates established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit, higher diesel costs and a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting are reflected in product gross margin of 34%. Excluding the acquisition impact adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.8% a 70 basis point decline versus prior year. In addition, gross profit per ton shipped, improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. So net product gross margin declined 870 basis points despite top-line growth, driven by the timing and scope of planned kill maintenance, as well as higher energy and raw material costs. While our first half results were impacted by some weather related headwinds, our cement business is well positioned benefit from a growing demand and tight supply. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin declined 350 basis points to 7%, a shipment and pricing gains were offset the higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million a 43% increase, revenue growth more than offset higher energy costs for energy and contract services, driving a 260 basis point improvement in product gross margin to 39.9%. On a consolidated basis, earnings from operations included more than $9 million of acquisition related costs, as well as a $12 million gain on the sale of property. This gain is non-recurring in nature and should not be extrapolated for run rate purposes. Relative to often cited broader economic questions regarding supply chain and inflation. We are pleased that our overall supply chain remains resilient with only a handful of indications of strain for some suppliers. On the cost inflation front, the only notable headwinds we have seen are from increased energy costs. For the second quarter alone, our total energy costs increased $24 million companywide. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted margins would have outpaced prior year, a testament to our team\u2019s commitment to cost control and operational excellence. We remain focused on the discipline execution of our proven strategy and our long standing capital allocation priorities that preserve our healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment grade credit rating profile. As Ward noted, we continue to balance value enhancing inorganic growth opportunities with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. To that end, we have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $450 million to $500 million as you prioritize high return capital projects focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends, as well as share repurchases. As of June 30, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times. In late June, we access the capital markets to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction issuing $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and weighted average tenure of 15 years. The bond sale settled in early July, and as such is not reflected in our second quarter results. We expect pro forma leverage at year end to be above our target range. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt, following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times within 18 months following the closing of the transaction. As detailed in today\u2019s release, we\u2019ve updated our full year guidance to reflect current expectations, the completion of the Tiller acquisition and the $2.5 billion bond offering. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.465 billion to $1.535 billion. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we\u2019re proud of our record first half results and industry-leading safety performance and remain highly confident in our outlook for the balance of 2021. Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends that are expected to support sustainable construction activity, both in the near and long-term. As we soar to a sustainable future, our focus remains on building the safest, best performing and most sustainable aggregates lead public company, thanks to our disciplined execution of SOAR, commitment to safe and efficient operations and our dedication to both commercial and operational excellence. Today Martin Marietta is superbly positioned. We\u2019re confident in Martin Marietta\u2019s ability to deliver sustainable growth and superior shareholder value in 2021 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nStanley Elliott: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Ward, you mentioned the strong pricing environment on the summit side in the $8 increase yield coming in September. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing on the aggregate side as well, and then also some of the downstream businesses?\nWard Nye: No, happy too, Stanley. Good morning and nice to hear your voice. So, you\u2019re right September one is going to be an important date in cement. We\u2019re taking that pricing up as you indicated $8 a ton. But as we also indicated during it when we were at the end of the first quarter, we thought we would see more mid-year price increases than we\u2019ve seen in years past. That\u2019s entirely what\u2019s happening. If we\u2019re looking on the aggregate side first and look at our East Division, we\u2019re looking in a number of places for $1 a ton on clean stone, $0.50 a ton on based on all effective July 1. So that\u2019s something that that we put into effect. But equally, we\u2019re looking at aggregate price increases mid-year in the southwest division. So for example, in North Texas, and for purposes of this read Dallas-Fort Worth, we\u2019re looking at $0.50 to $0.75 of time on September 1. In Austin, we\u2019re looking more at $1 a ton on August 1. At Hunter Stone, which was one of those sound centers Houston TX, where we have the quarry in conjunction with a cement plant in New Braunfels. We\u2019re looking $0.50 to $1 a ton on August 1 and a Garwood down just outside Houston, Sand Gravel facility looking at $1 a ton there. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing on the stone side of it. Now equally, and I think this is important, Stanley. We\u2019re looking for that also in readymix, particularly in Texas. So, we\u2019re looking for ranges anywhere from $4, a cubic yard in Austin, and in East Texas, up to $6 a cubic yard in North Texas. So, if we think about what we\u2019re seeing in mid years, we\u2019re seeing it in aggregates, we\u2019re seeing it in the east, we\u2019re seeing it in the southwest. We\u2019re seeing it in cement and our uniquely Texas business today. And we\u2019re also seeing in readymix in Texas. So again, the type of backdrop that we anticipated, we will see Stanley I\u2019m happy to report that to you.\nStanley Elliott: That\u2019s great. And secondly, could you talk a little bit more about the inflation side that you saw in the summit? My guess is some of the maintenance is not a whole lot last year and kind of a normal cadence this year, but any other thing to call out? And then I guess one other thing, any update on the additional grinding capacity or expansion that you all had thought about earlier in the year there?\nWard Nye: Yes. So what I\u2019ll say relative to the grinding capacity again, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re finishing that we\u2019ll be adding to Midlothian. So you\u2019ll hear more about that as we go into 2022. Again, that\u2019s a market that we believe simply needs that. With respect to the maintenance in cement, you\u2019re exactly right, if you think back to 2020. Part of what we indicated coming into 2021 is that we would spend more in cement maintenance. In fact, we had indicated to the market early on, that we thought we would spend about $6 million more on kiln and finish mill outages in 2021 than we did in 2020. And really Q2 was the time to do that. So if you\u2019re looking at the delta, on what we did last year in Q2, and what we did this year in Q2, on cement maintenance, it was about $7.3 million difference. So, we spent that much more in Q2 than we did last year. So in other words, that full annual difference that we had anticipated that you should expect. We pretty much did that in Q2. So what we\u2019re expecting is a very comparable smooth run here in the second half of the year. And frankly, we\u2019re expecting better margins in that business in the second half of the year as a consequence.\nStanley Elliott: Perfect. Thank you all for the time. Best of luck.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Stanley.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is now open.\nKathryn Thompson: Thank you for taking my question today. It\u2019s a little bit into the previous question. Could you provide a stair step in terms of the guidance update in terms of puts and takes in terms of good guys bad guys? And then layering and on the price increases? What would have margins then excluding some of the costs from energy that you outlined? And how do these margins really play into the back half of the year and really into 2022 from a margin profile? Thank you.\nWard Nye: No, you bet Kathryn. So several things. Let\u2019s talk about the margin piece at first, because as Jim indicated, in his commentary and there was prepared, energy was up $24 million for the quarter. So I mean, that\u2019s a big number. And if we look at diesel fuel all by itself that was up almost $15 million. So, if we go and look at our diesel fuel usage that was a little bit over 12 and million gallons, excuse me a diesel fuel up about $1.11 per gallon. So if we go and pull that energy piece of it out and look at the margins, actually, what you\u2019ll see on the margins across the enterprise is that adjusted gross margins actually improved over Q2, 2020. What that tells me, Kathryn is the underlying performance of the cost side of the business is actually doing extraordinarily well. So, what I\u2019m pleased with is the underlying cost is doing well. And we\u2019re seeing the price move forward in a way that we thought that we would particularly as the economy continues to improve. Now, with respect to your question on guidance, in particular, you\u2019re right, some had some things moving around one, we did just drop in what we had indicated verbally before, and that was we expect $60 million of EBITDA contribution from the acquired Tiller operations. Equally, if we\u2019re looking at our cement business that has noted for intended, whether the deep freeze in Texas in February and then as we indicated an extraordinarily wet Q2. We\u2019ve taken cement down a little bit and of course, readymix is going to follow that so we pulled that down a little bit. And asphalt and paving in Colorado had a very challenging year-over-year or so we pulled those down. But we\u2019ve equally taken Magnesia Specialties, backup. So those are some of the broader puts and takes that we have, if we look overall at the pricing, we\u2019ve really not changed price. And we\u2019ve kept that very consistent with where we thought, keep in mind the mid years that we\u2019re putting in will not affect pricing that much this year is setting the stage even more robustly for 2022. And we did pull aggregate volume down just a hair in large measure. We\u2019re just looking at the days left in the year. It\u2019s not an indication of any lack of robustness in the market. At some point, today\u2019s just get shorter. So Kathryn, I hope that answers your series of questions.\nKathryn Thompson: It does. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the lines of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJatin Khanna: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Jatin Khanna on behalf of Jerry Revich. Our questions around aggregate pricing, the midpoint of heritage pricing guidance implies about 5% organic pricing in the second half, was about 3% in the first half is that the extent to which you expect pricing to accelerate based on media prices increases? And also, what would have had to happen to hit the high end of the guidance range. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. One, if we think about volume guidance in the second half, whether it\u2019s implying is basically about a 4% increase in volume in the second half. And you\u2019re right, what we\u2019re anticipating is we\u2019re going to see some accelerating pricing. A number of the things that we seen during the first half of the year that I think is important is we\u2019ve seen considerably more bass work than we have before. I think that\u2019s actually good, because as you may recall, base work ends up turning into finished work on top of that. So you\u2019re going to see several things. One, we believe North Carolina, Georgia, and the East will continue to perform actually quite well. If you\u2019re looking overall at the volume. And again, the volume is going to have some degree of impact on ASP if you think about geographic mix. The East Group in the first half was up 7%, excluding, Tiller, it was up 4%. But it\u2019s important to note that Tiller\u2019s pricing is about 30%, lower than heritage, Martin Marietta. So that actually gave us a modest headwind. So if we\u2019re looking at what I think will be more clean stone sales most likely in the second half of the year have continued good performance in the East. And in some instances, we were selling some products that were in reserve. And typically those tend to go for a relatively lower average selling price. I think it does back in triangulating around the number that you had indicated. And yes, we continue to have good confidence around that in the back half of the year.\nJatin Khanna: Thank you very much.\nWard Nye: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTrey Grooms: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, if you look at, the guidance again, digging into that just a little bit more. You talked about the energy costs that were obviously present, probably not going to change any talked about some pricing, obviously that follows that you guys are putting in place. Ward you also mentioned that it will be probably more next year before this pricing really starts to impact, so as we look at the back half, your margins were impacted in 2Q. But I think Kathryn asked the question earlier, but maybe a little bit different angle on the back half margins as we looked through the balance of the year. How are we looking at, the price versus some of these energy impacts that you\u2019re seeing, and then how that flows through relative to what we saw in the 2Q?\nWard Nye: Well, I think you clearly will get some benefit from mid years in the second half. Now, the fact is, most of that, as we discussed, rate is going to play more into next year. I think the other thing that we saw a bit in the first half is we did see a bit more maintenance and repair. And some of that was tied in to the acquisition activity as well. So we think that\u2019s going to moderate itself. So I think that\u2019s clearly going to come back and help on the margin piece of it. I think the other thing is, if we simply look at what was happening in Texas, and in Colorado, it\u2019s difficult to be as efficient as you want to be when you\u2019re dealing with those high degrees of rainfall as well. So we\u2019re entering a period of time that typically is drier, we\u2019re entering a period of time that some of the mid years will play in, we\u2019re entering a period of time where I think we\u2019re going to see more clean stone going relative to base. And I think we\u2019re entering a period of time, that you\u2019re likely to see less maintenance and repair because in many respects, people are simply blowing and going in Q3. So, I think you take that combination of factors, I think it comes back and addresses some of the margin questions I\u2019ll turn to my colleague, Mr. Nickolas, and he has anything he wants to add to that, Trey.\nJim Nickolas: Sure. Thanks Trey, happy too. One notable thing and energy is our own guidance committee new guidance, we\u2019ve increased energy expense by $34 million. And despite that, your margin question our incremental for the year, once the year is all said and done, we\u2019re expecting 50% incremental margins, still the accurate side despite that heavier energy expense. So by and large, we\u2019re very happy with where things are ending up. And just to put in perspective, 2021 to energy expense and diesel, while higher versus last year, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we saw in 2019. So for us, this is not much of a stretch to kind of keep putting and good margins in.\nTrey Grooms: Great got, and thanks for clarifying some of that stuff. That was just some questions that getting in the weeds was definitely helpful. Thank you. And then if I could sneak one in just on the big picture, because you did mention it on the bipartisan bill. I mean, this is kind of surprising, I think, to some that we\u2019re seeing the folks in Washington actually, look like there may be coming together on something here. But, just a given kind of where they\u2019ve outlined funds for street and highway and bridge, and other things. Which I think the bridge piece might have been taken up a little bit. But I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on this version of the bill Ward, and maybe what it could mean longer term for Martin Marietta?\nWard Nye: Look, thanks for the question very much on that. And obviously, we\u2019re all watching what happened in the Senate last night? I guess the good news is I\u2019m not sure that here we were that surprised by so look, based on the way that we see it. It\u2019s that overall proposal, trillion dollars, five years $550 billion in new spending. And really, if we\u2019re looking at roads and bridges Trey, that\u2019s going to be by our math, about $110 billion, that\u2019s going to be around $39 billion for public transport, another $66 billion for rail, and keep in mind with the largest balance producer in the country, $25 billion for airports and about $17 billion for ports. So, I mean, that\u2019s going to be a lot of work. What does that mean? Overall? I think it means several things. One, its recognition that it\u2019s overdue. Number two, it\u2019s a recognition that at least from our perspective, Trey, and you heard in prepared remarks. Having watched this business for a long time in this industry for a long time, typically 40 some percent of our products is finding its way to highways, bridges, roads and streets. And we\u2019ve been in the 30s for the last several years. And that\u2019s really evidence of the fact that there\u2019s not been the level of investment at the federal level that was needed. So if we\u2019re looking simply the senate bipartisan plan, and we\u2019re looking at what that means from a percentage up from baseline, FY 2021 appropriations and invest, it\u2019s up about 46% from the baseline. So this is not a trifling number. And what I really liked about it, too, is if you look at the vote last night on basically the closure motion, what you\u2019re going to find is 67 senators voted for this, and among them was Mitch Mcconnell. And so when we start looking at where Senate leadership is, and who really came along to move that vote along, it was some pretty notable players. And the other thing that I think is important is obviously the pay for us are going to matter. And this and when we look at the pay for us at least, how they\u2019ve been pulled together in the senate version, you\u2019ve got a lot of repurpose, COVID relief that\u2019s going into this. You\u2019ve got some unused unemployment insurance that\u2019s going into it. And then obviously, they\u2019re going to be looking at it degrees of economic growth that\u2019s going to be derived from the program\u2019s investment. In other words, dynamic scoring, that\u2019s also going to be a piece of it. So the fact that it got that degree of a vote that it got that type of support from senators [indiscernible] Senator Portman is an McConnell. We think it\u2019s important and we think it helps put the industry in attractive place, not just from an infrastructure perspective going forward. But we believe residential is going to remain strong. We think heavy non-res is going to remain strong, and we think res is going to inflect. That light portion of non-res. Long story short, we think this bill, if it\u2019s pushed forward into law, and we believe it will be before the FAST Act expires, puts the industry in a very attractive place for a multiyear run trend.\nTrey Grooms: That\u2019s great color. Thanks for the thoughts there Ward and take care. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nPhil Ng: Hey, good morning, everyone. Ward this second round of price increase, you called out for aggregates in the East in Texas, I believe. Anyway, to kind of put that into context. What\u2019s driving that is that more tightness in supply, demand versus inflation. And if it\u2019s more tight market conditions, we want to get a little flavor, and how broad basis this potentially as we kind of look out to next year? And if that\u2019s the framework, should we expect, noticeable step up from, the 3% to 5% pricing we\u2019ve seen in the last few years?\nWard Nye: Phil, that\u2019s a great question. And I would submit to you it\u2019s not so much driven by tightness right now. I think it\u2019s driven more by what is anticipated; I think is driven by a much higher degree of confidence. If we\u2019re looking at the condition of most DOTs in the East States, DOTS are actually in a very, very good place. For example, if we look at where North Carolina Department Transportation is, I mean, their financial issues are very much in the past with 22 lettings a $2.7 billion. That\u2019s up. I mean, if you can imagine 260% from the prior year. So if we\u2019re looking at what\u2019s happening relative to homebuilding in these markets, if we\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with respect to infrastructure, if we\u2019re looking at a very healthy non-res environment as well in the East, it all looks very, very attractive, whether that\u2019s going to be in North Carolina, or Georgia or South Carolina or Florida as well. The other thing that I think is really telling is when we pause and take a look at the backlogs and backlogs are always something funny in this industry because it\u2019s a practical matter. They usually represent only around 25% or 35% of annual aggregates and cement going forward. But it does give you a good dipstick into the tank to get a sense of where things are. And total aggregates backlogs is pretty attractive. It\u2019s around 13% ahead a prior year levels. So again, if we\u2019re going back to the notion of overall contractor competence, if we\u2019re looking at it, people who are going to be busy and they know they\u2019re going to be busy, and then seeing broadly an overall inflationary market in a lot of different respects. It\u2019s actually a very appropriate and opportune moment for us to make sure that we\u2019re getting the value for a spec material that not everybody can put on the ground.\nPhil Ng: That\u2019s super helpful. And sorry to sneak one in. You mentioned you\u2019re starting to see some improvement in like commercial any color on how trends have progressed the last few quarters are you starting to see shipments flattened out a little bit. Any color on the bidding activity be helpful as well.\nWard Nye: Though, we that\u2019s a great point, we clearly are starting to see better activity on white non-res I mean, If we\u2019re looking Colorado, I mean, clearly office retail and hospitality is looking for a stronger inflection in half, two, if we\u2019re looking here in our backyard in North Carolina, it\u2019s been fairly fascinating to watch I mean retail and hospitality are both already beginning to inflect. And we\u2019re starting to see strong corporate reloads here. Population trends are following that. We\u2019ve got Apple and Google making significant investments here. And again, as we\u2019re looking at markets like Florida, office, hotel, retail, and industrial activity in that marketplace actually continues to really be quite strong. A lot of what\u2019s driving it and look we get. The U.S. is added since 2000, over 48 million people in population. And what that\u2019s doing is it\u2019s driving, what we\u2019re seeing now in single family housing and then single family housing is driving what we\u2019re starting to see but basically the way that we thought we would during analyst Investor Day, here is we go into half to fill. So I hope that helps.\nPhil Ng: Yes, super up. Good luck on the quarter, guys.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Your line is now open.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think you mentioned that Tiller is the first couple months of ownership outperforming your expectations and just kind of curious as to what\u2019s driving that. And then also, if I heard your right, you said Tiller pricing is about four points below the corporate average. So can you speak to perhaps the commercial synergy opportunity there?\nWard Nye: No happy to number one, we\u2019re thrilled to have Tiller as part of this organization, culturally and otherwise they have wonderfully for us, you\u2019ve heard what I said in the prepared remarks. Basically, in May and June, they sold a million tons of aggregates and a million tons of hot mix. By the way, I think their history that\u2019s the fastest they\u2019ve ever gotten to that million tons in hot mix. I think what you\u2019re seeing is several things one, the Minneapolis St. Paul market is a good healthy Midwest market, it tends to be very steady. We\u2019re seeing good activity there. We talked before about the fact that Minneapolis St. Paul actually consumes more tons of aggregates in hot mix on a per annum basis, than even Charlotte does, which is a premier market here. So again, I think from a timing perspective, and from a market perspective, and putting their business together with ours, in that important market to us, the timing was good, the operational synergies are going to be real. We have a lot that we can learn from each other there. Tiller is extraordinarily good. On the asphalt side, they are already teaching us things that we can take from that. I think we can help them on the aggregate side. But I will tell you, they are very good on the aggregate side. So again, if we\u2019re looking at margins in that business, they tend to start with a three. So again, I think everything that we were hoping that we would see in that transaction is come through. Yes, the other thing that\u2019s happening too is they have some very attractive real estate that they\u2019ve been able to sell, we\u2019ve been able to sell. That actually takes the overall purchase price paid for the business and pulls it down, actually very nicely. So, I\u2019m happy to report to you, Garik, there\u2019s nothing about that transaction, that as you might be able to glean from my commentary that we\u2019re not gushing about right now. So, we\u2019re very pleased with it, and think they\u2019re great things to come.\nGarik Shmois: Great. Thanks again.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Garik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Hi, good morning, gentlemen.\nWard Nye: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Dudas: Maybe you share some thoughts on a very good performance on Specialties Magnesia. Pretty impressive at times it appears like in the U.S. steel market and certainly demand for the products and chemicals going around the world. What are your managers \u2013 are they \u2013 is there some sustainability to this very cyclical? Is there going to be maybe more of a sustainable aspect to what the business could be like and maybe looking in next couple years out? Or is it just a cyclical pop here that the markets will dictate a little bit even though we\u2019re having some strong tightness in those downstream markets?\nWard Nye: Number one, thanks for the question. Because that\u2019s an extraordinary business, it does not get the airtime that it is earned and it deserves. So, what I would say is several things, what you\u2019re seeing in the business this quarter isn\u2019t so much an unusual pop. This is more like returning to usual for that business. So, if we think about what was happening globally, last year, this time, steel was in a very challenging place. Overseas chemicals was in a challenging place, because in many respects, markets were closed. So, if we go back to June of 2020, steel was running at about 55% capacity, today it\u2019s running at around 83%. So that\u2019s a good healthy number. Everything that we\u2019re seeing in that market tells us that we expect that business to run strong and remain strong, certainly for the rest of this year. The other thing that we\u2019re seeing is cobalt. And that ends up being an important market for us overseas is up 52% since the end of 2020. So, when we\u2019re looking at how the business is performing on steel, where it\u2019s performing relative to its chemicals business all that\u2019s really quite good. And here\u2019s what\u2019s even more impressive, because if you keep in mind, energy has actually been going up during much of this year. Keep in mind that is a large count driven business in portions of it, both in Woodville and in Manistee. And typically as nat gas goes, it can have a profound effect, why not have profound effects a notable effect on the way that business is operating. And basically what we\u2019re seeing is their ability to manage their costs extraordinarily well. They continue to get good pricing. And we believe that business back to the essence of your question is in fact very, very durable, Mike. So, we expect continued great things from Mag Specialties. But again, thank you for the question.\nMichael Dudas: No, that\u2019s excellent. Well said, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\nJoe Nolan: Hi, this is Joe Nolan on for David MacGregor. I\u2019m actually going to give Magnesia Specialties a little more airtime here. Just wondering about capacity availability in that business, just wondering if you\u2019re approaching constraints and if so you have any intention to invest in growth of new capacity? Or would you rather pursue de-bottlenecking increments just any details there?\nWard Nye: Yes, that\u2019s a great question. And there can\u2019t be enough Magnesia Specialties loss. So thank you for brought to the question. That is the business that in many respects is running at capacity right now. And we\u2019ve recognized that so much of what that business is doing is several folds. One is looking for ways to de-bottleneck and run things more efficiently. Number two, it continues to look at its product mix, and will continue to drive more of what it\u2019s doing to its higher margin products. They\u2019ve had a great history of doing that. I\u2019m sure they have a very bright future of doing that as well. Part of that so difficult about that business, and it\u2019s one of the great things about the business is we produce 24% of the dolomitic lime in North America from our facility at Woodville and opening permitting and otherwise, the dolomitic lime plant is very costly, it is very time consuming. Both our facilities in Manistee and in Woodville have title five operating permits, they operate very, very efficiently. So adding more capacity is something that it\u2019s very difficult, we\u2019re always looking for responsible ways to grow the business. But I think in the near term, what you can anticipate is de-bottlenecking, focusing on higher margin products. And at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be focused on pricing in that business just as we are in the aggregates in cement business. So Joe, I hope that helps.\nJoe Nolan: Very helpful. Thanks. And if I could just sneak another quick one in on North Carolina, if you could just talk about the growth you\u2019re seeing in that market and how much of that may be state spending versus private sector construction and also just the extent to which you feel that pattern will continue in 2022? Thanks.\nWard Nye: Yes, no, happy too. As I\u2019ve indicated our FY 2022 learning\u2019s just looking at NCDOT for a second are increasing 260%. So I mean, clearly, DOT in a much different, very healthy place right now. Keep in mind, that\u2019s an overall DOT with an annual budget around $5 billion. So that\u2019s on the public side. If we look on the non-res, I would say several things. If you think about North Carolina really working from the middle of the state to a little bit farther west, you end up in Raleigh Durham. Then you farther west of Greensboro, high point Winston Salem into Charlotte, all markets in which we have leading positions. So, if I think about what\u2019s going on in Charlotte, for example, from a non-res perspective, Charlotte continues to be a significant beneficiary of a lot of warehousing activity. You\u2019ve got I-77, I-85, and a host of large thoroughfares that are coming together in what\u2019s effectively the capital of the Carolinas, if you think about it. What\u2019s important too is in places like Greensboro in the Triad again, we\u2019re seeing good warehouse and we\u2019re seeing good medical and surprisingly healthy retail activity there. But here\u2019s part of what I think is driving that. So for example, D.R. Horton recently announced their plans to build a 1000 homes subdivision in Greensboro. What I\u2019m going to suggest to you Joe, if you go back in time and listen to the last time I was talking about somebody building 1000 homes subdivision in the Triad, it\u2019s been a while. So the fact is, if you\u2019re seeing that type of single-family housing growth in the Triad, you\u2019re going to continue to see good non-res activity. And I spoke just a few minutes ago about what\u2019s happening here in the Raleigh Durham area, with Apple with Google with generally what\u2019s happening in the Research Triangle Park. And keep in mind, when you\u2019ve got North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill and Duke University in Durham, you\u2019ve got three large universities that tend to drive a lot of economic activity, and you got state government here. And so this is an area that in good times does extraordinarily well, in more challenging times. You\u2019re not going to say it\u2019s recession proof, but it\u2019s pretty close. So those are the types of things that we\u2019re seeing in North Carolina, Joe.\nJoe Nolan: Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nWard Nye: Thank you. Take care of rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Wilson from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nJosh Wilson: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWard Nye: You bet, Josh. \nJosh Wilson: Wanted to clarify the pricing commentary that you gave in aggregates are those mid-year price increases include in the guidance or a potential source of upside, depending on how quickly they gain traction?\nWard Nye: Well, we\u2019ve done our best to make those and as a practical matter of what you\u2019re doing, Josh is you are protecting people who already have prices from you, as a general rule, what I would tell you is you\u2019re going to recognize about 25% of a mid-year price increase, if in fact, you\u2019re putting them in at mid-year in the year that they\u2019re baked in. So that\u2019s how I\u2019ve asked you to think about those, in many respects, the mid-years that I outlined for you on aggregates, at least in the East were effective on July 1. Now, keep in mind, when I went through those different portions of the Southwest, most of those were effective on August 1, somewhere effective September 1. So we\u2019ve done our best to bake that into what we have, but it can be a little bit elusive at times.\nJosh Wilson: And just to sneak one other in on summit, there\u2019s no maintenance differences in the rest of the year, then either good or bad?\nWard Nye: The balance of the year ought to be a pretty smooth run, because as I think I indicate in conversation with Stanley. We had indicated there was going to be a vast $6 million delta more in 2021 than there was in 2020. And again, we had outlined the fact that in Q2, the maintenance costs were up about $7.3 million.\nJosh Wilson: Thanks, good luck with the next one.\nWard Nye: All right, very good. Thank you so much. Take care, Josh.\nWard Nye: And again, thank you all for joining today\u2019s earnings call. We\u2019ll continue to focus on maximizing value for shareholders as we build on our strong results and continue executing on our SOAR 2025 plan. We look forward to sharing our third quarter of 2021 results in a few months. As always, we\u2019re available for any follow up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and your continued support Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy. We\u2019ll speak to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta has once again reported impressive results extending our strong track record of industry-leading performance and responsible growth. We delivered record profitability and the best safety performance in our company's history to the first half of the year. We're also making notable progress on our SOAR 2025 initiatives to further enhance our ability to capitalize on growing construction activity and favorable pricing dynamics in the post-pandemic landscape. We're confident about Martin Marietta's prospects for the remainder of 2021. In May, we announced an agreement to acquire Lehigh Hanson's West Region. Those of you who joined us early this year for our Investor Day, we're likely not surprised when you read the announcement. The acquisition, which is consistent with and advances SOAR 2025 provides a new upstream materials led platform in three of the Western United States largest and fastest growing mega regions. With this leading Pacific presence will be well positioned to capitalize on long-term demand drivers from increased state infrastructure investment in California and Arizona, as well as continued private sector growth across these regions. This strategic acquisition also provides Martin Marietta with an enhanced coast-to-coast geographic footprint and serves as a viable platform for potential continued geographic expansion. We expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2021 following customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Lehigh West Region team to Martin Marietta. We're also very pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Tiller operations in the Minneapolis St. Paul region, which exceeded management's initial expectations since closing on April 30. Tiller contributed one million tons each of aggregates and asphalt during May and June, and provides Martin Marietta, an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest growing Midwestern metropolitan areas, while also expanding and complementing our product offerings in our existing operations and surrounding markets. Integration into our central division is underway and synergy realization is progressing as planned. This business remains on track to contribute $60 million of adjusted EBITDA this year. Martin Marietta has established a long track record of superior value creation by prudently balancing inorganic growth opportunities, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Our latest acquisitions and successful growth initiatives demonstrate that SOAR and our discipline capital deployment strategy continue to deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and other stakeholders, positioning our company for sustainable long-term operational and financial success. Now let's turn to the company's second quarter performance. We achieved record second quarter revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share, driven by strengthening product demand, pricing gains across all product lines, and meaningful contributions from the recently acquired Tiller acquisition. On a consolidated basis, products and services revenues increased 9% to $1.3 billion. Adjusted gross profit increased 3% to $393 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $439 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $3.81. Our Building Materials business continued to benefit from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment, and heavy industrial projects of scale. Adverse weather however, muted shipments, most notably in our top two revenue generating states are aggregates cement, and ready-mixed concrete operations in Texas, experienced lower than expected shipment levels as a result of excessive rainfall. In fact, the second quarter was Texas's 11th wettest on record. Additionally, Colorado home to our Front Range aggregates and downstream operations surpassed average annual precipitation levels during the first half of the year. Second quarter aggregate shipments increased 1.5% on an organic basis and 3% in total. East Group total shipments grew 7% strong demand across all end use markets in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland combined with shipments from the acquired Tiller operations, more than offset lower shipments in the Midwest from weather induced project delays. West Group shipments declined nearly 4% as Mother Nature interrupted otherwise robust construction activity in both Texas and Colorado. Organic aggregates average selling price increased over 3% supported by our value over volume pricing strategy led by the East Group. Geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher priced long-haul shipments limited West Group's reported pricing gains on a mix adjusted basis, West Group pricing increased 2.4%. We announced mid-year price increases in a number of markets, which should further contribute to favorable pricing trends heading into next year. Our Texas Cement business delivered solid operating performance, despite significant precipitation that disrupted more than one-third of the quarter's available shipping days. Second quarter shipments declined less than 2%. As major projects in South Texas, along with recovering energy sector activity helped mitigate weather impacts. Notably, we established an all time record for monthly cement shipments in June, largely due to the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Second quarter cement pricing increased 7% or 4% on a mix adjusted basis, as annual increases went into effect on April 1. Additionally, we've announced the second price increase of $8 per ton on September 1 for both North and South Texas. This represents the first midyear increase since 2014. Attractive demand drivers continued market tightness, and diversified customer backlogs will support sustainable construction activity and pricing for our Texas Cement operations over the next several years. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mixed concrete shipments increased to 8% despite significant weather headwinds driven by incremental volume from large non-residential projects and operations acquired last year in Texas. Concrete pricing increased modestly reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower priced Texas shipments. Overall asphalt shipments increased 68% driven by contributions from the Tiller operations, which more than offset weather related shipment declines in our Colorado asphalt and paving business. Colorado market fundamentals remain strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Organic asphalt pricing improved 4%. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta is attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long term secular demand trends across our three primary end-used markets will drive increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2021 and into the future. Demand for our construction products has grown. And we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contractor labor and supply shortages compounded by weather differ days that become increasingly difficult to recover is the year advances can govern the near term pace of overall construction activity. Fortunately, we expect work not completed this year to simply be pushed into 2022 and foresee bottlenecks like these moderating and throughput improving as federal unemployment benefits expire in September. We're also in the midst of the most significant seemingly bipartisan national infrastructure debate in a long time, with a number of proposals from both political parties to advance and address much needed investment. Regardless of the pathway to success or infrastructure legislation all proposals provide for sizeable increases in federal surface transportation funding over the fixing America's surface transportation, or FAST Act. We're optimistic that meaningful progress in Washington DC will be made and a FAST Act replacement will be passed before its expiration in September. Such legislation would immediately stimulate economic growth, contractor optimism and job creation, while also driving meaningful product demand starting in late 2022 and beyond. Our company's top five States Department of Transportation or DOTs are well positioned to put increased transportation dollars to work more specifically, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, which accounted for over 70% of our 2020 building materials revenues have an abundance of projects in their backlog that would benefit from higher federal funding and generate growing demand for our products. At the same time, increased visibility and funding certainty of the federal level supports a healthy pricing environment for construction materials. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 34% of second quarter shipments well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. Non-residential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers. We're also beginning to see early signs of recovery in the more COVID-19 impacted wide commercial and retail sectors, notably in key markets such as Denver, Atlanta, and the Texas triangle. Light non-residential activity should be a more significant demand driver in 2022 given the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 36% of second quarter shipments. Martin Marietta continues to be a beneficiary of single-family housing growth across the southeast and southwest. Single-family starch remains strong despite higher home prices and longer material delivery times supported by significant under building over the past decade, low mortgage rates and accelerated the urbanization trends. Importantly, single-family housing is two to three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction given the ancillary non-residential and infrastructure needs to build out new or expanding suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 25% of second quarter shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically, our second quarter financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we're proud of our record first half results and industry-leading safety performance and remain highly confident in our outlook for the balance of 2021. Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends that are expected to support sustainable construction activity, both in the near and long-term. As we soar to a sustainable future, our focus remains on building the safest, best performing and most sustainable aggregates lead public company, thanks to our disciplined execution of SOAR, commitment to safe and efficient operations and our dedication to both commercial and operational excellence. Today Martin Marietta is superbly positioned. We're confident in Martin Marietta's ability to deliver sustainable growth and superior shareholder value in 2021 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. No, happy too, Stanley. Good morning and nice to hear your voice. So, you're right September one is going to be an important date in cement. We're taking that pricing up as you indicated $8 a ton. But as we also indicated during it when we were at the end of the first quarter, we thought we would see more mid-year price increases than we've seen in years past. That's entirely what's happening. If we're looking on the aggregate side first and look at our East Division, we're looking in a number of places for $1 a ton on clean stone, $0.50 a ton on based on all effective July 1. So that's something that that we put into effect. But equally, we're looking at aggregate price increases mid-year in the southwest division. So for example, in North Texas, and for purposes of this read Dallas-Fort Worth, we're looking at $0.50 to $0.75 of time on September 1. In Austin, we're looking more at $1 a ton on August 1. At Hunter Stone, which was one of those sound centers Houston TX, where we have the quarry in conjunction with a cement plant in New Braunfels. We're looking $0.50 to $1 a ton on August 1 and a Garwood down just outside Houston, Sand Gravel facility looking at $1 a ton there. So that's what we're seeing on the stone side of it. Now equally, and I think this is important, Stanley. We're looking for that also in readymix, particularly in Texas. So, we're looking for ranges anywhere from $4, a cubic yard in Austin, and in East Texas, up to $6 a cubic yard in North Texas. So, if we think about what we're seeing in mid years, we're seeing it in aggregates, we're seeing it in the east, we're seeing it in the southwest. We're seeing it in cement and our uniquely Texas business today. And we're also seeing in readymix in Texas. So again, the type of backdrop that we anticipated, we will see Stanley I'm happy to report that to you. Yes. So what I'll say relative to the grinding capacity again, that's something that we're finishing that we'll be adding to Midlothian. So you'll hear more about that as we go into 2022. Again, that's a market that we believe simply needs that. With respect to the maintenance in cement, you're exactly right, if you think back to 2020. Part of what we indicated coming into 2021 is that we would spend more in cement maintenance. In fact, we had indicated to the market early on, that we thought we would spend about $6 million more on kiln and finish mill outages in 2021 than we did in 2020. And really Q2 was the time to do that. So if you're looking at the delta, on what we did last year in Q2, and what we did this year in Q2, on cement maintenance, it was about $7.3 million difference. So, we spent that much more in Q2 than we did last year. So in other words, that full annual difference that we had anticipated that you should expect. We pretty much did that in Q2. So what we're expecting is a very comparable smooth run here in the second half of the year. And frankly, we're expecting better margins in that business in the second half of the year as a consequence. Thank you, Stanley. No, you bet Kathryn. So several things. Let's talk about the margin piece at first, because as Jim indicated, in his commentary and there was prepared, energy was up $24 million for the quarter. So I mean, that's a big number. And if we look at diesel fuel all by itself that was up almost $15 million. So, if we go and look at our diesel fuel usage that was a little bit over 12 and million gallons, excuse me a diesel fuel up about $1.11 per gallon. So if we go and pull that energy piece of it out and look at the margins, actually, what you'll see on the margins across the enterprise is that adjusted gross margins actually improved over Q2, 2020. What that tells me, Kathryn is the underlying performance of the cost side of the business is actually doing extraordinarily well. So, what I'm pleased with is the underlying cost is doing well. And we're seeing the price move forward in a way that we thought that we would particularly as the economy continues to improve. Now, with respect to your question on guidance, in particular, you're right, some had some things moving around one, we did just drop in what we had indicated verbally before, and that was we expect $60 million of EBITDA contribution from the acquired Tiller operations. Equally, if we're looking at our cement business that has noted for intended, whether the deep freeze in Texas in February and then as we indicated an extraordinarily wet Q2. We've taken cement down a little bit and of course, readymix is going to follow that so we pulled that down a little bit. And asphalt and paving in Colorado had a very challenging year-over-year or so we pulled those down. But we've equally taken Magnesia Specialties, backup. So those are some of the broader puts and takes that we have, if we look overall at the pricing, we've really not changed price. And we've kept that very consistent with where we thought, keep in mind the mid years that we're putting in will not affect pricing that much this year is setting the stage even more robustly for 2022. And we did pull aggregate volume down just a hair in large measure. We're just looking at the days left in the year. It's not an indication of any lack of robustness in the market. At some point, today's just get shorter. So Kathryn, I hope that answers your series of questions. You're welcome. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. One, if we think about volume guidance in the second half, whether it's implying is basically about a 4% increase in volume in the second half. And you're right, what we're anticipating is we're going to see some accelerating pricing. A number of the things that we seen during the first half of the year that I think is important is we've seen considerably more bass work than we have before. I think that's actually good, because as you may recall, base work ends up turning into finished work on top of that. So you're going to see several things. One, we believe North Carolina, Georgia, and the East will continue to perform actually quite well. If you're looking overall at the volume. And again, the volume is going to have some degree of impact on ASP if you think about geographic mix. The East Group in the first half was up 7%, excluding, Tiller, it was up 4%. But it's important to note that Tiller's pricing is about 30%, lower than heritage, Martin Marietta. So that actually gave us a modest headwind. So if we're looking at what I think will be more clean stone sales most likely in the second half of the year have continued good performance in the East. And in some instances, we were selling some products that were in reserve. And typically those tend to go for a relatively lower average selling price. I think it does back in triangulating around the number that you had indicated. And yes, we continue to have good confidence around that in the back half of the year. You're welcome. Well, I think you clearly will get some benefit from mid years in the second half. Now, the fact is, most of that, as we discussed, rate is going to play more into next year. I think the other thing that we saw a bit in the first half is we did see a bit more maintenance and repair. And some of that was tied in to the acquisition activity as well. So we think that's going to moderate itself. So I think that's clearly going to come back and help on the margin piece of it. I think the other thing is, if we simply look at what was happening in Texas, and in Colorado, it's difficult to be as efficient as you want to be when you're dealing with those high degrees of rainfall as well. So we're entering a period of time that typically is drier, we're entering a period of time that some of the mid years will play in, we're entering a period of time where I think we're going to see more clean stone going relative to base. And I think we're entering a period of time, that you're likely to see less maintenance and repair because in many respects, people are simply blowing and going in Q3. So, I think you take that combination of factors, I think it comes back and addresses some of the margin questions I'll turn to my colleague, Mr. Nickolas, and he has anything he wants to add to that, Trey. Look, thanks for the question very much on that. And obviously, we're all watching what happened in the Senate last night? I guess the good news is I'm not sure that here we were that surprised by so look, based on the way that we see it. It's that overall proposal, trillion dollars, five years $550 billion in new spending. And really, if we're looking at roads and bridges Trey, that's going to be by our math, about $110 billion, that's going to be around $39 billion for public transport, another $66 billion for rail, and keep in mind with the largest balance producer in the country, $25 billion for airports and about $17 billion for ports. So, I mean, that's going to be a lot of work. What does that mean? Overall? I think it means several things. One, its recognition that it's overdue. Number two, it's a recognition that at least from our perspective, Trey, and you heard in prepared remarks. Having watched this business for a long time in this industry for a long time, typically 40 some percent of our products is finding its way to highways, bridges, roads and streets. And we've been in the 30s for the last several years. And that's really evidence of the fact that there's not been the level of investment at the federal level that was needed. So if we're looking simply the senate bipartisan plan, and we're looking at what that means from a percentage up from baseline, FY 2021 appropriations and invest, it's up about 46% from the baseline. So this is not a trifling number. And what I really liked about it, too, is if you look at the vote last night on basically the closure motion, what you're going to find is 67 senators voted for this, and among them was Mitch Mcconnell. And so when we start looking at where Senate leadership is, and who really came along to move that vote along, it was some pretty notable players. And the other thing that I think is important is obviously the pay for us are going to matter. And this and when we look at the pay for us at least, how they've been pulled together in the senate version, you've got a lot of repurpose, COVID relief that's going into this. You've got some unused unemployment insurance that's going into it. And then obviously, they're going to be looking at it degrees of economic growth that's going to be derived from the program's investment. In other words, dynamic scoring, that's also going to be a piece of it. So the fact that it got that degree of a vote that it got that type of support from senators [indiscernible] Senator Portman is an McConnell. We think it's important and we think it helps put the industry in attractive place, not just from an infrastructure perspective going forward. But we believe residential is going to remain strong. We think heavy non-res is going to remain strong, and we think res is going to inflect. That light portion of non-res. Long story short, we think this bill, if it's pushed forward into law, and we believe it will be before the FAST Act expires, puts the industry in a very attractive place for a multiyear run trend. You bet. Take care. Phil, that's a great question. And I would submit to you it's not so much driven by tightness right now. I think it's driven more by what is anticipated; I think is driven by a much higher degree of confidence. If we're looking at the condition of most DOTs in the East States, DOTS are actually in a very, very good place. For example, if we look at where North Carolina Department Transportation is, I mean, their financial issues are very much in the past with 22 lettings a $2.7 billion. That's up. I mean, if you can imagine 260% from the prior year. So if we're looking at what's happening relative to homebuilding in these markets, if we're looking at what's going on with respect to infrastructure, if we're looking at a very healthy non-res environment as well in the East, it all looks very, very attractive, whether that's going to be in North Carolina, or Georgia or South Carolina or Florida as well. The other thing that I think is really telling is when we pause and take a look at the backlogs and backlogs are always something funny in this industry because it's a practical matter. They usually represent only around 25% or 35% of annual aggregates and cement going forward. But it does give you a good dipstick into the tank to get a sense of where things are. And total aggregates backlogs is pretty attractive. It's around 13% ahead a prior year levels. So again, if we're going back to the notion of overall contractor competence, if we're looking at it, people who are going to be busy and they know they're going to be busy, and then seeing broadly an overall inflationary market in a lot of different respects. It's actually a very appropriate and opportune moment for us to make sure that we're getting the value for a spec material that not everybody can put on the ground. Though, we that's a great point, we clearly are starting to see better activity on white non-res I mean, If we're looking Colorado, I mean, clearly office retail and hospitality is looking for a stronger inflection in half, two, if we're looking here in our backyard in North Carolina, it's been fairly fascinating to watch I mean retail and hospitality are both already beginning to inflect. And we're starting to see strong corporate reloads here. Population trends are following that. We've got Apple and Google making significant investments here. And again, as we're looking at markets like Florida, office, hotel, retail, and industrial activity in that marketplace actually continues to really be quite strong. A lot of what's driving it and look we get. The U.S. is added since 2000, over 48 million people in population. And what that's doing is it's driving, what we're seeing now in single family housing and then single family housing is driving what we're starting to see but basically the way that we thought we would during analyst Investor Day, here is we go into half to fill. So I hope that helps. Thank you. No happy to number one, we're thrilled to have Tiller as part of this organization, culturally and otherwise they have wonderfully for us, you've heard what I said in the prepared remarks. Basically, in May and June, they sold a million tons of aggregates and a million tons of hot mix. By the way, I think their history that's the fastest they've ever gotten to that million tons in hot mix. I think what you're seeing is several things one, the Minneapolis St. Paul market is a good healthy Midwest market, it tends to be very steady. We're seeing good activity there. We talked before about the fact that Minneapolis St. Paul actually consumes more tons of aggregates in hot mix on a per annum basis, than even Charlotte does, which is a premier market here. So again, I think from a timing perspective, and from a market perspective, and putting their business together with ours, in that important market to us, the timing was good, the operational synergies are going to be real. We have a lot that we can learn from each other there. Tiller is extraordinarily good. On the asphalt side, they are already teaching us things that we can take from that. I think we can help them on the aggregate side. But I will tell you, they are very good on the aggregate side. So again, if we're looking at margins in that business, they tend to start with a three. So again, I think everything that we were hoping that we would see in that transaction is come through. Yes, the other thing that's happening too is they have some very attractive real estate that they've been able to sell, we've been able to sell. That actually takes the overall purchase price paid for the business and pulls it down, actually very nicely. So, I'm happy to report to you, Garik, there's nothing about that transaction, that as you might be able to glean from my commentary that we're not gushing about right now. So, we're very pleased with it, and think they're great things to come. Thank you, Garik. Hey, Mike. Number one, thanks for the question. Because that's an extraordinary business, it does not get the airtime that it is earned and it deserves. So, what I would say is several things, what you're seeing in the business this quarter isn't so much an unusual pop. This is more like returning to usual for that business. So, if we think about what was happening globally, last year, this time, steel was in a very challenging place. Overseas chemicals was in a challenging place, because in many respects, markets were closed. So, if we go back to June of 2020, steel was running at about 55% capacity, today it's running at around 83%. So that's a good healthy number. Everything that we're seeing in that market tells us that we expect that business to run strong and remain strong, certainly for the rest of this year. The other thing that we're seeing is cobalt. And that ends up being an important market for us overseas is up 52% since the end of 2020. So, when we're looking at how the business is performing on steel, where it's performing relative to its chemicals business all that's really quite good. And here's what's even more impressive, because if you keep in mind, energy has actually been going up during much of this year. Keep in mind that is a large count driven business in portions of it, both in Woodville and in Manistee. And typically as nat gas goes, it can have a profound effect, why not have profound effects a notable effect on the way that business is operating. And basically what we're seeing is their ability to manage their costs extraordinarily well. They continue to get good pricing. And we believe that business back to the essence of your question is in fact very, very durable, Mike. So, we expect continued great things from Mag Specialties. But again, thank you for the question. Yes, that's a great question. And there can't be enough Magnesia Specialties loss. So thank you for brought to the question. That is the business that in many respects is running at capacity right now. And we've recognized that so much of what that business is doing is several folds. One is looking for ways to de-bottleneck and run things more efficiently. Number two, it continues to look at its product mix, and will continue to drive more of what it's doing to its higher margin products. They've had a great history of doing that. I'm sure they have a very bright future of doing that as well. Part of that so difficult about that business, and it's one of the great things about the business is we produce 24% of the dolomitic lime in North America from our facility at Woodville and opening permitting and otherwise, the dolomitic lime plant is very costly, it is very time consuming. Both our facilities in Manistee and in Woodville have title five operating permits, they operate very, very efficiently. So adding more capacity is something that it's very difficult, we're always looking for responsible ways to grow the business. But I think in the near term, what you can anticipate is de-bottlenecking, focusing on higher margin products. And at the end of the day, we're going to be focused on pricing in that business just as we are in the aggregates in cement business. So Joe, I hope that helps. Yes, no, happy too. As I've indicated our FY 2022 learning's just looking at NCDOT for a second are increasing 260%. So I mean, clearly, DOT in a much different, very healthy place right now. Keep in mind, that's an overall DOT with an annual budget around $5 billion. So that's on the public side. If we look on the non-res, I would say several things. If you think about North Carolina really working from the middle of the state to a little bit farther west, you end up in Raleigh Durham. Then you farther west of Greensboro, high point Winston Salem into Charlotte, all markets in which we have leading positions. So, if I think about what's going on in Charlotte, for example, from a non-res perspective, Charlotte continues to be a significant beneficiary of a lot of warehousing activity. You've got I-77, I-85, and a host of large thoroughfares that are coming together in what's effectively the capital of the Carolinas, if you think about it. What's important too is in places like Greensboro in the Triad again, we're seeing good warehouse and we're seeing good medical and surprisingly healthy retail activity there. But here's part of what I think is driving that. So for example, D.R. Horton recently announced their plans to build a 1000 homes subdivision in Greensboro. What I'm going to suggest to you Joe, if you go back in time and listen to the last time I was talking about somebody building 1000 homes subdivision in the Triad, it's been a while. So the fact is, if you're seeing that type of single-family housing growth in the Triad, you're going to continue to see good non-res activity. And I spoke just a few minutes ago about what's happening here in the Raleigh Durham area, with Apple with Google with generally what's happening in the Research Triangle Park. And keep in mind, when you've got North Carolina State University in Raleigh, the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill and Duke University in Durham, you've got three large universities that tend to drive a lot of economic activity, and you got state government here. And so this is an area that in good times does extraordinarily well, in more challenging times. You're not going to say it's recession proof, but it's pretty close. So those are the types of things that we're seeing in North Carolina, Joe. Thank you. Take care of rest of the day. You bet, Josh. Well, we've done our best to make those and as a practical matter of what you're doing, Josh is you are protecting people who already have prices from you, as a general rule, what I would tell you is you're going to recognize about 25% of a mid-year price increase, if in fact, you're putting them in at mid-year in the year that they're baked in. So that's how I've asked you to think about those, in many respects, the mid-years that I outlined for you on aggregates, at least in the East were effective on July 1. Now, keep in mind, when I went through those different portions of the Southwest, most of those were effective on August 1, somewhere effective September 1. So we've done our best to bake that into what we have, but it can be a little bit elusive at times. The balance of the year ought to be a pretty smooth run, because as I think I indicate in conversation with Stanley. We had indicated there was going to be a vast $6 million delta more in 2021 than there was in 2020. And again, we had outlined the fact that in Q2, the maintenance costs were up about $7.3 million. All right, very good. Thank you so much. Take care, Josh. And again, thank you all for joining today's earnings call. We'll continue to focus on maximizing value for shareholders as we build on our strong results and continue executing on our SOAR 2025 plan. We look forward to sharing our third quarter of 2021 results in a few months. As always, we're available for any follow up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and your continued support Martin Marietta. Please stay safe and healthy. We'll speak to you soon."

            "content": "Thanks, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The Building Materials business posted products and services revenues of $1.2 billion a 7% increase from last year's second quarter and product gross profit of $357 million. Aggregates established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit, higher diesel costs and a $6 million negative impact from selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting are reflected in product gross margin of 34%. Excluding the acquisition impact adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 34.8% a 70 basis point decline versus prior year. In addition, gross profit per ton shipped, improved modestly when excluding the impact of acquisition accounting. So net product gross margin declined 870 basis points despite top-line growth, driven by the timing and scope of planned kill maintenance, as well as higher energy and raw material costs. While our first half results were impacted by some weather related headwinds, our cement business is well positioned benefit from a growing demand and tight supply. Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin declined 350 basis points to 7%, a shipment and pricing gains were offset the higher costs for raw materials and diesel. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million a 43% increase, revenue growth more than offset higher energy costs for energy and contract services, driving a 260 basis point improvement in product gross margin to 39.9%. On a consolidated basis, earnings from operations included more than $9 million of acquisition related costs, as well as a $12 million gain on the sale of property. This gain is non-recurring in nature and should not be extrapolated for run rate purposes. Relative to often cited broader economic questions regarding supply chain and inflation. We are pleased that our overall supply chain remains resilient with only a handful of indications of strain for some suppliers. On the cost inflation front, the only notable headwinds we have seen are from increased energy costs. For the second quarter alone, our total energy costs increased $24 million companywide. Absent this headwind, our consolidated adjusted margins would have outpaced prior year, a testament to our team's commitment to cost control and operational excellence. We remain focused on the discipline execution of our proven strategy and our long standing capital allocation priorities that preserve our healthy balance sheet, financial flexibility and investment grade credit rating profile. As Ward noted, we continue to balance value enhancing inorganic growth opportunities with prudent capital spending and returning cash to shareholders. To that end, we have raised our full year capital spending guidance to $450 million to $500 million as you prioritize high return capital projects focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends, as well as share repurchases. As of June 30, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9 times. In late June, we access the capital markets to finance the Lehigh West Region transaction issuing $2.5 billion of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and weighted average tenure of 15 years. The bond sale settled in early July, and as such is not reflected in our second quarter results. We expect pro forma leverage at year end to be above our target range. Consistent with our practice of repaying debt, following significant acquisitions, we are committed to returning to our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times within 18 months following the closing of the transaction. As detailed in today's release, we've updated our full year guidance to reflect current expectations, the completion of the Tiller acquisition and the $2.5 billion bond offering. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.465 billion to $1.535 billion. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. Sure. Thanks Trey, happy too. One notable thing and energy is our own guidance committee new guidance, we've increased energy expense by $34 million. And despite that, your margin question our incremental for the year, once the year is all said and done, we're expecting 50% incremental margins, still the accurate side despite that heavier energy expense. So by and large, we're very happy with where things are ending up. And just to put in perspective, 2021 to energy expense and diesel, while higher versus last year, it's pretty much in line with what we saw in 2019. So for us, this is not much of a stretch to kind of keep putting and good margins in."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now on a listen-mode. A question and answer session will follow the company\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's first quarter 2021 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements.

In addition, any non-GAAP measures disclosed today are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our earnings release and SEC filings. Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our first quarter operating performance and market trends as well as our recently completed acquisition of Tillar Corporation. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results after which Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. I'll now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. As evidenced by our first quarter results and successful targeted growth initiatives, it's clear that Martin Marietta is off to an impressive start in 2021. Thanks to the company's differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review plan, what we refer to as SOAR, we remain well positioned for continued success. As we look to the remainder of 2021 and beyond, we expect to build on a track record of strong financial, operational, integrated and safety performance. Supported by our team's steadfast commitment to safe and efficient operations, price discipline and operational excellence, we established first quarter records for revenues, profits and safety. Both building materials and magnesia specialties benefited from strengthening product demand. Specifically, consolidated products and services revenues increased 3% to $922 million, consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $175 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased of 37% to $204 million and diluted earnings per share grew over 2.5 times to $1.04. We also achieved the best first quarter safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding or trending at world class levels. At the same time, we are thoughtfully executing on our SOAR growth priorities to enhance our geographic footprint and grow our business. As announced in this morning's release, we successfully completed the acquisition of Tiller Corporation the leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis St. Paul region and welcomed more than 200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team. Tiller provides an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the Midwest and expands and complements the product offerings of our existing operations in surrounding markets. Tillers cultural fit, attracted margins and value over volume operating philosophy directly aligned with our central division operations. We expect a seamless and successful integration. Now let's turn to the company's first quarter operating performance. The Building Materials business saw strengthening product demand from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and notable heavy industrial projects of scale in our key geographies. Our aggregates, Cement and ready mixed concrete business in Texas, our largest revenue-generating state experienced temporary disruptions from February's historic winter ice storm and sub freezing temperatures. Additionally, our aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, our second largest state by revenues, faced a challenging comparison as our results in the same period last year, benefited from unseasonably favorable weather conditions in the Rocky mountains. Overall, aggregate shipments declined 3%, in line with our expectations, given return to typical first quarter seasonality factors and the largely non-COVID-19 impacted prior year quarter. Notably, East Group aggregate shipments increased as the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, benefited from strong residential and heavy industrial nonresidential activity. This growth offset lower shipments in the Midwest from more seasonal construction activity and reduced wind energy projects. While underlying product demand remains robust, unfavorable winter weather conditions in both Texas and Colorado and a softer energy sector market resulted in an 8% decline in West group shipments. Aggregates average selling price increased 3.4% or 2.5% on a mix adjusted basis. These pricing gains supported by our locally driven pricing strategy, highlight contractor confidence and underlying construction activity in the attractive markets that we serve. East Group pricing increased 4% with both East and Central divisions contributing solid growth geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced long-haul shipments limited to West Group's pricing gain to 2%. Our cement business delivered strong first quarter operating performance and shipment growth despite the disruptions from February's historic high storm, I'm extremely grateful to our teams, their actions to proactively winterize and take our plants offline, allowed us to quickly return to normal production capacity post storm. To that effect, our cement operations established an all-time record from monthly shipments in March, demonstrating the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Mix adjusted pricing grew 2% during the quarter. Annual cement prices went into effect April 1 and have garnered widespread support in both North and South Texas. We expect our Cement business will continue to benefit from favorable market trends supported by continued market type as in Texas and diversified customer backlogs. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Our ready-mix concrete operations established a first quarter record for shipments, which increased nearly 27% to 2 million cubic yards. Large nonresidential projects and incremental volume from operations acquired late last year contributed to double-digit shipment growth in Texas, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in Colorado. Concrete pricing declined 2%, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from a return to more typical winter weather conditions versus the prior year period, resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. As well pricing, however, improved 8%. Colorado market fundamentals remained strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular trends across our three primary end-use markets will drive sustainable construction led, aggregates intensive growth for the foreseeable future. We are encouraged by the recent initial gold steps to advance much needed infrastructure investment and a general consensus for success or legislation to the fixing America's surface transportation, or Fast Act in the coming months. With both congressional chambers working on their own reauthorization proposals, we're optimistic that a Fast Act replacement and increased funding levels will be passed before its expiration in September generating meaningful shipment benefits in 2022 and beyond. In the meantime, state and local infrastructure funding remains resilient. Estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top five state departments of transportations or DOT\u2019s, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top five states, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to our business, representing 71% of total revenues for our 2020 building materials business. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 30% of first quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. The nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, broadly offsetting weakness in the more COVID-19 impacted like commercial and retail sectors. Light nonresidential activity should benefit from the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth in the longer term, in some regions, we're now seeing early signs of that recovery. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 37% of first quarter shipments. Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 times to 3 times where aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 27% of first quarter shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our first quarter financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We achieved the highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 2007. The Building Materials business established first quarter records for revenues and profitability. Products and services revenues increased 3% and to $857 million, while gross profit increased 25% to $148 million. We continue to drive sustainable and best-in-class aggregates unit profitability growth through the combination of price discipline and operational excellence. For the quarter, aggregates gross profit per ton shipped improved 34% to $3.28 and product gross margin expanded 490 basis points to 21.3% despite lower shipment volumes. In addition to pricing gains, lower contract services and internal freight costs contributed to these improvements. Our cement operations benefited from a 3% top line improvement. However, extended kiln downtime, reduced production levels and nearly $7 million of incremental energy and other costs all directly due to February's Texas deep freeze, led to a 1,160 basis point degradation in product gross margins. While these weather disruptions were headwinds to our first quarter results, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from growing demand and tight supply and remains on track to achieve its full year guidance. Ready mixed concrete product gross margin improved 520 basis points to 8.3%, driven by double-digit shipment growth and lower delivery and raw material costs. Magnesia specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $65 million, a 9% increase. Higher shipment and production levels, combined with ongoing cost management, resulted in product gross margins of 43.5% and which matched the first quarter record established in the prior year. Now a look at our cash generation and capital allocation. The first quarter was a record for cash generation. Operating cash flows of $192 million increased 80%, driven by earnings growth and a reduction in working capital. We continue to balance our disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. All while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. We continue to prioritize high-returning capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Full year capital expenditures are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our first quarter earnings and cash generation were both records. As a result, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.8 times as of March 31, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times. As Ward highlighted, our disciplined execution of SOAR 2025 is underway. Last week, we completed the Tiller acquisition. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow and contribute $170 million of revenues and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in the remaining 8 months of 2021. We financed the transaction using a combination of cash on our balance sheet and drawing an accounts receivable credit facility. Our full year 2021 guidance remains unchanged from the guidance provided in February and excludes the expected contribution of the Tiller acquisition. That said, we will revisit our 2021 guidance when we report our half year results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our record first quarter results and industry-leading safety performance. Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends that are expected to support sustainable construction activity both in the near and long term. As we SOAR to a sustainable future, we will continue to build on the foundation that has proven so successful, an aggregates led growth platform, an unwavering commitment to disciplined pricing, operational excellence and safety and solid execution of our proven strategy. We're confident in Martin Marietta's outlook for the balance of 2021 and our ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value creation in 2021 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your question please.\nKathryn Thompson: Also, as you said in an earlier call today, this is TRG's 12 anniversary and Ward, if I recall, correctly, you guys would the very first moment marketing with and also the last before going into a global shutdown, but thank you over the years for your support.\nWard Nye: I thank you and congratulations on team that you built at TRG.\nKathryn Thompson: So the question today is around guidance. If you could just clarify and delineate the heritage guidance versus the additive that you outlined in today's release with Tillar help us understand why it wasn't raised and also leading into that, helping us better understand the current situation with cement in Texas given the shortages and how that also plays into your heritage guidance?\nWard Nye: Kathryn, again, congratulations to you and your team. I guess, a couple of things. One, the guidance that we've reaffirmed this morning is simply our heritage guidance. So again, we've given you revenue and EBITDA numbers for Tiller which you would need to go and add, obviously, to the heritage guidance to get what the effective guidance would be today. So that math is there. It's very easy to do. And the other thing that we've not done is changed guidance for the year here based on Q1. So remember, we're in an outdoor sport, and this has been January, February and March, and our view was changing it after those three months feels a bit premature to us. And again, I think we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year that was modestly ahead of where others have come out as well. So I think we have seen some degrees of guidance change today. But I think in many respects, it's been an effort to more balance where we were when we came out at the beginning of the year. So that's where we are relative to heritage guidance, please to add to that, what we've given you with respect to Tiller. As Jim said in his prepared remarks, we will come back at half year and revisit guidance. One of the things, obviously, I think we'll be revisiting will be what is happening with cement. As you know, Katherine, that's the second part of your question. We only have cement in Texas. And I'll draw several things to your attention. Number one, if we're looking at our backlogs in cement, the backlog in cement year-over-year are actually up pretty considerably. We're seeing cement tons up 24%. So number one, that's a nice takeaway.  Number two, the results that we turned in for the first quarter were despite the fact that, that business was effectively shut down for 11 days in February when Texas up with some unseasonably cold weather. We incurred about $7 million of expenses in semi business tied directly to energy and other pure production costs. We also had some inefficiencies that came from that. That ended up giving us effectively nearly a $14 million headwind, simply driven by that 11-day period. The other thing that I'll point out is, obviously, we do have a price increase that went into effect on April 1 that's at $8 a ton in that marketplace.  The other thing that we have done, recognizing that it's going to be tight in Texas this year on cement. We have put out a letter in the marketplace, and we've let our customers know that we're anticipating another $8 a ton price increase in September. So again, as we come back and give you some very specific answers to your question on cement and then ticking and tying that back to the guidance question. These are all a number of the variables that we will take into account as we revisit guidance at half year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.\nTrey Grooms: So Ward, during your recent Analyst Day, M&A was a major theme, and it's encouraging to see you announce an accretive acquisition this morning. So first off, can you talk about the deal rationale there? How growing your presence in the Minneapolis St. Paul market plays into your footprint strategically? And any color about the outlook and the health of that market there?\nWard Nye: I'll happy to. You led off with the right thing about is, look, we see this. It's accretive to cash and earnings in year 1. That's a nice place to start when we're thinking Tiller. If we think about to the SOAR process, keep in mind, we've long said that we have a leading position in 90% of our markets. Would that lead you to conclude that in 10% of the markets were not 1 or 2 this was 1 of the 10% of the markets. So again, we like the Minneapolis, St. Paul Marketplace. We wanted to be a leader in that marketplace. Through our SOAR process, we had identified Minneapolis, St. Paul as an MSA in which we wanted to grow. We had identified Tiller specifically as a target that we wanted to see if we could bring into Martin Marietta. And there are several reasons for that. Number one, if we look at Minneapolis, St. Paul, it's the 12th largest MSA in terms of aggregate consumption in the United States. So one of the things that got my attention was when I saw that they're actually more aggregates consumed in Minneapolis, St. Paul, than there are in Charlotte, which was not something that I think is intuitive to a lot of people. The other thing that's worth noting is Minnesota maintains the nation's fifth largest highway system, and they've got a budget of about $3.8 billion, and about 90% of that goes to highways purchasing roads. So we like the way that they invest in that place.  The other thing that I would say is this is a leading upstream business. It's aggregates led. It does have hot mix, but I want to be really clear here, Trey. It's not a laid out business. They're producing Blacktop that's basically being sold to contractors. So historically, Tiller has operated through a couple of subsidiaries, Barton Sanda Gravel, and that's literally their Sandy Gravel business and then a business called Commercial Asphalt. So those two businesses really comprise what they have. It's about 15-plus sites in the twin cities area. They've got a 30-year average pot life at their different locations. And again, they have an EBITDA there that learns very, very nicely with what we have in the central division. So back to SOAR, back to leading positions and in markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near-term and long term, that's what Tiller brings this organization. The other thing that I would say is, philosophically, the organizations are extraordinarily well aligned. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we closed on that Friday, and we were absolutely thrilled to bring several hundred people from Tiller into the Martin Marietta organization track.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your question please.\nPhil Ng : Congrats on a really strong quarter despite some challenging weather to start the year. I guess based on some back of envelope math, it looks like the full year aggregate guidance would imply some margin degradation, call it 30 basis points to 110 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Can you expand on that? I don't know if we're simply over extrapolating 1Q and you guys are not changing your full years because it's just too early. But any color in terms of margins the rest of the year for aggregates would be really helpful.\nWard Nye: Look, Phil, I would say it's really more the latter than the former. And that is -- don't be too linear just looking at what's out there. What I would say is we're not updating guidance right now simply because it's Q1. Obviously, we're very excited about what we saw in Q1. We're really excited about the fact that places like North Carolina VOT are back. The other thing that we're seeing in Q1 that I think we'll continue to see through the year as price fell through very, very nicely. You saw that. The other thing that I think we know we saw in Q1 was very good cost performance. I anticipate that we will continue to see good cost performance throughout the year. I think that's where you can have some degrees of give and take. The fact was diesel is likely to become an increasing headwind as we go through the year. Frankly, in Q1, it wasn't much of a headwind. It wasn't much of a tailwind either, but if we look at some of the cost buckets in which we saw a nice outperformance year-over-year, freight, moving material from a producing location to a yard was actually nicely better year-over-year.  Now if we see more sales going out of sales yards as the year goes on, obviously, that freight number would move. So with revenue, a number of things have moved with that. What I'll tell you as well as contract services were down. In other words, there were some stripping and other components that were down. Repairs were down, and we think those are likely the types of things that we will be able to hold on to. And I think that's evidence of good capital spend. Equally, we saw lower personnel costs. If you recall, last year, we did do some restructuring that was not necessarily COVID related, the timing of it just worked out very, very nicely. So what I would encourage you not to do is, again, take the guidance that we've not changed and then just assume everything continues in a linear fashion. Again, that's why we want to come back at half year and address it.  But again, I like the pricing dynamics that we're seeing in both aggregates and in cement. I think our teams have done an extraordinary job relative to costs. Again, if you're looking at gross profit per ton in the quarter, and you saw that going up at 34.5%. And if you're looking cash gross profit per ton to growth, I mean, we were almost 23% on that from what I can tell that looks like best-in-class types of metrics. So again, we're -- we feel very good about where we sit right now. And to be clear, we feel good about the balance of the year.\nPhil Ng : Okay. Super helpful. It sounds like, all the good work you\u2019ll doing on the cost front and the pricing is taking that\u2019s really encouraging.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nStanley Elliott: You mentioned the strong Q1. Any commentary you'd want to share with us around how April trended relative to expectations? And then along those lines, kind of commentary for pricing overall?\nWard Nye: I'll address more pricing than I will, April last year, Stan, as you recall, we actually did talk a little bit about the quarters ahead, and we were being encouraged to do that by the SEC and others because it was such an extraordinary period of time. And as you know, our view typically is to live very tightly within the quarters. And we were doing that in large part because people were removing guidance last year. So I won't go into April, per se. I will say, clearly, there was nice momentum coming into Q1. Relative to pricing, but I would say is there are no surprises. On the aggregates piece of it, it's working exactly the way that we would have anticipated and the way that we planned. You saw the breakdown between reported and mix adjusted, as we talked about the quarter, again, reported up 3.4%, mix adjusted at 2.5%. Again, that's very much within the guide that we've given. I do think it's possible this year that you might see some aggregate tightness in certain markets on certain sizes. It's hard to tell at this moment, but I certainly think that, that's possible. If we see some of that, I think we could see some very discrete price changes maybe on a size basis later in the year. All of that's relative to aggregates.  If we're speaking of cement, it's obviously a different circumstance. So keep in mind, this is not a nationwide cement business. This is a Texas Cement business. Cement is tight in Texas. We feel very good about the $8 increase that we put into effect on April 1. We expect all of that, for example, the stick in the North Texas market. We think most of that is going to stick in the central market as well. And again, as I think I indicated before, our intention -- stated intention, published intention by letters to our customers is another $8 a ton price increase on September 1 and to give you a sense of it, that's going to be the first midyear that we believe that market is going to see since 2014. So I think that gives you a good sense of at least the degree of confidence that we have in pricing in that market standing. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTimna Tanners: I wanted to ask a little bit more about costs, if I could. Obviously, diesel is the most transparent, but you've seen huge increases in materials such as steel that I know you use a lot of we're hearing tightness in labor and transportation and other. So if you could address some of those challenges and any offsets that we could think about going forward, that would be great.\nWard Nye: No, Timna, I appreciate the question. If we go through our business, we're not seeing significant hits from inflation as we look at it again. So if we think about the buckets that will be cost for us, our single biggest bucket is going to be personnel. I mean the biggest thing that we're going to be able to flex there is what overtime hours look like in some markets because we largely have the teams in place that we need to put the material on the ground. The other thing that on some occasions, can be a bit of a challenge in some circumstances be freight, as we indicated in the first quarter, freight was actually down because we're seeing less moved by rail. I mean, if that goes up later in the year, what I would suggest to you is that's probably going to be a relatively high-class problem. So we're certainly not concerned about that. Again, we've got a good set of vendors. We have a good supply chain in place. Most of our supply chain is domestic. We think that very much cuts in our favor. So again, as we're looking at our overall cost profile, Timna so I'm very happy to report to you. We don't see anything on the cost profile that we feel like is going to be anything in a particular moment. I'll turn it to Jim to see if he has anything he'd like to add to that.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. No, the steel prices as a commodity market matter, obviously, are very elevated. We're not seeing it. We actually did a prebuy of mobile equipment from caterpillar earlier in the year. So we think we got ahead of any price increases that are coming our way. And to the extent that steel prices are inflating, plant, equipment, et cetera, we'll probably see that next year, but we're not seeing it yet this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: You pointed to lower contract services in the quarter as a driver of improved gross margin. And I'm just wondering if you can provide any more detail on what drove that and how we should expect contract services maybe to come back or trend in 2Q or the remainder of the year?\nWard Nye: What I think the primary thing, overall contract services was, it was really cost aided by lower repairs, lower contract services by the rating in particular. So it's largely stripping costs, and we did not have as much stripping that we needed to do year-over-year. So it largely gets those two things, but it repairs, M&R and grading would be the two that I would highlight for you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nJerry Revich: Ward, can you talk about the M&A pipeline from here? Obviously, you outlined a broad range of geographic targets at the Analyst Day. How are you -- how optimistic are you on potential additional capital deployment opportunities over the next couple of quarters? And if you could, can you just comment on if you're seeing people wanting to close quicker as a result of concerns about potentially higher capital gains taxes next year.\nWard Nye: I guess several things. One, look, Tiller, if we were talking about Tiller 10 years ago, we would actually beginning a lot of details on Tiller because it would have been material to this company 10 years ago. It's not material today. So Tiller, a very nice acquisition, but having done Tiller number one, it's important to state that, that doesn't do anything to draw down our firepower for the rest of the year. So let's start with that notion. So we've done one. It's completely consistent with SOAR, and we like it very much. Number two, the pipeline of deals that we're looking at is a pretty robust pipeline right now. And I will share with you some of them are larger than tiller. Some of them are smaller than to so it's impossible to know exactly how any of those will go. I think our team has consistently had a very disciplined approach to M&A. That's what you will continue to see us do. I do think we were very clear in outlining areas in which we wanted to grow during Analyst and Investor Day and making sure that we went to those markets where we did not have a leading position and seeing if we could find a way to a leading position in those markets what's important. And again, that's completely consistent with what we did in Tiller.  With respect to timing, I'm not necessarily seeing people wanting to get things closed necessarily faster. I think most of them are more focused on either generational changes within a company or they're focused with a different strategy that they may be looking toward. Everybody is focused, as you would imagine, that's our week on value. And so the conversations around that are important. Equally are the synergies that we feel like we can pull out of transaction. So obviously, we're measuring those very carefully. And I think if we go back over time and look at the value that we've been able to deliver, whether it was on TXI or River for the Rockies or what we did with Bluegrass or otherwise. I think our track record there is good, and it's certainly our hope to be busy on the M&A front for the rest of the year. But what I would suggest to you in that respect is there's more to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David McGregor of Longbow Research. Your question please. \nDavid McGregor: Congrats on the good quarter. You laid out your market mix earlier, just talking about infrastructure, nonres and res and the percentages that would correspond with each just wondering how that may vary from what you've got built into your guidance for 2021? And just if you could talk about how you see that mix migrating over the balance of the year that would be helpful.\nWard Nye: Yes. No. Look, I think several things are pretty clear. I think infrastructure is going to become increasingly better. And I would say that because if we're looking at our top five states, which again, are going to be over 70% of our revenue. When we think about what that looks like. I mean Texas FY 2021 letting levels of $1.5 billion from a tech top perspective is a 22% increase from where it was in 2020, and that's a very attractive number. Equally, if we look at NCDOT, their FY 2021 blending schedules are projected at $1.3 billion, and that's up from $670 million. So again, those are big movements. And even , which you know David, has long had a very attractive infrastructure budget is indicating higher learnings this year and they're emphasizing projects that they feel like are ready to go. So if we come back to a couple of states that are also important to us, Georgia and Colorado, those states, we're seeing is relatively flat year-over-year. But I think something that's worth keeping in mind is a lot of the COVID-19 economic relief that went to the dots are about to find their way into the system as well. So keep in mind, Colorado got $134 million in that process. And Georgia got $323 million in that process. So we think infrastructure is going to continue to get increasingly attractive. And depending on what happens in D.C., it could really become increasingly attractive next year. I think the thing that will continue to be moved by is how solid the non-res market is. And you can see it in the percentages that we talked about in today's release, the market for industrial, logistics and data center facilities continues to flourish. And clearly, that's benefiting from the critical role that these facilities play in supporting business operations, and we think we're incredibly well positioned to serve markets like Atlanta, DFW, Austin, San Antonio, Des Moines, Omaha, Indianapolis and others. What's important there, though, David, is we're seeing what we thought we would see, but we're seeing it modestly earlier. And that is, if you recall, when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, our view was we thought we would start to see some green shoots in light non-res and have to. I think the words we used where we thought we would start to see that inflect then we still do. But what's encouraging is we're seeing some of that in some markets even earlier than we would have thought. So for example, if we're looking in Atlanta today, clearly, Atlanta is seeing a significant uptick in corporate relocations and expansions, which plays well into the light piece of it. Equally, Colorado is seeing good light commercial in office and retail, and that's starting to pick up now. And that's an area that we knew would come because it's going to follow housing with a lag, we just thought the lag might be a little bit longer. And then importantly, as we're looking at residential today, we think Martin Marietta with the Southeast, Southwestern footprint. Is particularly well positioned to benefit from what's happening with housing. So again, if we put housing in context, the 30-year average for single-family starts is $1 million. So if we consider that a 3 is a key threshold for what we think is normalized aggregates focused demand, where we think we're going to be for the next several years. And that dimension is pretty exciting because we talked about at the Analyst Investor Day that there's a correlation between single-family starts and aggregates intensity with a 1 year lag, that's at about 99%. And if you look at the March 2021 seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing in the United States for single family starts, it was at $1.2 million. And again, the last time we saw numbers like that, were back in 2007 and back in 2001. And by the way, we like the way the market was looking at both of those times. So I think infrastructure is clearly getting better we think non-res and the heavy sign is attractive right now, but we think light is getting better. And we think housing, but in particular, single-family housing in Martin Marietta markets is really being held back only by availability today. And again, when we're trying to rank problems, David, that's probably a high-class problem.\nOperator: Next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nGarik Shmois: Given some of the midyear price increase opportunities you cited, particularly in aggregates and given the inflationary environment that you're in, or just curious how we should think about the cadence of pricing that, yes, the rest of the year and I know we're not into 2022 yet, but should we anticipate a breakout in price growth potentially next year?\nWard Nye: Yes, Garik, just to be clear, when I was speaking to the aggregates piece of it, I think what I said was I thought we might see some discrete wins on a size by size basis, specific tight in some markets. And clearly, the cement commentary that I offered was different than that because we are already seeing tightness in a very large market in Texas. But back to your commentary, what we've long said is pricing on a percentage tends to follow volume to a degree on a percentage with a bit of a lag.  So Garik, if you're looking at the marketplace, and you're saying, look, I know you've got a markup going on in-house T&I on an infrastructure bill. You've got a markup going on in Senate EPW on an infrastructure bill. It looks like something is going to happen. It looks like something is going to happen this year. It looks like whatever that something is, is likely to be the biggest something that we've seen in 15 years. I think that bodes well. If we go back to the commentary that I was just offering to David, in his question relative to non-res and res, we think that's probably pretty healthy too.  So I think coming back to the proposition that you're offering, if the volume is going to be there, I do think it gives the opportunity for there to be pricing ahead of what we've seen over the last several years because keep in mind, that's been very much in a volume muted environment. So the pricing that we just offered you through the course of this conversation is with aggregate volume is actually down 3% in the quarter. And by the way, we anticipated that. So I think the proposition that you've offered is right. I think there's still more to watch and more to come, but I have a hard time thinking that what you posed isn't, where we would think about it, Garik.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Ward, can you comment on the multiple you paid for Tiller or give us any kind of a sense for your net debt after closing the deal?\nWard Nye: What I'll do more of the latter than the former. And because, as I said, if Tiller had been 10 years ago, it would have been material, and we would talk about it. Obviously, this is a transaction we've done with the family, and we have nondisclosure obligations that we want to remain confident. I mean, secure around -- I will turn it over to Jim because what you'll hear is despite the fact that we've done what would have been a very notable transaction a decade ago. We're still in a very attractive spot. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Yes, this really doesn't meaningfully change our debt-to-EBITDA leverage, Adam. We're still just south of our 2 times to 2.5 times target zone. So this really will not be much of an impact for our M&A pipeline and executing on that going forward. Our liquidity is great. Cash flow is good and improving. And as we mentioned, this deal is accretive to earnings and cash flow in year 1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Wilson of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJosh Wilson: I wanted to come at the ag markets just 1 more time, and I appreciate 1Q is an unusual quarter. But if you could just quantify for us some of the good guys and bad guys there since you were up 500 basis points from basically flat dollars, just so we can get a sense of the size of which ones are sustainable and which aren't. And maybe if you could quantify diesel fuel going forward as well. So we can have a flavor for that, that would be helpful.\nWard Nye: Yes. Let me do this. Let me ask Jim to come back and address some of the very specific puts and takes on that, and I'll give you some broad commentary afterwards.\nJim Nickolas: Okay. Yes. So Josh, the most sustainable the good guys, as you call it, for the quarter, was price. That's something that's our own front. That's $19 million of benefit this quarter. One of the bad guys was volume down 3%. That was about $5 million of profit impact. The rest are good guys. So internal freight expense improved by $6 million. Again, that depends on end markets, it depends where that makes stay works at. It may grow again if we have higher sales to yards, contract services improved by $5 million, repairs expense improved by $3.5 million personal expense improved by $2 million. Diesel expense improved by just under $1 million, so basically neutral, but almost across the board improved lower expenses for the quarter.\nWard Nye: So Josh, if we think about -- with the background of that, what we're likely to see going forward, I would say several things. If you're looking for things that will be a headwind. I think the biggest single headwind the industry will likely face will be diesel fuel. So remember last year, energy was quite low. But if we think about what we're seeing, we think pricing is going to continue to be very attractive for us. We think geographic mix is likely to be attractive for us this year because keep in mind, we had a record year last year with North Carolina really sitting on the bench. And North Carolina is not sitting on the bench at all anymore. We equally believe that our aggregates business in Texas and our cement business in Texas is going to perform very, very well this year. We think Colorado is going to have a very attractive year. The only thing that's wrong in Colorado in '21 is that Colorado had a superb '20. So keep in mind, they had a very wet '19 that deferred work from '19 into '20. And then they literally had the perfect storm in '20 with beautiful weather and a late winter setting in so I think Jim is giving you a good sense, of course, some of the good guys and bad guys are. I think there are a lot more good guys than bad guys. So I think one more good guy, I want to make sure we call out because they really don't get the credit that they deserve is what we think is happening with respect to Magnesia Specialties as well. And again, this is a real differentiator for Martin Marietta, Q1 revenues of $65 million represents almost a 9% increase over the prior year. And that's led by what Jim was referring to earlier, so it's a nice year research and steel industry. So if we're looking at domestic steel, that's rebounded now to 78% capacity keep in mind, when we were about half year last year, that was a 51% utilization. So again, we're seeing even in that line of our business, a very nice recovery and we're seeing record Q1 gross profit in that business. But importantly, we're seeing record margin percentages in that business that correspond with what it was seeing a year ago in Q1. So we feel like both on the Magnesia Specialties business and the materials business, we're at a very attractive place where there's going to be more of this goodness that goes forward, then we're going to get back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nMichael Dudas: The -- thinking about the release -- the COVID release money that's starting to get out and probably be more factored in later this year. Are you anticipating -- because there's some discretion from state governments on that? Or are you anticipating a portion or a good portion or a little portion of that falling into the '22 fiscal year budgets? And then when you think about layering in, let's open eventual fast back renewal and big successful infrastructure bill somehow. Is that going to also influence like how you think about what the opportunity is going to be for '22, '23 and beyond, because that seems to be a lot of capital flowing into the markets that could be coming pretty tight at then?\nWard Nye: No. Look, we agree. And the short answer is, look, if we look that $10 billion of the COVID economic release that's already out there. We talked about some of the dollars that had gone specifically to places like Georgia, $323 million and in Colorado. And I mean, to put some more context to it, if we look at Texas, that was not $114 million, North Carolina $260 million, in Florida $473 million even in a state like Indiana, $238 million. So these are dollars that can move needles. Answer to number one, do we see that a decent piece of it going late '21 or into '22, I think the answer is yes, we do. Do we think we're going to see a new highway build at notably higher numbers, either through the reauthorization process or other processes, we believe that we will. We think that will likely impact '22, but we think that's probably likely to be even more impactful by the time we get to '23. Now with respect to the ability to meet what that need is going to be, I would say, several things: One, contractors have been hiring because they had the ability to hire during periods of time when labor was tighter in other places. So we believe contractors are going to be in a position to meet this amped up need in an appropriate and responsible ways. Importantly, from a material supply perspective, what I can tell you is we have a business that would have the ability should we need to put about 250 million tons of material on the ground. And if you look at what we produced and sold last year, I'd say it was 180-some materials -- tons of materials. So our ability to ramp up, if we needed to, is there. It's present. And what's important to state, and I think this goes back to the essence of your question, Mike, we would not have to put notable capital in to do it. We might have to run some longer hours to do it. But we could certainly do that without having to go deep to the well on CapEx. So I hope that helps.\nMichael Dudas: Yes. That's what I was leading to. Certainly, the operating leverage is quite there. Do you have a gut feel whether it's going to be reconciliation or fast back renewal or brand-new bipartisan opportunity?\nWard Nye: That's a great question. And the only thing I can tell us we can all that and we'll probably all be wrong in some respect. I think this is one that they're likely to find a bipartisan way to do. And I think if they do it's going to be a lot more highways, bridges and roads focused than some of the administration proposals that are out there. I think if they can find a way to make it more infrastructure in the way you and I would define infrastructure. There's a way towards a bipartisan agreement. I think if it can't be more focused on that, then I think reconciliation and other methodology comes into play in a more significant way. But again, as I'm looking at markups that are underway in both EPW and the Senate and T&I in the house right now, there's a reason that they're marking that up, and there's the reason that I think they want to have Mark Ups out by Memorial Day. And I think there'll be more to come, but I think we'll find bipartisan agreement on this if I'm betting that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger of Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nWard Nye: Paul, are you there?\nOperator: Mr. Roger, please make sure your line isn't muted, and if you are not, speak the phone with your handset.\nPaul Roger: Yes. That was a scoop again. Apologies for that, guys. Apologies Congratulations on the start.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Paul. Good to hear your voice.\nPaul Roger: Yes, likewise. So conscious will obviously come into the end of the call. Now I'll maybe take a slightly different track and ask about the green agenda. I mean, clearly, the environmental agendas going up in the U.S. Can you speak a bit broadly about risks and opportunities that creates for you? And then maybe specifically, are you at all concerned that we could see an increase in the use of recycled aggregate at the expense of some higher margin product?\nWard Nye: Look, you're right, ESG is clearly taking up a new form of debate, both in the United States and as you're well aware, internationally. I would say several things. I do think there are opportunities for Martin Marietta as we go through that. Number one, I think resilient construction is going to be an important part of any dialogue relative to ESG. And I think we can demonstrate that the types of constructions in which we will participate tend to meet that criteria, number one. Number two, if we're looking at wind farms and wind generation of power, one of the things that we called out specifically last year, we were seeing -- I think it was in Q4 tonnage was down over 1 million tons just in our Midwest Division because we had seen that division not having as much tonnage go out to wind energy projects because some tax credits that historically had been in place had expired. So we're seeing more tax credits going toward wind energy, and we believe that we will. We think the opportunities are there for that. I think another area of focus is likely to be relative to water and into infrastructure that's underground. And I think people are particularly sensitive to degrees of water that communities are simply losing on a year in, year out basis, we think our products are going to be vitally important in that as well. Now with respect to green and recycle and how that's going to work in different markets and the degree to which recycle concrete or otherwise could become more ubiquitous. I would offer several things. One, specifications are still going to be drawn up by, obviously, our friends at ASTM, the federal government in different state DOT\u2019s.  Keep in mind, cross stone is an essential element in the manufacturer of ready mix concrete. It's essential in hub mix asphalt. At least in the recycled asphalt paving that we see. The primary component of recycle that's valuable to contractors and that, it's not so much the stone but rather the bitumen or the liquid asphalt that's in that. So we think we'll continue to see that. But even most state DOT\u2019s that are aggressive with what can be used on wrap or recycled asphalt saving, it's 25% or 30%. And so we don't think that's going to be a significant replacement for aggregates. And equally, while you can have certain degrees of crushed concrete that can serve as a commercial base. In most instances, it will still not meet a clean stone specification for use in heavy highway airport or other work. The other thing to remember, Paul, and this is so important. And that is despite the fact that our company has seen a nice increase and a steady increase in pricing over time. We're still selling aggregates on average for, let's call it, $14, $15 a ton. It's very difficult to have even a green product that can substitute for aggregates, that's going to be a cost-effective product in that respect because even when people are utilizing recycled concrete, oftentimes, there's rebar in that concrete, which means the crushing process tends to be quite complicated. So you asked me what time it was. I probably told you how to build a clock, but it's a great question, and it's complicated. It's something we've given a lot of thought to, but we have a lot of resilience around the view that this is an industry that is here for a long time.\nPaul Roger: That's great. I mean, I think there's a perception that sometimes U.S. companies like. So it's nice you've got a good story itself.\nWard Nye: Well, Paul, thank you so much for that. The other thing that I would remind you, we put out our sustainability report literally last week that gives a good overview of exactly how Martin Marietta is approaching ESG issues. So thank you so much for your comment on that.\nWard Nye: As I understand it, that's the end of our questions today. So what I'll do at this point is thank you all for joining today's earnings call. In short, we believe our company is superbly positioned to create substantial long-term shareholder value. Supported by our differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review, Martin Marietta is poised to drive substantial growth in 2021 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2021 results in just a few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta please stay safe and stay healthy. Take care. Goodbye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. As evidenced by our first quarter results and successful targeted growth initiatives, it's clear that Martin Marietta is off to an impressive start in 2021. Thanks to the company's differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review plan, what we refer to as SOAR, we remain well positioned for continued success. As we look to the remainder of 2021 and beyond, we expect to build on a track record of strong financial, operational, integrated and safety performance. Supported by our team's steadfast commitment to safe and efficient operations, price discipline and operational excellence, we established first quarter records for revenues, profits and safety. Both building materials and magnesia specialties benefited from strengthening product demand. Specifically, consolidated products and services revenues increased 3% to $922 million, consolidated gross profit increased 23% to $175 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased of 37% to $204 million and diluted earnings per share grew over 2.5 times to $1.04. We also achieved the best first quarter safety performance in Martin Marietta's history with company-wide lost time and total injury incident rates exceeding or trending at world class levels. At the same time, we are thoughtfully executing on our SOAR growth priorities to enhance our geographic footprint and grow our business. As announced in this morning's release, we successfully completed the acquisition of Tiller Corporation the leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis St. Paul region and welcomed more than 200 talented employees to the Martin Marietta team. Tiller provides an upstream materials platform in one of the largest and fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the Midwest and expands and complements the product offerings of our existing operations in surrounding markets. Tillers cultural fit, attracted margins and value over volume operating philosophy directly aligned with our central division operations. We expect a seamless and successful integration. Now let's turn to the company's first quarter operating performance. The Building Materials business saw strengthening product demand from single-family housing growth, infrastructure investment and notable heavy industrial projects of scale in our key geographies. Our aggregates, Cement and ready mixed concrete business in Texas, our largest revenue-generating state experienced temporary disruptions from February's historic winter ice storm and sub freezing temperatures. Additionally, our aggregates and downstream operations in Colorado, our second largest state by revenues, faced a challenging comparison as our results in the same period last year, benefited from unseasonably favorable weather conditions in the Rocky mountains. Overall, aggregate shipments declined 3%, in line with our expectations, given return to typical first quarter seasonality factors and the largely non-COVID-19 impacted prior year quarter. Notably, East Group aggregate shipments increased as the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Maryland, benefited from strong residential and heavy industrial nonresidential activity. This growth offset lower shipments in the Midwest from more seasonal construction activity and reduced wind energy projects. While underlying product demand remains robust, unfavorable winter weather conditions in both Texas and Colorado and a softer energy sector market resulted in an 8% decline in West group shipments. Aggregates average selling price increased 3.4% or 2.5% on a mix adjusted basis. These pricing gains supported by our locally driven pricing strategy, highlight contractor confidence and underlying construction activity in the attractive markets that we serve. East Group pricing increased 4% with both East and Central divisions contributing solid growth geographic mix from a lower percentage of higher-priced long-haul shipments limited to West Group's pricing gain to 2%. Our cement business delivered strong first quarter operating performance and shipment growth despite the disruptions from February's historic high storm, I'm extremely grateful to our teams, their actions to proactively winterize and take our plants offline, allowed us to quickly return to normal production capacity post storm. To that effect, our cement operations established an all-time record from monthly shipments in March, demonstrating the robust demand and construction activity throughout the Texas triangle. Mix adjusted pricing grew 2% during the quarter. Annual cement prices went into effect April 1 and have garnered widespread support in both North and South Texas. We expect our Cement business will continue to benefit from favorable market trends supported by continued market type as in Texas and diversified customer backlogs. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Our ready-mix concrete operations established a first quarter record for shipments, which increased nearly 27% to 2 million cubic yards. Large nonresidential projects and incremental volume from operations acquired late last year contributed to double-digit shipment growth in Texas, which more than offset weather-related shipment declines in Colorado. Concrete pricing declined 2%, reflecting geographic mix from a higher percentage of lower-priced Texas shipments. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from a return to more typical winter weather conditions versus the prior year period, resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. As well pricing, however, improved 8%. Colorado market fundamentals remained strong, supported by healthy bidding activity and overall customer optimism. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and accelerating long-term secular trends across our three primary end-use markets will drive sustainable construction led, aggregates intensive growth for the foreseeable future. We are encouraged by the recent initial gold steps to advance much needed infrastructure investment and a general consensus for success or legislation to the fixing America's surface transportation, or Fast Act in the coming months. With both congressional chambers working on their own reauthorization proposals, we're optimistic that a Fast Act replacement and increased funding levels will be passed before its expiration in September generating meaningful shipment benefits in 2022 and beyond. In the meantime, state and local infrastructure funding remains resilient. Estimated fiscal 2021 lettings for our top five state departments of transportations or DOT's, are currently above or near prior year levels. Keep in mind, our top five states, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, are disproportionately important to our business, representing 71% of total revenues for our 2020 building materials business. For reference, aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market accounted for 30% of first quarter shipments, well below our 10-year historical average of 43%. The nonresidential construction continues to benefit from increased investment in aggregates intensive heavy industrial warehouses and data centers, broadly offsetting weakness in the more COVID-19 impacted like commercial and retail sectors. Light nonresidential activity should benefit from the attractive drag along effects of strong single-family residential growth in the longer term, in some regions, we're now seeing early signs of that recovery. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market accounted for 37% of first quarter shipments. Martin Marietta's leading southeastern and southwestern footprint positions our company to benefit from single-family housing growth given underbuilt conditions, favorable population and employment dynamics, land availability, mild climates and lower cost of living in these regions. Importantly, single-family housing is 2 times to 3 times where aggregates intensive than multifamily construction given the ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure needs to build out new suburban communities. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 27% of first quarter shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our first quarter financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we are extremely proud of our record first quarter results and industry-leading safety performance. Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on emerging growth trends that are expected to support sustainable construction activity both in the near and long term. As we SOAR to a sustainable future, we will continue to build on the foundation that has proven so successful, an aggregates led growth platform, an unwavering commitment to disciplined pricing, operational excellence and safety and solid execution of our proven strategy. We're confident in Martin Marietta's outlook for the balance of 2021 and our ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value creation in 2021 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. I thank you and congratulations on team that you built at TRG. Kathryn, again, congratulations to you and your team. I guess, a couple of things. One, the guidance that we've reaffirmed this morning is simply our heritage guidance. So again, we've given you revenue and EBITDA numbers for Tiller which you would need to go and add, obviously, to the heritage guidance to get what the effective guidance would be today. So that math is there. It's very easy to do. And the other thing that we've not done is changed guidance for the year here based on Q1. So remember, we're in an outdoor sport, and this has been January, February and March, and our view was changing it after those three months feels a bit premature to us. And again, I think we came out with guidance at the beginning of the year that was modestly ahead of where others have come out as well. So I think we have seen some degrees of guidance change today. But I think in many respects, it's been an effort to more balance where we were when we came out at the beginning of the year. So that's where we are relative to heritage guidance, please to add to that, what we've given you with respect to Tiller. As Jim said in his prepared remarks, we will come back at half year and revisit guidance. One of the things, obviously, I think we'll be revisiting will be what is happening with cement. As you know, Katherine, that's the second part of your question. We only have cement in Texas. And I'll draw several things to your attention. Number one, if we're looking at our backlogs in cement, the backlog in cement year-over-year are actually up pretty considerably. We're seeing cement tons up 24%. So number one, that's a nice takeaway.  Number two, the results that we turned in for the first quarter were despite the fact that, that business was effectively shut down for 11 days in February when Texas up with some unseasonably cold weather. We incurred about $7 million of expenses in semi business tied directly to energy and other pure production costs. We also had some inefficiencies that came from that. That ended up giving us effectively nearly a $14 million headwind, simply driven by that 11-day period. The other thing that I'll point out is, obviously, we do have a price increase that went into effect on April 1 that's at $8 a ton in that marketplace.  The other thing that we have done, recognizing that it's going to be tight in Texas this year on cement. We have put out a letter in the marketplace, and we've let our customers know that we're anticipating another $8 a ton price increase in September. So again, as we come back and give you some very specific answers to your question on cement and then ticking and tying that back to the guidance question. These are all a number of the variables that we will take into account as we revisit guidance at half year. I'll happy to. You led off with the right thing about is, look, we see this. It's accretive to cash and earnings in year 1. That's a nice place to start when we're thinking Tiller. If we think about to the SOAR process, keep in mind, we've long said that we have a leading position in 90% of our markets. Would that lead you to conclude that in 10% of the markets were not 1 or 2 this was 1 of the 10% of the markets. So again, we like the Minneapolis, St. Paul Marketplace. We wanted to be a leader in that marketplace. Through our SOAR process, we had identified Minneapolis, St. Paul as an MSA in which we wanted to grow. We had identified Tiller specifically as a target that we wanted to see if we could bring into Martin Marietta. And there are several reasons for that. Number one, if we look at Minneapolis, St. Paul, it's the 12th largest MSA in terms of aggregate consumption in the United States. So one of the things that got my attention was when I saw that they're actually more aggregates consumed in Minneapolis, St. Paul, than there are in Charlotte, which was not something that I think is intuitive to a lot of people. The other thing that's worth noting is Minnesota maintains the nation's fifth largest highway system, and they've got a budget of about $3.8 billion, and about 90% of that goes to highways purchasing roads. So we like the way that they invest in that place.  The other thing that I would say is this is a leading upstream business. It's aggregates led. It does have hot mix, but I want to be really clear here, Trey. It's not a laid out business. They're producing Blacktop that's basically being sold to contractors. So historically, Tiller has operated through a couple of subsidiaries, Barton Sanda Gravel, and that's literally their Sandy Gravel business and then a business called Commercial Asphalt. So those two businesses really comprise what they have. It's about 15-plus sites in the twin cities area. They've got a 30-year average pot life at their different locations. And again, they have an EBITDA there that learns very, very nicely with what we have in the central division. So back to SOAR, back to leading positions and in markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near-term and long term, that's what Tiller brings this organization. The other thing that I would say is, philosophically, the organizations are extraordinarily well aligned. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we closed on that Friday, and we were absolutely thrilled to bring several hundred people from Tiller into the Martin Marietta organization track. Look, Phil, I would say it's really more the latter than the former. And that is -- don't be too linear just looking at what's out there. What I would say is we're not updating guidance right now simply because it's Q1. Obviously, we're very excited about what we saw in Q1. We're really excited about the fact that places like North Carolina VOT are back. The other thing that we're seeing in Q1 that I think we'll continue to see through the year as price fell through very, very nicely. You saw that. The other thing that I think we know we saw in Q1 was very good cost performance. I anticipate that we will continue to see good cost performance throughout the year. I think that's where you can have some degrees of give and take. The fact was diesel is likely to become an increasing headwind as we go through the year. Frankly, in Q1, it wasn't much of a headwind. It wasn't much of a tailwind either, but if we look at some of the cost buckets in which we saw a nice outperformance year-over-year, freight, moving material from a producing location to a yard was actually nicely better year-over-year.  Now if we see more sales going out of sales yards as the year goes on, obviously, that freight number would move. So with revenue, a number of things have moved with that. What I'll tell you as well as contract services were down. In other words, there were some stripping and other components that were down. Repairs were down, and we think those are likely the types of things that we will be able to hold on to. And I think that's evidence of good capital spend. Equally, we saw lower personnel costs. If you recall, last year, we did do some restructuring that was not necessarily COVID related, the timing of it just worked out very, very nicely. So what I would encourage you not to do is, again, take the guidance that we've not changed and then just assume everything continues in a linear fashion. Again, that's why we want to come back at half year and address it.  But again, I like the pricing dynamics that we're seeing in both aggregates and in cement. I think our teams have done an extraordinary job relative to costs. Again, if you're looking at gross profit per ton in the quarter, and you saw that going up at 34.5%. And if you're looking cash gross profit per ton to growth, I mean, we were almost 23% on that from what I can tell that looks like best-in-class types of metrics. So again, we're -- we feel very good about where we sit right now. And to be clear, we feel good about the balance of the year. I'll address more pricing than I will, April last year, Stan, as you recall, we actually did talk a little bit about the quarters ahead, and we were being encouraged to do that by the SEC and others because it was such an extraordinary period of time. And as you know, our view typically is to live very tightly within the quarters. And we were doing that in large part because people were removing guidance last year. So I won't go into April, per se. I will say, clearly, there was nice momentum coming into Q1. Relative to pricing, but I would say is there are no surprises. On the aggregates piece of it, it's working exactly the way that we would have anticipated and the way that we planned. You saw the breakdown between reported and mix adjusted, as we talked about the quarter, again, reported up 3.4%, mix adjusted at 2.5%. Again, that's very much within the guide that we've given. I do think it's possible this year that you might see some aggregate tightness in certain markets on certain sizes. It's hard to tell at this moment, but I certainly think that, that's possible. If we see some of that, I think we could see some very discrete price changes maybe on a size basis later in the year. All of that's relative to aggregates.  If we're speaking of cement, it's obviously a different circumstance. So keep in mind, this is not a nationwide cement business. This is a Texas Cement business. Cement is tight in Texas. We feel very good about the $8 increase that we put into effect on April 1. We expect all of that, for example, the stick in the North Texas market. We think most of that is going to stick in the central market as well. And again, as I think I indicated before, our intention -- stated intention, published intention by letters to our customers is another $8 a ton price increase on September 1 and to give you a sense of it, that's going to be the first midyear that we believe that market is going to see since 2014. So I think that gives you a good sense of at least the degree of confidence that we have in pricing in that market standing. No, Timna, I appreciate the question. If we go through our business, we're not seeing significant hits from inflation as we look at it again. So if we think about the buckets that will be cost for us, our single biggest bucket is going to be personnel. I mean the biggest thing that we're going to be able to flex there is what overtime hours look like in some markets because we largely have the teams in place that we need to put the material on the ground. The other thing that on some occasions, can be a bit of a challenge in some circumstances be freight, as we indicated in the first quarter, freight was actually down because we're seeing less moved by rail. I mean, if that goes up later in the year, what I would suggest to you is that's probably going to be a relatively high-class problem. So we're certainly not concerned about that. Again, we've got a good set of vendors. We have a good supply chain in place. Most of our supply chain is domestic. We think that very much cuts in our favor. So again, as we're looking at our overall cost profile, Timna so I'm very happy to report to you. We don't see anything on the cost profile that we feel like is going to be anything in a particular moment. I'll turn it to Jim to see if he has anything he'd like to add to that. What I think the primary thing, overall contract services was, it was really cost aided by lower repairs, lower contract services by the rating in particular. So it's largely stripping costs, and we did not have as much stripping that we needed to do year-over-year. So it largely gets those two things, but it repairs, M&R and grading would be the two that I would highlight for you. I guess several things. One, look, Tiller, if we were talking about Tiller 10 years ago, we would actually beginning a lot of details on Tiller because it would have been material to this company 10 years ago. It's not material today. So Tiller, a very nice acquisition, but having done Tiller number one, it's important to state that, that doesn't do anything to draw down our firepower for the rest of the year. So let's start with that notion. So we've done one. It's completely consistent with SOAR, and we like it very much. Number two, the pipeline of deals that we're looking at is a pretty robust pipeline right now. And I will share with you some of them are larger than tiller. Some of them are smaller than to so it's impossible to know exactly how any of those will go. I think our team has consistently had a very disciplined approach to M&A. That's what you will continue to see us do. I do think we were very clear in outlining areas in which we wanted to grow during Analyst and Investor Day and making sure that we went to those markets where we did not have a leading position and seeing if we could find a way to a leading position in those markets what's important. And again, that's completely consistent with what we did in Tiller.  With respect to timing, I'm not necessarily seeing people wanting to get things closed necessarily faster. I think most of them are more focused on either generational changes within a company or they're focused with a different strategy that they may be looking toward. Everybody is focused, as you would imagine, that's our week on value. And so the conversations around that are important. Equally are the synergies that we feel like we can pull out of transaction. So obviously, we're measuring those very carefully. And I think if we go back over time and look at the value that we've been able to deliver, whether it was on TXI or River for the Rockies or what we did with Bluegrass or otherwise. I think our track record there is good, and it's certainly our hope to be busy on the M&A front for the rest of the year. But what I would suggest to you in that respect is there's more to come. Yes. No. Look, I think several things are pretty clear. I think infrastructure is going to become increasingly better. And I would say that because if we're looking at our top five states, which again, are going to be over 70% of our revenue. When we think about what that looks like. I mean Texas FY 2021 letting levels of $1.5 billion from a tech top perspective is a 22% increase from where it was in 2020, and that's a very attractive number. Equally, if we look at NCDOT, their FY 2021 blending schedules are projected at $1.3 billion, and that's up from $670 million. So again, those are big movements. And even , which you know David, has long had a very attractive infrastructure budget is indicating higher learnings this year and they're emphasizing projects that they feel like are ready to go. So if we come back to a couple of states that are also important to us, Georgia and Colorado, those states, we're seeing is relatively flat year-over-year. But I think something that's worth keeping in mind is a lot of the COVID-19 economic relief that went to the dots are about to find their way into the system as well. So keep in mind, Colorado got $134 million in that process. And Georgia got $323 million in that process. So we think infrastructure is going to continue to get increasingly attractive. And depending on what happens in D.C., it could really become increasingly attractive next year. I think the thing that will continue to be moved by is how solid the non-res market is. And you can see it in the percentages that we talked about in today's release, the market for industrial, logistics and data center facilities continues to flourish. And clearly, that's benefiting from the critical role that these facilities play in supporting business operations, and we think we're incredibly well positioned to serve markets like Atlanta, DFW, Austin, San Antonio, Des Moines, Omaha, Indianapolis and others. What's important there, though, David, is we're seeing what we thought we would see, but we're seeing it modestly earlier. And that is, if you recall, when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year, our view was we thought we would start to see some green shoots in light non-res and have to. I think the words we used where we thought we would start to see that inflect then we still do. But what's encouraging is we're seeing some of that in some markets even earlier than we would have thought. So for example, if we're looking in Atlanta today, clearly, Atlanta is seeing a significant uptick in corporate relocations and expansions, which plays well into the light piece of it. Equally, Colorado is seeing good light commercial in office and retail, and that's starting to pick up now. And that's an area that we knew would come because it's going to follow housing with a lag, we just thought the lag might be a little bit longer. And then importantly, as we're looking at residential today, we think Martin Marietta with the Southeast, Southwestern footprint. Is particularly well positioned to benefit from what's happening with housing. So again, if we put housing in context, the 30-year average for single-family starts is $1 million. So if we consider that a 3 is a key threshold for what we think is normalized aggregates focused demand, where we think we're going to be for the next several years. And that dimension is pretty exciting because we talked about at the Analyst Investor Day that there's a correlation between single-family starts and aggregates intensity with a 1 year lag, that's at about 99%. And if you look at the March 2021 seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing in the United States for single family starts, it was at $1.2 million. And again, the last time we saw numbers like that, were back in 2007 and back in 2001. And by the way, we like the way the market was looking at both of those times. So I think infrastructure is clearly getting better we think non-res and the heavy sign is attractive right now, but we think light is getting better. And we think housing, but in particular, single-family housing in Martin Marietta markets is really being held back only by availability today. And again, when we're trying to rank problems, David, that's probably a high-class problem. Yes, Garik, just to be clear, when I was speaking to the aggregates piece of it, I think what I said was I thought we might see some discrete wins on a size by size basis, specific tight in some markets. And clearly, the cement commentary that I offered was different than that because we are already seeing tightness in a very large market in Texas. But back to your commentary, what we've long said is pricing on a percentage tends to follow volume to a degree on a percentage with a bit of a lag.  So Garik, if you're looking at the marketplace, and you're saying, look, I know you've got a markup going on in-house T&I on an infrastructure bill. You've got a markup going on in Senate EPW on an infrastructure bill. It looks like something is going to happen. It looks like something is going to happen this year. It looks like whatever that something is, is likely to be the biggest something that we've seen in 15 years. I think that bodes well. If we go back to the commentary that I was just offering to David, in his question relative to non-res and res, we think that's probably pretty healthy too.  So I think coming back to the proposition that you're offering, if the volume is going to be there, I do think it gives the opportunity for there to be pricing ahead of what we've seen over the last several years because keep in mind, that's been very much in a volume muted environment. So the pricing that we just offered you through the course of this conversation is with aggregate volume is actually down 3% in the quarter. And by the way, we anticipated that. So I think the proposition that you've offered is right. I think there's still more to watch and more to come, but I have a hard time thinking that what you posed isn't, where we would think about it, Garik. What I'll do more of the latter than the former. And because, as I said, if Tiller had been 10 years ago, it would have been material, and we would talk about it. Obviously, this is a transaction we've done with the family, and we have nondisclosure obligations that we want to remain confident. I mean, secure around -- I will turn it over to Jim because what you'll hear is despite the fact that we've done what would have been a very notable transaction a decade ago. We're still in a very attractive spot. Jim? Yes. Let me do this. Let me ask Jim to come back and address some of the very specific puts and takes on that, and I'll give you some broad commentary afterwards. So Josh, if we think about -- with the background of that, what we're likely to see going forward, I would say several things. If you're looking for things that will be a headwind. I think the biggest single headwind the industry will likely face will be diesel fuel. So remember last year, energy was quite low. But if we think about what we're seeing, we think pricing is going to continue to be very attractive for us. We think geographic mix is likely to be attractive for us this year because keep in mind, we had a record year last year with North Carolina really sitting on the bench. And North Carolina is not sitting on the bench at all anymore. We equally believe that our aggregates business in Texas and our cement business in Texas is going to perform very, very well this year. We think Colorado is going to have a very attractive year. The only thing that's wrong in Colorado in '21 is that Colorado had a superb '20. So keep in mind, they had a very wet '19 that deferred work from '19 into '20. And then they literally had the perfect storm in '20 with beautiful weather and a late winter setting in so I think Jim is giving you a good sense, of course, some of the good guys and bad guys are. I think there are a lot more good guys than bad guys. So I think one more good guy, I want to make sure we call out because they really don't get the credit that they deserve is what we think is happening with respect to Magnesia Specialties as well. And again, this is a real differentiator for Martin Marietta, Q1 revenues of $65 million represents almost a 9% increase over the prior year. And that's led by what Jim was referring to earlier, so it's a nice year research and steel industry. So if we're looking at domestic steel, that's rebounded now to 78% capacity keep in mind, when we were about half year last year, that was a 51% utilization. So again, we're seeing even in that line of our business, a very nice recovery and we're seeing record Q1 gross profit in that business. But importantly, we're seeing record margin percentages in that business that correspond with what it was seeing a year ago in Q1. So we feel like both on the Magnesia Specialties business and the materials business, we're at a very attractive place where there's going to be more of this goodness that goes forward, then we're going to get back. No. Look, we agree. And the short answer is, look, if we look that $10 billion of the COVID economic release that's already out there. We talked about some of the dollars that had gone specifically to places like Georgia, $323 million and in Colorado. And I mean, to put some more context to it, if we look at Texas, that was not $114 million, North Carolina $260 million, in Florida $473 million even in a state like Indiana, $238 million. So these are dollars that can move needles. Answer to number one, do we see that a decent piece of it going late '21 or into '22, I think the answer is yes, we do. Do we think we're going to see a new highway build at notably higher numbers, either through the reauthorization process or other processes, we believe that we will. We think that will likely impact '22, but we think that's probably likely to be even more impactful by the time we get to '23. Now with respect to the ability to meet what that need is going to be, I would say, several things: One, contractors have been hiring because they had the ability to hire during periods of time when labor was tighter in other places. So we believe contractors are going to be in a position to meet this amped up need in an appropriate and responsible ways. Importantly, from a material supply perspective, what I can tell you is we have a business that would have the ability should we need to put about 250 million tons of material on the ground. And if you look at what we produced and sold last year, I'd say it was 180-some materials -- tons of materials. So our ability to ramp up, if we needed to, is there. It's present. And what's important to state, and I think this goes back to the essence of your question, Mike, we would not have to put notable capital in to do it. We might have to run some longer hours to do it. But we could certainly do that without having to go deep to the well on CapEx. So I hope that helps. That's a great question. And the only thing I can tell us we can all that and we'll probably all be wrong in some respect. I think this is one that they're likely to find a bipartisan way to do. And I think if they do it's going to be a lot more highways, bridges and roads focused than some of the administration proposals that are out there. I think if they can find a way to make it more infrastructure in the way you and I would define infrastructure. There's a way towards a bipartisan agreement. I think if it can't be more focused on that, then I think reconciliation and other methodology comes into play in a more significant way. But again, as I'm looking at markups that are underway in both EPW and the Senate and T&I in the house right now, there's a reason that they're marking that up, and there's the reason that I think they want to have Mark Ups out by Memorial Day. And I think there'll be more to come, but I think we'll find bipartisan agreement on this if I'm betting that. Paul, are you there? Thank you, Paul. Good to hear your voice. Look, you're right, ESG is clearly taking up a new form of debate, both in the United States and as you're well aware, internationally. I would say several things. I do think there are opportunities for Martin Marietta as we go through that. Number one, I think resilient construction is going to be an important part of any dialogue relative to ESG. And I think we can demonstrate that the types of constructions in which we will participate tend to meet that criteria, number one. Number two, if we're looking at wind farms and wind generation of power, one of the things that we called out specifically last year, we were seeing -- I think it was in Q4 tonnage was down over 1 million tons just in our Midwest Division because we had seen that division not having as much tonnage go out to wind energy projects because some tax credits that historically had been in place had expired. So we're seeing more tax credits going toward wind energy, and we believe that we will. We think the opportunities are there for that. I think another area of focus is likely to be relative to water and into infrastructure that's underground. And I think people are particularly sensitive to degrees of water that communities are simply losing on a year in, year out basis, we think our products are going to be vitally important in that as well. Now with respect to green and recycle and how that's going to work in different markets and the degree to which recycle concrete or otherwise could become more ubiquitous. I would offer several things. One, specifications are still going to be drawn up by, obviously, our friends at ASTM, the federal government in different state DOT's.  Keep in mind, cross stone is an essential element in the manufacturer of ready mix concrete. It's essential in hub mix asphalt. At least in the recycled asphalt paving that we see. The primary component of recycle that's valuable to contractors and that, it's not so much the stone but rather the bitumen or the liquid asphalt that's in that. So we think we'll continue to see that. But even most state DOT's that are aggressive with what can be used on wrap or recycled asphalt saving, it's 25% or 30%. And so we don't think that's going to be a significant replacement for aggregates. And equally, while you can have certain degrees of crushed concrete that can serve as a commercial base. In most instances, it will still not meet a clean stone specification for use in heavy highway airport or other work. The other thing to remember, Paul, and this is so important. And that is despite the fact that our company has seen a nice increase and a steady increase in pricing over time. We're still selling aggregates on average for, let's call it, $14, $15 a ton. It's very difficult to have even a green product that can substitute for aggregates, that's going to be a cost-effective product in that respect because even when people are utilizing recycled concrete, oftentimes, there's rebar in that concrete, which means the crushing process tends to be quite complicated. So you asked me what time it was. I probably told you how to build a clock, but it's a great question, and it's complicated. It's something we've given a lot of thought to, but we have a lot of resilience around the view that this is an industry that is here for a long time. Well, Paul, thank you so much for that. The other thing that I would remind you, we put out our sustainability report literally last week that gives a good overview of exactly how Martin Marietta is approaching ESG issues. So thank you so much for your comment on that. As I understand it, that's the end of our questions today. So what I'll do at this point is thank you all for joining today's earnings call. In short, we believe our company is superbly positioned to create substantial long-term shareholder value. Supported by our differentiated business model and proven strategic operating analysis and review, Martin Marietta is poised to drive substantial growth in 2021 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2021 results in just a few months. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta please stay safe and stay healthy. Take care. Goodbye."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. We achieved the highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in Martin Marietta's history. Surpassing the previous record set in the first quarter of 2007. The Building Materials business established first quarter records for revenues and profitability. Products and services revenues increased 3% and to $857 million, while gross profit increased 25% to $148 million. We continue to drive sustainable and best-in-class aggregates unit profitability growth through the combination of price discipline and operational excellence. For the quarter, aggregates gross profit per ton shipped improved 34% to $3.28 and product gross margin expanded 490 basis points to 21.3% despite lower shipment volumes. In addition to pricing gains, lower contract services and internal freight costs contributed to these improvements. Our cement operations benefited from a 3% top line improvement. However, extended kiln downtime, reduced production levels and nearly $7 million of incremental energy and other costs all directly due to February's Texas deep freeze, led to a 1,160 basis point degradation in product gross margins. While these weather disruptions were headwinds to our first quarter results, our cement business is well positioned to benefit from growing demand and tight supply and remains on track to achieve its full year guidance. Ready mixed concrete product gross margin improved 520 basis points to 8.3%, driven by double-digit shipment growth and lower delivery and raw material costs. Magnesia specialties continued to benefit from improving domestic steel production and global demand for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $65 million, a 9% increase. Higher shipment and production levels, combined with ongoing cost management, resulted in product gross margins of 43.5% and which matched the first quarter record established in the prior year. Now a look at our cash generation and capital allocation. The first quarter was a record for cash generation. Operating cash flows of $192 million increased 80%, driven by earnings growth and a reduction in working capital. We continue to balance our disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility. Our priorities remain focused on value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. All while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. We continue to prioritize high-returning capital projects, focused on growing sales and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion. Full year capital expenditures are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million. Additionally, since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned nearly $1.9 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our first quarter earnings and cash generation were both records. As a result, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 1.8 times as of March 31, slightly below our target leverage range of 2 times to 2.5 times. As Ward highlighted, our disciplined execution of SOAR 2025 is underway. Last week, we completed the Tiller acquisition. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow and contribute $170 million of revenues and $60 million of adjusted EBITDA in the remaining 8 months of 2021. We financed the transaction using a combination of cash on our balance sheet and drawing an accounts receivable credit facility. Our full year 2021 guidance remains unchanged from the guidance provided in February and excludes the expected contribution of the Tiller acquisition. That said, we will revisit our 2021 guidance when we report our half year results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. Yes. No, the steel prices as a commodity market matter, obviously, are very elevated. We're not seeing it. We actually did a prebuy of mobile equipment from caterpillar earlier in the year. So we think we got ahead of any price increases that are coming our way. And to the extent that steel prices are inflating, plant, equipment, et cetera, we'll probably see that next year, but we're not seeing it yet this year. Yes, this really doesn't meaningfully change our debt-to-EBITDA leverage, Adam. We're still just south of our 2 times to 2.5 times target zone. So this really will not be much of an impact for our M&A pipeline and executing on that going forward. Our liquidity is great. Cash flow is good and improving. And as we mentioned, this deal is accretive to earnings and cash flow in year 1. Okay. Yes. So Josh, the most sustainable the good guys, as you call it, for the quarter, was price. That's something that's our own front. That's $19 million of benefit this quarter. One of the bad guys was volume down 3%. That was about $5 million of profit impact. The rest are good guys. So internal freight expense improved by $6 million. Again, that depends on end markets, it depends where that makes stay works at. It may grow again if we have higher sales to yards, contract services improved by $5 million, repairs expense improved by $3.5 million personal expense improved by $2 million. Diesel expense improved by just under $1 million, so basically neutral, but almost across the board improved lower expenses for the quarter."

Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that in 2022, Martin Marietta delivered our most profitable year and our 11th consecutive year of growth for consolidated products and services revenues, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. Martin Marietta also achieved a world class total injury incident rate for the second year in a row and a world class lost time incident rate for the sixth consecutive year. We delivered these record results along with platform M&A integration and multiple portfolio optimization actions amid a challenging macroeconomic setting that included a housing slowdown, monetary tightening and 40-year high inflation. Martin Marietta's accomplishments are a testament to our team's steadfast commitments to the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Most importantly, the company is well-positioned to deliver another record year in 2023. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few takeaways from the fourth quarter. While pricing growth significantly accelerated, product shipments were adversely affected by inclement weather and a number of key Martin Marietta geographies. As a reminder, we're comparing 2022 results against the fourth quarter of 2021 when we benefited from unseasonably warm and dry weather that extended the construction season late into the year. With this context, aggregates shipments decreased 12% against the prior year quarter. Yet, as we began 2023, aggregates customers' backlogs remained healthy and shipment trends thus far are ahead of planned levels. Aggregates pricing in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased a robust 16.5%, a quarterly record or 5.6% sequentially, providing attractive tailwinds into 2023. Further, despite the weather impacts on operating leverage and acceleration of certain operating expenses, pricing growth drove aggregates gross margin expansion and improved gross profit per ton shipped by 25% over the prior year quarter. In summary, for the final quarter of 2022, poor weather was a literal headwind. The 2023 stage has been set, both operationally and commercially. Now, let's turn to our full year 2022 results and the new financial records we set for an 11th consecutive year in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated products and services revenues of $5.7 billion, a 13% increase, consolidated gross profit of $1.4 billion, a 6% increase, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a 5% increase. These results underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which we successfully implemented multiple pricing actions in 2022. As a result, we achieved double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines. However, we were not immune to the rapid and significant inflationary pressures that impacted our operating costs and affected our product gross margin, which declined 160 basis points to 24.9% for the year. As an example, 2022s results included $178 million of energy cost headwinds, an over 55% increase compared with 2021. It bears repeating that inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for our upstream materials, the benefits of which long endure after inflationary pressures abate. We believe our multiple commercial actions enacted in 2022, coupled with broad customer support of our January 1st, 2023 price increases will drive meaningful pricing acceleration and margin expansion in 2023. Let's now turn to our full year operating performance, beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments increasing 3.3% to 208 million tons. Aggregate pricing fundamentals remain very attractive as pricing increased 10.6% or 10% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record yearly shipments of 4.2 million tons and pricing growth of 16.9%. We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future based on market trends and the success of our January 1st price increases. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, prior year shipment comparability for ready mixed concrete is notably impacted by last April's divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and only partially offset by our Arizona acquisition. Cumulatively, concrete shipments decreased 25.4% and pricing increased 11.3%, reflecting multiple pricing actions in the year, including fuel surcharges in order to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost increases. Asphalt shipments increased 28.4% driven by contributions from our acquired California and Arizona operations, which also impacts the prior year comparability. Pricing improved 23.6%, following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our 2023 outlook, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our 2022 discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted record products and services revenues of $5.45 billion, a 13.4% increase over last year and a product gross profit record of $1.34 billion, an 8.1% increase. Aggregates product gross profit improved 8.3% relative to the prior year, achieving a record $980 million. Aggregates product gross margin declined 160 basis points to 28%, as robust pricing growth throughout the year did not serve to offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs until the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Texas cement business delivered an all-time record top and bottom line results. Product revenues increased 21.8% to $602 million, while product gross profit increased 30.1% to $204 million. Importantly, execution of our disciplined commercial approach drove product gross margin expansion of 210 basis points to 33.9% despite significant energy cost headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. 2022 was a great year for our strategic cement business. It's worth highlighting this business growth and performance over the last three years. Since 2019, shipments are up 8%, while product revenues are up 37%. Revenue has grown over 4.5 times faster than shipments, demonstrating the team's commitment to commercial excellence. Over that same timeframe, gross profit is up 42% despite energy costs doubling. And consistent operational improvements focused on reliability and efficiency have brought increased production and higher margins. This journey of growth is far from complete. As previously disclosed, our Midlothian plant has several initiatives underway to improve production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024. The other initiatives remain on-track and have already provided additional capacity. At both the Midlothian and Hunter plants, we have largely completed converting our construction cement customers from Type 1 and Type 2 cement to the less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. The cumulative efforts of our capital expenditures at Midlothian and the conversion to Type 1L resulted in growing production volumes by 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 levels. We expect those efforts to provide an additional capacity expansion of 5% in 2023. Our ready mixed concrete product revenues declined 17% to $931 million, and product gross profit declined 27.2% to $70 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and partially offset by contributions from our acquired Arizona operations impacting prior year comparability. Increased aggregates and cement costs further weighed on gross margin, which declined 100 basis points to 7.3%. Our 2022 asphalt and paving results include the acquired California and Arizona operations impacting comparability with the prior year. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $775 million, a 50.8% increase over the prior year. Product gross profit increased $3 million to $82 million, while continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to product gross margin decline of 480 basis points to 10.6%. Magnesia Specialties generated product revenues of $278 million, a 1.2% increase over the prior year. However, higher energy, supplies and contract services expenses resulted in a product gross profit decline of 13.5% of $96 million, and product gross margin compression of 580 basis points to 34.4%. Our full year energy expense was $178 million or 55% higher than the prior year and diesel fuel accounted for approximately half of that cost increase. While diesel cost increases moderated in the fourth quarter, they remained a headwind. Our 2023 guidance assumes that the cost per gallon of diesel falls only modestly from current elevated levels. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business while also returning capital to shareholders. In 2022, we returned $309 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As a reminder, in August 2022, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. In October, the Federal Trade Commission issued a second request for information related to this pending transaction and we continue to work towards closing this matter in a timely manner. At December 31st, 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times after a year of robust M&A activity. In 2022, our stated focus was on integrating these new operations into our business, executing portfolio enhancing divestitures and deleveraging to within the Company's targeted range. As a result, we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by year's end. Exiting the year with a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investments in attractive upstream acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks Jim. We're finally enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we build upon the foundation established in 2022. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to support multiyear demand for our products across infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors, thereby improving the durability of our business through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Starting first with infrastructure. The value of state and local governments highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator of future demand, grew 24% to a record $102 billion in 2022. By comparison, the compounded annual growth rate for combined highway and bridge awards from 2018 through 2021, was 1.7%. State Departments of Transportation or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states remain robustly funded with budgets all above or in line with prior year levels and are well-positioned from a resource aspect and desire perspective to deploy the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. In addition to the multiyear funding from the IIJA in December 2022, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package. Included in the package is the Cornyn-Padilla amendment allowing states and local municipalities to use unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. It's estimated this alone will provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding for Martin Marietta's top 10 states. Importantly, investments in our nation's infrastructure maintains broad public support. During the November 2022 election, voters nationwide approved 87% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $23 billion of additional infrastructure funding. A few notable funding initiatives include $15 billion in Texas, $3 billion in San Francisco, $1.3 billion in South Carolina, through a sales tax addition and $1 billion in Colorado, through the renewal of a sales tax addition. We expect this significantly enhanced level of federal, state and local infrastructure investment to yield multiyear demand for our products in this important counter-cyclical end market and drive aggregates shipments to infrastructure closer to our 10-year historical average of 39% of total shipments, as compared to 35% in 2022. Moving now to nonresidential construction, industrial projects of scale, led by energy, onshore manufacturing and datacenters, continue to lead the segment, accounting for the majority of total nonresidential product shipments. Over the medium term, we expect that enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act will further support and accelerate post-pandemic secular growth trends. This includes restructured manufacturing and energy supply chains, the electric vehicle transition and continued adoption of digital and cloud-based technologies resulting in robust demand within the heavy nonresidential sector. In our supplemental materials, we outlined examples of both in-process and recently announced large industrial projects in our key markets, reflective of these trends. The aggregates intensive nature and multiyear duration of these projects are expected to extend the nonresidential construction cycle. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted light commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect these gains will moderate as these categories generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Shifting to residential. We expect this segment shipments to follow the trend in housing starts, which remain weak. However, we anticipate medium-term improvement as interest and mortgage rates stabilize. Moreover, we expect comparatively positive trends in our Sunbelt markets where there is a significant structural housing deficit due to a decade of underbuilding. As a result, we continue to expect the current housing slowdown will be moderate in our key metropolitan areas as affordability headwinds recede. In summary, we expect 2023 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We anticipate flat aggregates shipments at the midpoint of guidance, as we continue to expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale, we'll largely insulate product shipments from a residential slowdown and a related moderation in light commercial construction. We now expect aggregates pricing growth of 13% to 15%, underscored by attractive 2022 exit rates, early 2023 pricing momentum and a steadfast commitment to our value over volume commercial strategy, which should more than offset continued inflationary pressure and result in expanded gross margins and accelerated unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from cement, downstream operations and Magnesia Specialties, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion or a 15.6% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held for sale. To conclude, we are proud of our 2022 record-setting performance in a dynamic and challenging environment. Equally, we're confident about our 2023 guidance and our ability to navigate the current macroeconomic headwinds, while further demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates-led business model. As such, we expect the fourth quarter commercial and margin expansion momentum to accelerate in 2023, resulting in attractive earnings growth and superior value creation for our stakeholders. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. Volume seems to be a pretty clear, you gave a lot of details. I wanted to focus my question today on pricing. You had very strong double-digit year-over-year pricing and the aggregates in cement and very strong sequential pricing on top of that. Could you clarify your views just in light of price increases for cement early in the year and for aggregates also earlier in the year, the thoughts of resiliency, acceptance and how timing differences this year may impact the cadence versus prior years? Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please standby. Please standby, your conference call will resume momentarily. Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on line. Your conference call will resume momentarily. Once again, please remain on your line, your conference call will resume momentarily. Speakers, you may resume your conference.\nWard Nye: Kathryn, can you hear me?\nKathryn Thompson: All right. I can repeat the question again.\nWard Nye: Because technology is great when it works and it's terrible when it doesn't. So let's talk about things that work. What's your question, Kathryn?\nKathryn Thompson: Okay, yes, today's has been the day technology for no time. What I said is the volume for the quarter and really kind of as a look toward, makes a lot of sense in terms of what we've seen based on our primary research. I wanted to focus the question on pricing. You had strong double-digit pricing in cement and aggregates, and very strong sequential pricing aggregates building on momentum. You have price increases in January for both cement and aggregates. What is your commentary on resiliency, differences in timing and then also acceptance, given the landscape that we have right now, which is a little bit different? All of it gets into helping us better understand the cadence as we go through '23. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Kathryn, thanks. Thank you for the question, Kathryn. So several things. So let's talk about aggregates first, then we'll talk about cement. So, to your point, 16.5% up in the quarter for aggregates is impressive by any standard. Keep in mind too, that was up 5.6% sequentially. And again, it brought us very much within the range that we had started saying we thought we were going to hit during the year. Obviously, when we look at cement, that was up 20.7% for the quarter, up almost 17% for the full year. So a couple of thoughts on that. One, upstream materials pricing tends to be very resilient. So if we go back over time and look at what has happened in particular with aggregates, aggregates is not a space that gives back pricing. Number two, and I think this is important. Keep in mind, we were moving the pricing as the year went on. As I've said in the prepared remarks, an inflationary environment is hugely helpful for upstream materials. What's the challenge is when it moves so rapidly and moves in big chunks. And that's what happened in 2022. So what I thought was particularly powerful in the quarter is to see margin expansion in Q4 despite the fact volumes were down 12%. So do I think that shows good cost control? Yes. Do I think it shows the power of pricing? Yes. Do I think pricing sticks going into the new year? It's not just that it sticks, I think it continues to expand. Because keep in mind, we're going to continue to see degrees of inflation in our business from our suppliers as well. The difference is now we've caught up with it. So, I think those are important takeaways. Here's another important takeaway, Kathryn, there are two others. Number one, we have moved the vast majority of our customers to January 1 from a price increase. As you may recall from years past, it was somewhat bifurcated, somewhere in January, somewhere in April, the vast majority now are in January. Number two, we indicated to our customers with our price increase letters coming into the new year that we were reserving our rights to come back and have a conversation relative to mid-year price increases as well. We will obviously talk more about that as we get closer to midyear, but here's some important takeaway. The pricing guidance that we have from 13% to 15%, obviously with the midpoint 14%, it does not have in it right now any midyear price increases. So to the extent that we see those during the course of the year, that would obviously trend to the upside on pricing. So, Kathryn, thank you for the question. I hope that's broadly responsive.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTrey Grooms: Good morning, Ward and Jim. So thanks for the color in the deck. That was very helpful. But, Ward, I was hoping you could dive in a little deeper on your end market expectations, maybe a little more granularity around what is baked into your flat aggregates volume guide for aggregates shipments this year going through each of your end markets and kind of how you get there?\nWard Nye: Happy to, Trey. Thank you for that. So several things. One, if we look at what we believe will be our largest end use in the year, that's going to be infrastructure. We think that's up mid-single digits to high single digits for a number of reasons. One, we outlined at the prepared comments, we have very healthy state DOTs, number one. Number two, if we're looking at highway contract awards, they're up 24% to $80 billion, that's a record number. I mentioned that the Cornyn-Padilla Act that went in really not that long ago is going to add $40 billion just to Martin Marietta top 10 states. That's a big number. We think states will put that money to use. The other thing that I thought was notable as we look at the ballot initiatives from late last year passed at a rate of almost 90%, but importantly, that adds another $23 billion. So when we're looking at already healthy state DOTs, we're looking at Cornyn-Padilla, we're looking at the new long-term highway bill, state initiatives. That's a pretty powerful mix for us, and again, much of what's driving our resilience in that is where. So again, if you go back and look at the states that are so key to us, the Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, California Republic. These states are all in a very good position relative to public infrastructure going forward. As we look at non-res, we see two somewhat different stories in non-res. We think non-res is broadly going to be flat. And here's how we get there. We think large projects of scale, whether it's manufacturing, energy or others and again I think you go back to those states that I was referring you to a minute ago. We think those projects are going to stay very attractive and they tend to be very aggregates intensive work. So do we think having non-res is going to be better? Yes, we do. Do we think like non-res may see some headwinds? Yes, we do. But our view is the heavy piece of it overcomes the light piece of it, leading us to something that we feel like is broadly flat. Look, as we looked at residential, our view is probably not that different than what you seen nationally. The differences are footprint. So do we think single-family res is going to be down? The answer is yes. We think it's going to be down in our footprint, probably 10% to 15%. Again, this is the smallest of our three large end uses. Again, as we're looking in a number of our markets, the biggest issue that we're faced with is not so much affordability, but rather availability, which tells us that housing is going to come under some pressure, probably not as great in our markets as many. The other thing that we think helps mitigate that is we think multifamily is likely to be quite good, and we're seeing good multifamily activity. And then lastly, in our ChemRock and Rail segment. And again, that's going to be railroad balanced, it's going to be, agricultural, lime and others, and we have a bigger end use there than most of our competitors. We feel like that's probably going to be up mid-single digits. So again, as we take infrastructure up, non-res sideways, single family down, ChemRock and Rail up. That leads us broadly to something that we feel like it's going to be flat. But importantly, Trey, part of what we've done is we've gone on a state-by-state basis and we've looked at infrastructure, non-res, res and ChemRock and Rail. And we've tried to look at the jobs that are either in our customers' backlog, we believe that they are well-positioned to get and as we go through that bottoms-up analysis, it brings us from an end-use perspective that we feel like this guide that we put out there is actually a very responsible guide as we look into 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nStanley Elliott: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you all for taking the question. Ward, in the press release, you guys talked about some the visibility that you're seeing in the customer backlog. Let's get a lot more context like [technical difficulty] what you're seeing and then by the same token, you mentioned a number of large-scale projects, a number of large scale kind of government funding initiatives. I'd have to think the visibility is extending out pretty far right now, but love to hear kind of how you're thinking about all that?\nWard Nye: Stanley. Thank you so much for the question. As we look at customer backlogs and we do try to get a good sense of where that sits year-over-year. This is pretty heartening to see, aggregates backlogs is up about 7% over where it was last year and perhaps even more importantly, even as we look at it sequentially from Q3, it continues to move in an attractive way. And as we look at the geography in this. The geography is not surprising to me, but I will tell you too, it's actually comforting to me because the East, which is such an important market to us, Stanley, as you know. The East division backlogs are up around 3%. As we look in the Southwest, again, where we have a very significant position, they're up around 7% versus the prior year quarter. The only places that we're seeing some modest movement, not a big surprise is in really parts of the Central United States. At the same time, it's very early there in the season, but even if we look in cement. It's interesting. When I look at our strategic cement business, again, very focused on Dallas-Fort Worth, very focused on Austin and San Antonio. Backlogs are really quite healthy. And importantly, as we look at our downstream businesses, primarily in Texas, we're seeing ready mixed backlogs, very much in line with prior year and keep in mind, to your point, a lot of what we think is going to happen relative to nonresidential is actually ahead of us on these large energy and related projects. So we think those numbers are likely to build during the course of the year. I think it's always important to remember that as we look at these customer backlogs, particularly this time of year, it only represents I want to say 25% to 35% of annual aggregates in cement shipments. So it's not something that's, no pun intended, chiseled in stone, but nonetheless, it's actually a very good indicator of where we think the year is going, And I think your question really ties back into a degree to what Trey asked, when we're looking at our key states, we're looking at a summary. We're looking at all the end uses. As we're looking at that and then going, is the green, is the yellow, is the red? The vast majority of our key states, you're going to see green indicators on those. So, Stanley. I hope that's helpful.\nStanley Elliott: It sure is. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. Hi Ward or Jim, understanding you don't give quarterly guidance, is there a way to think about how the cadence of earnings or volumes might flow over the four quarters of the year? I'm just thinking the catch-up on price cost and IIJA maybe taking some time to get those dollars spent. Is it accurate to think earnings could be more second-half weighted relative to previous years or is there any anyway we can think about that?\nWard Nye: Yes, I'm going to ask Jim to go through in just a second, and give you a little bit more granularity on it. I mean, several things that you know foundationally. Number one, the two slowest quarters end up being Q1 and Q4. As we think about Q4 and the year that we just lapped, obviously, volumes were down in Q4 at 12% and margin expanded. So, oddly enough, as you think about next year, one of the easier comps we're going to have will likely be later in the year. At the same time, if you think about the way some of this may flow through having accelerated pricing towards the beginning of the year, it might make Q1 look a little bit different, but I will turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the rhythm and cadence that we typically see on volumes. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So thinking about a three-year average, if you look-back three years and then comparing that to 2023, what we're expecting, Q1 will be better in 2023 versus the three-year average and then I'd say it's more leveling out at that point. So Q2 maybe a little bit worse than prior Q2s, but still better than prior year in terms of absolute performance. And then, back half should be equal to what we've seen in prior three years or so on average. So Q1 disproportionately better than historical experience and then Q2 a little worse and in the back half pretty similar.\nWard Nye: And again, these are just percentage basis that we're talking about.\nJim Nickolas: Right, Every quarter to be clear will be better than the prior year quarter on an absolute basis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJerry Revich: I wonder if we could just continue that conversation around the volume comps in the first half of the year, you had an outstanding first quarter of '22, seasonally adjusted run rate was closer to 218 million tons versus the 208 million tons run rate that we're looking for in the guide for '23. So, correct me if I'm wrong, Jim, it sounds like we should be expecting volumes to be down year-over-year just based on the comps through at least the first quarter if not the second quarter. I just want to make sure we're calibrated on the volume cadence over the course of '23.\nJim Nickolas: Yes, that's right, that's right. But the bigger difference is for Q1 outperformance relative to history for '23 is in the price cost spread again versus last quarter. So, that's right. Q1 slightly down, but then growing and exceeding prior year for the remaining three quarters of the year.\nWard Nye: And Jerry, if you reflect on the way these public dollars are going to come through. I think that's actually pretty consistent with what we said last year on how we thought the year would likely build throughout the year. So to Jim's point, we're talking two different things, one, volume, the other is financially, and I think to Jim's point, we're going to see a much better year financially each quarter. I think we're going to see a very attractive sequential build each quarter relative to volumes, and again, I think that's pretty consistent with where we've been and I'd be surprised if you're surprised by that.\nJerry Revich: Super. Appreciate the discussion and outstanding performance, gross profit per ton by the team. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nWard Nye: Phil, are you on-mute?\nOperator: Phil Ng, your line is open, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nTyler Brown: I was just hoping to unpack the non-aggregates gross profit guidance. I think it implies maybe $50 million in growth at the midpoint, if my math is right, but conceptually, got a lot of pricing momentum in cement, natural gas has really rolled over from when we talked back in October. So if you add that backdrop, shouldn't we see really strong gross profit growth in cement midyear in a hedge position that I'm missing. But does that imply that the downstream business maybe you're expecting gross profit dollars to maybe be flat or down or is that not the case?\nWard Nye: All right. I think in large measure what you're saying is right. You're going to see very attractive growth in cement. Number two, remember, we divested about 3 million cubic yards of ready mixed last year and the other thing that has weighed on the downstream businesses have been the input costs, among them aggregates and cement. So in many respects, we have by design pushed a lot of that to our upstream business. So again, you're seeing a business overall that's much more narrow and downstream, much more focused, as we've long been on upstream. I do believe your points around cement are really well taken. I think we anticipate a very impressive cement business this year in Dallas and in San Antonio and in Austin. So, I hope that answers your question specifically. Did I hit what you needed?\nTyler Brown: Yes. That is exactly what I needed. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is now open.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. In the previous question, you highlighted your expectations but infrastructure and nonresidential. I was curious on your comments on light nonresidential being negative. First off, what specifically do you mean by light nonresidential and what kind of indicators you're looking at showing that that you headlined.\nWard Nye: I think we're talking more to, Keith, about office retail, the types of things that would typically follow single-family housing, and again, we're not seeing and taking a deep negative dive, let me be really clear on that. We think it's just going to follow housing for a bit of time. In fact, we think housing, particularly by the time we get to '24 is probably in a pretty reasonable recovery mode. So we feel like the particularly light has never gotten particularly robust to tell you the truth. So we feel like it probably sees a bit of a dip, but if you're looking specifically, it's hospitality, it's retail, it's degrees of office. So as we're looking at manufacturing, as we're looking at energy, as we're looking at warehousing or data or others, we see that actually is quite strong, but I just want to make sure I'm tying it for you back fairly specifically to those types of light things that would typically follow residential with depending on the market, a nine to an 18-month lag.\nKeith Hughes: Okay, one other question too on cement. You have cost headwinds in the quarter. Do you think those headwinds remain at the same level in the first half? I know you said, energy, you expect to be kind of flattish. Is there anything else that's potentially coming that would be an offset by this pricing you're getting?\nWard Nye: I don't think there's going to be anything like energy was last year. I mean, to Jim's points, when he was going through his commentary. I mean overall energy was such a massive headwind to the enterprise. And obviously, cement is a big consumer of energy. I mean, keep in mind $178 million headwind for the year in energy. Now, in fairness, diesel was about half of that, but again, if you're looking at our business in cement or if you're looking at our business even in Mag Specialties, what you'll know is portions of that energy was just up a lot more. I mean, natural gas, depending on the market last year was up around 30%. Coke in some markets was up as much as 116% and coal was up nearly 20%. So to your point, do we think we'll see that degree of lapping again, increases in energy? No, I doubt. But I think Jim has a little bit more. If you'd like to offer you two.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. Two points, Keith. One, maintenance repairs will be higher in '23 for the full year than in '22 for cement. Despite that, however, gross margin percentage, I expect will be higher in '23 than '22.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nPhil Ng: Hi, guys, can you hear me now?\nWard Nye: Welcome back. We missed you, Phil.\nPhil Ng: Thank you. I mean a day of technology fun for both us. So I apologize for that.\nWard Nye: You're telling you know about the fly, Phil.\nPhil Ng: So, Ward. I mean, you sound pretty excited about the opportunity on the public infrastructure side and I just want to make sure we don't get carried away just because there's always labor issues, supply chain and how this stuff could ramp up. Just the level of confidence you're seeing from your customers whether they're making investments on the labor side, just the visibility on how that kind of ramps up and you kind of highlighted some other longer-term acts like the IRA, CHIPS Act and then something new today, Cornyn-Padilla. Those three things, how does that kind of ramp, we generally have a better feel for IIJA.\nWard Nye: Yes. I think the others ramp very naturally throughout the year and that's why I think going back to Jim's point, the cadence is going to be attractive financially all the way through. The cadence from a volume perspective will likely be second-half weighted. And I think our confidence around a lot of that is driven by some of the things that we've seen even recently. I'm sure you saw, Phil, that Governor DeSantis has recently announced, for example, a new legislative proposal in Florida to allocate $7 billion to accelerate timing of critical road projects in that state. I was actually in Florida last week and one of the big issues that they were indicating is we're concerned about an aggregates shortage and of course, we're going to do all we can to make sure that they don't have an aggregates shortage in Florida. And as you may recall, Phil, it's so interesting to me to see that we did 208 million tons last year. And remember, this organization did 205 million tons back in 2005, 2006, and we've added 15 million tons of capacity on a per annum basis to what we've done since then. So to your point, if there is a need, can we put it on a spec product on the ground to meet it? Absolutely we can, number one. Number two, do I think contractors over the last year have done what they needed to in varying degrees to have a labor force that's ready for what's coming? I think they have. Number three. I think the labor pool is moving around a bit, and what I mean by that is, even if they need to now go to the well and hire more, I think the opportunities are going to be there. So to your point. I think the states have pretty heady expectations on what they're going to do. Importantly, they have pretty heady budgets that can help further that. Number three, we have the capacity to feed it. And number four, contractors have seen this picture coming and I think they've put themselves in a position to perform, Phil. So again, I hope that's helpful and responsive.\nPhil Ng: Yes, that's great color. And sorry to sneak one in, you've given some color on how to think about demand for aggregates. Texas cement. I mean, Texas is a different animal altogether, just giving the funding. How should we think about the demand backdrop for Texas cement this year?\nWard Nye: Yes. I think the demand backdrop will continue to be attractive in Texas and I think the thing that you need to remember. I think about Texas through several different lenses. Ours is primarily on cement, focused on the Metroplex, Dallas-Fort Worth, which is where the biggest single piece of our cement business is going. Secondarily, it's going to be on Central Texas, which is let's call it mid-30% of our cement is going. So by the time we get to South Texas or West Texas, we're talking about markets that from a percentage perspective on the zip code of 10%. If we look overall at the way cadence has typically gone in cement. I mean, if we look at last year, for example, we sold a little bit over 1 million tons in Q1, 1.1 million tons in Q2, 1 million tons in Q3, and then in a very weather impacted Q4, 950 million tons. So much of cement is going to ready mixed that's not as sensitive to weather for example as asphalt and paving is and you should see a pretty steady cadence to the cement shipments. Obviously, you're going to see s different pricing construct early in the year in that business, so. I hope that gives you a sense of the rhythm on how we think that's going to work, Phil?\nPhil Ng: Should we expect it to be up or kind of flattish to like aggregates, on the shipment side.\nWard Nye: Obviously, we're not giving shipment guidance, but we talked about the fact that it's a sold-out market and we sold 4.2 million tons last year, so. I'll put it this way, Phil. We're selling everything we make in that marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, Ward, Jim and Jennifer. Ward, maybe for Jim, if you could discuss. So you talk about.\nWard Nye: Mike, I'm sorry to interrupt you. You need to you need to lean in to hear you better. It's hard to hear you.\nMichael Dudas: Can you hear me now?\nWard Nye: Yes, sir, much better.\nMichael Dudas: Can you talk about capital allocation for 2023. Any shift given that you've assimilated the acquisition from 2021 and maybe how cash flows trending, working capital use because of revenues improving and the capital expenditures you're thinking for 2023, any shift amongst the three buckets that we should be thinking about?\nWard Nye: Yes, let me take the front end of that and talk about priorities. Jim will come back and give you some specifics on what different elements of that are looking like. What I would say is this. If you go back in time, you recall, 2021 was the year of large transactions for us, the largest transactions from a cash perspective the company has ever done. 2022 was largely a year in that dimension of integrating businesses, making sure they were looking, feeling and acting like Martin Marietta businesses, making sure we had the price increases then and putting ourselves in a position that we could de-lever our balance sheet. So if you recall, we like to be in a two to two and a half times position net debt-to-EBITDA through a cycle. We're at the top end of that right now. Obviously, if we look at where we think we would be at year end, absent M&A, we will be considerably lower in that we think from a cash-flow perspective and otherwise this can be very attractive. So to answer your question directly. Have our priorities changed? No. We want to continue growing this business. We want to continue to invest in the upstream business. Part of what I believe we've done too, now with the coast-to-coast business, is we have even served to de-risk M&A going forward more. And what I mean by that is most of the places in which we want to grow in large measure, we have a footprint today, which means the integration that we're going to have going forward gets to be integration done with people who work for our business, who understand our culture, who understand our operating philosophy and who understand our commercial philosophy as well. Now, Jim will take you through some of the other questions you had relative to capex and otherwise in cash flow, and I think what you'll find is we have a series of very high class problems that we need to worry about. So, Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Yes, so our EBITDA obviously is expected to grow meaningfully. Some of that extra cash flow from the earnings will be deployed in capex. So capex is growing, we raised that from $480 million this year, it's closer to $600 million next year. So that'll be a part of it that's of course helping with future growth. Beyond that, by and large, the rest of the capital should be, the cash should flow through and we will have available for deployment pursuing our priority list of acquisitions, upstream acquisitions first and then returning capital to shareholders.\nWard Nye: Mike, did we get you what you need?\nMichael Dudas: Yes, thanks, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks for taking my question. Clearly a nice pricing year in 2023, building up 2022. Just curious, Ward. If you think that volumes stay in this plus two, minus two range, can that still support high single-digit, double-digit pricing in 2024. I know it's early to think about 2024 already. Just curious what headwinds could lead to that price growth in 2023, rolling over in 2024 or conversely, what would still support that level of pricing as we go into exit this year into next year? Thank you.\nWard Nye: Michael, thank you for the question. And you're right, it's probably too early to lean too far in 2024. What I'll remind everyone is this pricing in these upstream materials has always been very resilient, number one. Number two, we do not sell a discretionary product. These are products that people need. Number three, we're a very small portion of overall construction. Next, much of the inflation contractors and others have seen on a percentage basis, particularly during '22, we're actually ahead of where we were because we protect contractors on bids. Obviously, we were going to be chasing that for a good part of the year, then we caught up with it towards the end of the year. Obviously, we would like not to be behind that again. Part of what I've spoken to our team about is this notion of being in a position that we can look realistically and responsibly and at least two price increases a year. I indicated before that 13% to 15 %that we have for this year does not have in it mid-year price increases despite the fact that we've told our customers in letters that we will be looking at that at midyear. So I haven't answered your question definitively relative to '24, because at this point I simply can't. But if I look at the building blocks that I believe you can look at and investors can look at and have a good way to think about it. I think the color that I put around that gives you a pretty good runway toward how you can put a notion towards it.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you.\nWard Nye: Operator? Yes, go ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thielman: Thank you. Lot covered here. I guess just one, Ward. As If you look beyond the impact of sort of inclement weather this quarter, more from the view of what you've seen in the business during months where you're able to get product out, how would you characterize the headwinds you've really seen from residential end markets so far. Is it already in the zip code of that 10% to 15% decline you're talking about for '23 or have you been surprised at the resiliency?\nWard Nye: It's been interesting. I'll go to your point. I think you raised a good question on what the underlying marketplace looks like and here's the way that I've thought about it. If we look at the fourth quarter that was heavily weather impacted. Infrastructure was down 11%, non-res was down 12%, res was down in that zip code that we think that they were saying it's going to be doing, mid-teens, right. And we still saw expanded margin. But here's what I know. There's gobs of infrastructure work to be done out there, which tells me when I'm looking at these numbers down those percentage, it was more a weather event in our markets as opposed to a market-driven event in our markets. So to your point, what we're kind of seeing as we go through. It means we're looking at things right now, I will tell you, business relative to plan on where we thought we would be. And frankly, business looks a little better than plan right now. So again, as we're looking at a very soft Q4 for all the reasons we discussed, as we've looked at what we are guiding toward flat and as we look at least as much as you can tell in January and February with a big caveat that it's January and February, it looks pretty good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up real quick just on that last point you made, Ward, about the first quarter looking a little bit better than your plan. I'd imagine that's more than just pent-up demand from weather delays in the fourth quarter. So just want to confirm that and then maybe just on the cost side for aggregates. Wondering if you could maybe provide some more color on what you're assuming outside of the diesel observation?\nWard Nye: Sure, I'll do them in two ways. Then, I'm going to ask Jim to come back and talk to you a little bit about cost per ton and the cost buckets. To your point, if we think about what we've seen so far this year, Garik, California's had pretty epic rains. If you think about the cold weather that settled in on Texas here a couple of weeks ago. I mean, that was basically a week lost in Texas, and of course, Texas is our largest state by revenue. And but you're in the Midwest, you're in Cleveland, you've seen a very cold winter so far this year. So as we're seeing activity in what has not been in many respects the kindest month and a half so far, it's that degree of resilience that we're seeing that gives us the confidence that we have the guide right now and obviously that's just looking in large measure at the level of activity. We're not even speaking about the level of pricing in that context, Garik. So does that help you?\nGarik Shmois: Yes, it does and the comment around the Midwest being cold has certainly resonated.\nWard Nye: I would imagine. Let Jim come back and talk a little bit about the different cost buckets.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So if you're holding energy aside, which I think you did in your question, it's high single digits is the cost inflation we're expecting for 2023. It's pretty broad based across personnel, supplies, repairs, contract services, et-cetera. So obviously that's all contemplated in our guide. We just are happy to see our ASP outstripping that growth and leading to the margin expansion. Does that answer your question, Garik?\nGarik Shmois: Yes, it does. Thanks for that and others.\nJim Nickolas: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\nJoe Nolan: Hi, good morning this is Joe Nolan on for David. So. I guess first, just wondering transportation seemed to be pretty problematic throughout 2022. Just wondering how you're thinking about transportation heading into 2023 and how that might have factored into your guidance?\nWard Nye: That's a great question and what I would tell you is we were waiting all year for it to get better and it did get better. As we were seeing the year ramp up, we were certainly seeing rail activities going better than they had for a while. So we're heartened by that. But I think the other thing that I was really comforted by was really after what was a pretty challenging half one for trucking, trucking got better in the second half of the year. So as trucking clearly got better in half two, we just in wetter and obviously the railroads had a difficult time for much of 2022. Service picked up pretty notably as we got towards the end of the year and that's both in the East and the West. And your question, such a good one. Joe, because you'll recall, we shipped more stone by rail than any other aggregates producer in the United States, probably two x our closest competitor. So there's a sense in which rails performance in 2022 combined with what was a pretty tough half one on trucking, was going to serve to be a more meaningful impediment to us than it wants to others. So as rail continues to get better and as trucking gets better, I think we will certainly feel the benefit of that perhaps in ways that others won't, Joe.\nJoe Nolan: That's great, thank you. And if I could one quick a follow-up. You mentioned earlier on a question that you do not have any midyear pricing actions factored into the guidance. Was that strictly for aggregates or was that for other segments as well.\nWard Nye: That was for everything.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rohit Seth with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nRohit Seth: Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on aggregate prices, you mentioned the 13% to 15% increase does not include a second half increase and there has been broad acceptance of an increase. Being early in the year, I'm just curious, is the confidence on realizing the increase is a reflection of your internal downstream operations stepping in increase or is this the market competition is going along with it. And then the second part of that is, is there any mix in your footprint that might be helping Martin versus say the broader market, I'm thinking about North Carolina here?\nWard Nye: Yes, no, that's a great question. Thank you, Rohit. So, I would say could say several things. One, the customer acceptance of the price increases has been good. So let's start with that. So we've seen widespread. They understand it, they've seen their own input pressures. They know that we're feeling it. So number one, it's been well received. Number two, you're right. But keep in mind, we treat our business the same way that we treat outside businesses to the extent that we're downstream. So we know what that's obviously going to look like. Number three, to your point on whether there's any mix issues. I would say that I mentioned during the course of the dialog I was having earlier with respect to backlogs. These backlog is nicely up year-over-year. Southwest backlog is equally nicely up year-over-year. East from at least a mix perspective are some of our highest margins markets, so to the extent that that business continues to go an attractive way. That could certainly be a help relative to mix. Obviously, more to come. It's early. I indicated, that's typically 25% to 30% of a full year's volume. So more to come, but I hope that answers your question, Rohit?\nRohit Seth: It does. Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to hand the call back over to Ward Nye for closing remarks.\nWard Nye: Well, again. Thank you all so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's track record of success through various business cycles proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model. We continue to strive for the safest operations and remain focused on executing our strategic plan, while continuing to drive attractive and sustainable growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2023 results in the spring. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that in 2022, Martin Marietta delivered our most profitable year and our 11th consecutive year of growth for consolidated products and services revenues, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA. Martin Marietta also achieved a world class total injury incident rate for the second year in a row and a world class lost time incident rate for the sixth consecutive year. We delivered these record results along with platform M&A integration and multiple portfolio optimization actions amid a challenging macroeconomic setting that included a housing slowdown, monetary tightening and 40-year high inflation. Martin Marietta's accomplishments are a testament to our team's steadfast commitments to the disciplined execution of our strategic plan. Most importantly, the company is well-positioned to deliver another record year in 2023. Before discussing our full year results, I'll briefly highlight a few takeaways from the fourth quarter. While pricing growth significantly accelerated, product shipments were adversely affected by inclement weather and a number of key Martin Marietta geographies. As a reminder, we're comparing 2022 results against the fourth quarter of 2021 when we benefited from unseasonably warm and dry weather that extended the construction season late into the year. With this context, aggregates shipments decreased 12% against the prior year quarter. Yet, as we began 2023, aggregates customers' backlogs remained healthy and shipment trends thus far are ahead of planned levels. Aggregates pricing in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased a robust 16.5%, a quarterly record or 5.6% sequentially, providing attractive tailwinds into 2023. Further, despite the weather impacts on operating leverage and acceleration of certain operating expenses, pricing growth drove aggregates gross margin expansion and improved gross profit per ton shipped by 25% over the prior year quarter. In summary, for the final quarter of 2022, poor weather was a literal headwind. The 2023 stage has been set, both operationally and commercially. Now, let's turn to our full year 2022 results and the new financial records we set for an 11th consecutive year in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated products and services revenues of $5.7 billion, a 13% increase, consolidated gross profit of $1.4 billion, a 6% increase, and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a 5% increase. These results underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which we successfully implemented multiple pricing actions in 2022. As a result, we achieved double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines. However, we were not immune to the rapid and significant inflationary pressures that impacted our operating costs and affected our product gross margin, which declined 160 basis points to 24.9% for the year. As an example, 2022s results included $178 million of energy cost headwinds, an over 55% increase compared with 2021. It bears repeating that inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for our upstream materials, the benefits of which long endure after inflationary pressures abate. We believe our multiple commercial actions enacted in 2022, coupled with broad customer support of our January 1st, 2023 price increases will drive meaningful pricing acceleration and margin expansion in 2023. Let's now turn to our full year operating performance, beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments increasing 3.3% to 208 million tons. Aggregate pricing fundamentals remain very attractive as pricing increased 10.6% or 10% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record yearly shipments of 4.2 million tons and pricing growth of 16.9%. We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future based on market trends and the success of our January 1st price increases. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, prior year shipment comparability for ready mixed concrete is notably impacted by last April's divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and only partially offset by our Arizona acquisition. Cumulatively, concrete shipments decreased 25.4% and pricing increased 11.3%, reflecting multiple pricing actions in the year, including fuel surcharges in order to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost increases. Asphalt shipments increased 28.4% driven by contributions from our acquired California and Arizona operations, which also impacts the prior year comparability. Pricing improved 23.6%, following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our 2023 outlook, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our 2022 discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim? Thanks Jim. We're finally enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we build upon the foundation established in 2022. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to support multiyear demand for our products across infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors, thereby improving the durability of our business through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Starting first with infrastructure. The value of state and local governments highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator of future demand, grew 24% to a record $102 billion in 2022. By comparison, the compounded annual growth rate for combined highway and bridge awards from 2018 through 2021, was 1.7%. State Departments of Transportation or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states remain robustly funded with budgets all above or in line with prior year levels and are well-positioned from a resource aspect and desire perspective to deploy the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. In addition to the multiyear funding from the IIJA in December 2022, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package. Included in the package is the Cornyn-Padilla amendment allowing states and local municipalities to use unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. It's estimated this alone will provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding for Martin Marietta's top 10 states. Importantly, investments in our nation's infrastructure maintains broad public support. During the November 2022 election, voters nationwide approved 87% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $23 billion of additional infrastructure funding. A few notable funding initiatives include $15 billion in Texas, $3 billion in San Francisco, $1.3 billion in South Carolina, through a sales tax addition and $1 billion in Colorado, through the renewal of a sales tax addition. We expect this significantly enhanced level of federal, state and local infrastructure investment to yield multiyear demand for our products in this important counter-cyclical end market and drive aggregates shipments to infrastructure closer to our 10-year historical average of 39% of total shipments, as compared to 35% in 2022. Moving now to nonresidential construction, industrial projects of scale, led by energy, onshore manufacturing and datacenters, continue to lead the segment, accounting for the majority of total nonresidential product shipments. Over the medium term, we expect that enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act will further support and accelerate post-pandemic secular growth trends. This includes restructured manufacturing and energy supply chains, the electric vehicle transition and continued adoption of digital and cloud-based technologies resulting in robust demand within the heavy nonresidential sector. In our supplemental materials, we outlined examples of both in-process and recently announced large industrial projects in our key markets, reflective of these trends. The aggregates intensive nature and multiyear duration of these projects are expected to extend the nonresidential construction cycle. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted light commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect these gains will moderate as these categories generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Shifting to residential. We expect this segment shipments to follow the trend in housing starts, which remain weak. However, we anticipate medium-term improvement as interest and mortgage rates stabilize. Moreover, we expect comparatively positive trends in our Sunbelt markets where there is a significant structural housing deficit due to a decade of underbuilding. As a result, we continue to expect the current housing slowdown will be moderate in our key metropolitan areas as affordability headwinds recede. In summary, we expect 2023 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We anticipate flat aggregates shipments at the midpoint of guidance, as we continue to expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale, we'll largely insulate product shipments from a residential slowdown and a related moderation in light commercial construction. We now expect aggregates pricing growth of 13% to 15%, underscored by attractive 2022 exit rates, early 2023 pricing momentum and a steadfast commitment to our value over volume commercial strategy, which should more than offset continued inflationary pressure and result in expanded gross margins and accelerated unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from cement, downstream operations and Magnesia Specialties, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion or a 15.6% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. As a reminder, this guidance excludes the businesses classified as assets held for sale. To conclude, we are proud of our 2022 record-setting performance in a dynamic and challenging environment. Equally, we're confident about our 2023 guidance and our ability to navigate the current macroeconomic headwinds, while further demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates-led business model. As such, we expect the fourth quarter commercial and margin expansion momentum to accelerate in 2023, resulting in attractive earnings growth and superior value creation for our stakeholders. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you. Kathryn, can you hear me? Because technology is great when it works and it's terrible when it doesn't. So let's talk about things that work. What's your question, Kathryn? Kathryn, thanks. Thank you for the question, Kathryn. So several things. So let's talk about aggregates first, then we'll talk about cement. So, to your point, 16.5% up in the quarter for aggregates is impressive by any standard. Keep in mind too, that was up 5.6% sequentially. And again, it brought us very much within the range that we had started saying we thought we were going to hit during the year. Obviously, when we look at cement, that was up 20.7% for the quarter, up almost 17% for the full year. So a couple of thoughts on that. One, upstream materials pricing tends to be very resilient. So if we go back over time and look at what has happened in particular with aggregates, aggregates is not a space that gives back pricing. Number two, and I think this is important. Keep in mind, we were moving the pricing as the year went on. As I've said in the prepared remarks, an inflationary environment is hugely helpful for upstream materials. What's the challenge is when it moves so rapidly and moves in big chunks. And that's what happened in 2022. So what I thought was particularly powerful in the quarter is to see margin expansion in Q4 despite the fact volumes were down 12%. So do I think that shows good cost control? Yes. Do I think it shows the power of pricing? Yes. Do I think pricing sticks going into the new year? It's not just that it sticks, I think it continues to expand. Because keep in mind, we're going to continue to see degrees of inflation in our business from our suppliers as well. The difference is now we've caught up with it. So, I think those are important takeaways. Here's another important takeaway, Kathryn, there are two others. Number one, we have moved the vast majority of our customers to January 1 from a price increase. As you may recall from years past, it was somewhat bifurcated, somewhere in January, somewhere in April, the vast majority now are in January. Number two, we indicated to our customers with our price increase letters coming into the new year that we were reserving our rights to come back and have a conversation relative to mid-year price increases as well. We will obviously talk more about that as we get closer to midyear, but here's some important takeaway. The pricing guidance that we have from 13% to 15%, obviously with the midpoint 14%, it does not have in it right now any midyear price increases. So to the extent that we see those during the course of the year, that would obviously trend to the upside on pricing. So, Kathryn, thank you for the question. I hope that's broadly responsive. Happy to, Trey. Thank you for that. So several things. One, if we look at what we believe will be our largest end use in the year, that's going to be infrastructure. We think that's up mid-single digits to high single digits for a number of reasons. One, we outlined at the prepared comments, we have very healthy state DOTs, number one. Number two, if we're looking at highway contract awards, they're up 24% to $80 billion, that's a record number. I mentioned that the Cornyn-Padilla Act that went in really not that long ago is going to add $40 billion just to Martin Marietta top 10 states. That's a big number. We think states will put that money to use. The other thing that I thought was notable as we look at the ballot initiatives from late last year passed at a rate of almost 90%, but importantly, that adds another $23 billion. So when we're looking at already healthy state DOTs, we're looking at Cornyn-Padilla, we're looking at the new long-term highway bill, state initiatives. That's a pretty powerful mix for us, and again, much of what's driving our resilience in that is where. So again, if you go back and look at the states that are so key to us, the Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, California Republic. These states are all in a very good position relative to public infrastructure going forward. As we look at non-res, we see two somewhat different stories in non-res. We think non-res is broadly going to be flat. And here's how we get there. We think large projects of scale, whether it's manufacturing, energy or others and again I think you go back to those states that I was referring you to a minute ago. We think those projects are going to stay very attractive and they tend to be very aggregates intensive work. So do we think having non-res is going to be better? Yes, we do. Do we think like non-res may see some headwinds? Yes, we do. But our view is the heavy piece of it overcomes the light piece of it, leading us to something that we feel like is broadly flat. Look, as we looked at residential, our view is probably not that different than what you seen nationally. The differences are footprint. So do we think single-family res is going to be down? The answer is yes. We think it's going to be down in our footprint, probably 10% to 15%. Again, this is the smallest of our three large end uses. Again, as we're looking in a number of our markets, the biggest issue that we're faced with is not so much affordability, but rather availability, which tells us that housing is going to come under some pressure, probably not as great in our markets as many. The other thing that we think helps mitigate that is we think multifamily is likely to be quite good, and we're seeing good multifamily activity. And then lastly, in our ChemRock and Rail segment. And again, that's going to be railroad balanced, it's going to be, agricultural, lime and others, and we have a bigger end use there than most of our competitors. We feel like that's probably going to be up mid-single digits. So again, as we take infrastructure up, non-res sideways, single family down, ChemRock and Rail up. That leads us broadly to something that we feel like it's going to be flat. But importantly, Trey, part of what we've done is we've gone on a state-by-state basis and we've looked at infrastructure, non-res, res and ChemRock and Rail. And we've tried to look at the jobs that are either in our customers' backlog, we believe that they are well-positioned to get and as we go through that bottoms-up analysis, it brings us from an end-use perspective that we feel like this guide that we put out there is actually a very responsible guide as we look into 2023. Stanley. Thank you so much for the question. As we look at customer backlogs and we do try to get a good sense of where that sits year-over-year. This is pretty heartening to see, aggregates backlogs is up about 7% over where it was last year and perhaps even more importantly, even as we look at it sequentially from Q3, it continues to move in an attractive way. And as we look at the geography in this. The geography is not surprising to me, but I will tell you too, it's actually comforting to me because the East, which is such an important market to us, Stanley, as you know. The East division backlogs are up around 3%. As we look in the Southwest, again, where we have a very significant position, they're up around 7% versus the prior year quarter. The only places that we're seeing some modest movement, not a big surprise is in really parts of the Central United States. At the same time, it's very early there in the season, but even if we look in cement. It's interesting. When I look at our strategic cement business, again, very focused on Dallas-Fort Worth, very focused on Austin and San Antonio. Backlogs are really quite healthy. And importantly, as we look at our downstream businesses, primarily in Texas, we're seeing ready mixed backlogs, very much in line with prior year and keep in mind, to your point, a lot of what we think is going to happen relative to nonresidential is actually ahead of us on these large energy and related projects. So we think those numbers are likely to build during the course of the year. I think it's always important to remember that as we look at these customer backlogs, particularly this time of year, it only represents I want to say 25% to 35% of annual aggregates in cement shipments. So it's not something that's, no pun intended, chiseled in stone, but nonetheless, it's actually a very good indicator of where we think the year is going, And I think your question really ties back into a degree to what Trey asked, when we're looking at our key states, we're looking at a summary. We're looking at all the end uses. As we're looking at that and then going, is the green, is the yellow, is the red? The vast majority of our key states, you're going to see green indicators on those. So, Stanley. I hope that's helpful. Yes, I'm going to ask Jim to go through in just a second, and give you a little bit more granularity on it. I mean, several things that you know foundationally. Number one, the two slowest quarters end up being Q1 and Q4. As we think about Q4 and the year that we just lapped, obviously, volumes were down in Q4 at 12% and margin expanded. So, oddly enough, as you think about next year, one of the easier comps we're going to have will likely be later in the year. At the same time, if you think about the way some of this may flow through having accelerated pricing towards the beginning of the year, it might make Q1 look a little bit different, but I will turn it over to Jim to talk a little bit about the rhythm and cadence that we typically see on volumes. Jim? And again, these are just percentage basis that we're talking about. And Jerry, if you reflect on the way these public dollars are going to come through. I think that's actually pretty consistent with what we said last year on how we thought the year would likely build throughout the year. So to Jim's point, we're talking two different things, one, volume, the other is financially, and I think to Jim's point, we're going to see a much better year financially each quarter. I think we're going to see a very attractive sequential build each quarter relative to volumes, and again, I think that's pretty consistent with where we've been and I'd be surprised if you're surprised by that. Phil, are you on-mute? All right. I think in large measure what you're saying is right. You're going to see very attractive growth in cement. Number two, remember, we divested about 3 million cubic yards of ready mixed last year and the other thing that has weighed on the downstream businesses have been the input costs, among them aggregates and cement. So in many respects, we have by design pushed a lot of that to our upstream business. So again, you're seeing a business overall that's much more narrow and downstream, much more focused, as we've long been on upstream. I do believe your points around cement are really well taken. I think we anticipate a very impressive cement business this year in Dallas and in San Antonio and in Austin. So, I hope that answers your question specifically. Did I hit what you needed? I think we're talking more to, Keith, about office retail, the types of things that would typically follow single-family housing, and again, we're not seeing and taking a deep negative dive, let me be really clear on that. We think it's just going to follow housing for a bit of time. In fact, we think housing, particularly by the time we get to '24 is probably in a pretty reasonable recovery mode. So we feel like the particularly light has never gotten particularly robust to tell you the truth. So we feel like it probably sees a bit of a dip, but if you're looking specifically, it's hospitality, it's retail, it's degrees of office. So as we're looking at manufacturing, as we're looking at energy, as we're looking at warehousing or data or others, we see that actually is quite strong, but I just want to make sure I'm tying it for you back fairly specifically to those types of light things that would typically follow residential with depending on the market, a nine to an 18-month lag. I don't think there's going to be anything like energy was last year. I mean, to Jim's points, when he was going through his commentary. I mean overall energy was such a massive headwind to the enterprise. And obviously, cement is a big consumer of energy. I mean, keep in mind $178 million headwind for the year in energy. Now, in fairness, diesel was about half of that, but again, if you're looking at our business in cement or if you're looking at our business even in Mag Specialties, what you'll know is portions of that energy was just up a lot more. I mean, natural gas, depending on the market last year was up around 30%. Coke in some markets was up as much as 116% and coal was up nearly 20%. So to your point, do we think we'll see that degree of lapping again, increases in energy? No, I doubt. But I think Jim has a little bit more. If you'd like to offer you two. Welcome back. We missed you, Phil. You're telling you know about the fly, Phil. Yes. I think the others ramp very naturally throughout the year and that's why I think going back to Jim's point, the cadence is going to be attractive financially all the way through. The cadence from a volume perspective will likely be second-half weighted. And I think our confidence around a lot of that is driven by some of the things that we've seen even recently. I'm sure you saw, Phil, that Governor DeSantis has recently announced, for example, a new legislative proposal in Florida to allocate $7 billion to accelerate timing of critical road projects in that state. I was actually in Florida last week and one of the big issues that they were indicating is we're concerned about an aggregates shortage and of course, we're going to do all we can to make sure that they don't have an aggregates shortage in Florida. And as you may recall, Phil, it's so interesting to me to see that we did 208 million tons last year. And remember, this organization did 205 million tons back in 2005, 2006, and we've added 15 million tons of capacity on a per annum basis to what we've done since then. So to your point, if there is a need, can we put it on a spec product on the ground to meet it? Absolutely we can, number one. Number two, do I think contractors over the last year have done what they needed to in varying degrees to have a labor force that's ready for what's coming? I think they have. Number three. I think the labor pool is moving around a bit, and what I mean by that is, even if they need to now go to the well and hire more, I think the opportunities are going to be there. So to your point. I think the states have pretty heady expectations on what they're going to do. Importantly, they have pretty heady budgets that can help further that. Number three, we have the capacity to feed it. And number four, contractors have seen this picture coming and I think they've put themselves in a position to perform, Phil. So again, I hope that's helpful and responsive. Yes. I think the demand backdrop will continue to be attractive in Texas and I think the thing that you need to remember. I think about Texas through several different lenses. Ours is primarily on cement, focused on the Metroplex, Dallas-Fort Worth, which is where the biggest single piece of our cement business is going. Secondarily, it's going to be on Central Texas, which is let's call it mid-30% of our cement is going. So by the time we get to South Texas or West Texas, we're talking about markets that from a percentage perspective on the zip code of 10%. If we look overall at the way cadence has typically gone in cement. I mean, if we look at last year, for example, we sold a little bit over 1 million tons in Q1, 1.1 million tons in Q2, 1 million tons in Q3, and then in a very weather impacted Q4, 950 million tons. So much of cement is going to ready mixed that's not as sensitive to weather for example as asphalt and paving is and you should see a pretty steady cadence to the cement shipments. Obviously, you're going to see s different pricing construct early in the year in that business, so. I hope that gives you a sense of the rhythm on how we think that's going to work, Phil? Obviously, we're not giving shipment guidance, but we talked about the fact that it's a sold-out market and we sold 4.2 million tons last year, so. I'll put it this way, Phil. We're selling everything we make in that marketplace. Mike, I'm sorry to interrupt you. You need to you need to lean in to hear you better. It's hard to hear you. Yes, sir, much better. Yes, let me take the front end of that and talk about priorities. Jim will come back and give you some specifics on what different elements of that are looking like. What I would say is this. If you go back in time, you recall, 2021 was the year of large transactions for us, the largest transactions from a cash perspective the company has ever done. 2022 was largely a year in that dimension of integrating businesses, making sure they were looking, feeling and acting like Martin Marietta businesses, making sure we had the price increases then and putting ourselves in a position that we could de-lever our balance sheet. So if you recall, we like to be in a two to two and a half times position net debt-to-EBITDA through a cycle. We're at the top end of that right now. Obviously, if we look at where we think we would be at year end, absent M&A, we will be considerably lower in that we think from a cash-flow perspective and otherwise this can be very attractive. So to answer your question directly. Have our priorities changed? No. We want to continue growing this business. We want to continue to invest in the upstream business. Part of what I believe we've done too, now with the coast-to-coast business, is we have even served to de-risk M&A going forward more. And what I mean by that is most of the places in which we want to grow in large measure, we have a footprint today, which means the integration that we're going to have going forward gets to be integration done with people who work for our business, who understand our culture, who understand our operating philosophy and who understand our commercial philosophy as well. Now, Jim will take you through some of the other questions you had relative to capex and otherwise in cash flow, and I think what you'll find is we have a series of very high class problems that we need to worry about. So, Jim? Mike, did we get you what you need? Michael, thank you for the question. And you're right, it's probably too early to lean too far in 2024. What I'll remind everyone is this pricing in these upstream materials has always been very resilient, number one. Number two, we do not sell a discretionary product. These are products that people need. Number three, we're a very small portion of overall construction. Next, much of the inflation contractors and others have seen on a percentage basis, particularly during '22, we're actually ahead of where we were because we protect contractors on bids. Obviously, we were going to be chasing that for a good part of the year, then we caught up with it towards the end of the year. Obviously, we would like not to be behind that again. Part of what I've spoken to our team about is this notion of being in a position that we can look realistically and responsibly and at least two price increases a year. I indicated before that 13% to 15 %that we have for this year does not have in it mid-year price increases despite the fact that we've told our customers in letters that we will be looking at that at midyear. So I haven't answered your question definitively relative to '24, because at this point I simply can't. But if I look at the building blocks that I believe you can look at and investors can look at and have a good way to think about it. I think the color that I put around that gives you a pretty good runway toward how you can put a notion towards it. Operator? Yes, go ahead. It's been interesting. I'll go to your point. I think you raised a good question on what the underlying marketplace looks like and here's the way that I've thought about it. If we look at the fourth quarter that was heavily weather impacted. Infrastructure was down 11%, non-res was down 12%, res was down in that zip code that we think that they were saying it's going to be doing, mid-teens, right. And we still saw expanded margin. But here's what I know. There's gobs of infrastructure work to be done out there, which tells me when I'm looking at these numbers down those percentage, it was more a weather event in our markets as opposed to a market-driven event in our markets. So to your point, what we're kind of seeing as we go through. It means we're looking at things right now, I will tell you, business relative to plan on where we thought we would be. And frankly, business looks a little better than plan right now. So again, as we're looking at a very soft Q4 for all the reasons we discussed, as we've looked at what we are guiding toward flat and as we look at least as much as you can tell in January and February with a big caveat that it's January and February, it looks pretty good. Sure, I'll do them in two ways. Then, I'm going to ask Jim to come back and talk to you a little bit about cost per ton and the cost buckets. To your point, if we think about what we've seen so far this year, Garik, California's had pretty epic rains. If you think about the cold weather that settled in on Texas here a couple of weeks ago. I mean, that was basically a week lost in Texas, and of course, Texas is our largest state by revenue. And but you're in the Midwest, you're in Cleveland, you've seen a very cold winter so far this year. So as we're seeing activity in what has not been in many respects the kindest month and a half so far, it's that degree of resilience that we're seeing that gives us the confidence that we have the guide right now and obviously that's just looking in large measure at the level of activity. We're not even speaking about the level of pricing in that context, Garik. So does that help you? I would imagine. Let Jim come back and talk a little bit about the different cost buckets. That's a great question and what I would tell you is we were waiting all year for it to get better and it did get better. As we were seeing the year ramp up, we were certainly seeing rail activities going better than they had for a while. So we're heartened by that. But I think the other thing that I was really comforted by was really after what was a pretty challenging half one for trucking, trucking got better in the second half of the year. So as trucking clearly got better in half two, we just in wetter and obviously the railroads had a difficult time for much of 2022. Service picked up pretty notably as we got towards the end of the year and that's both in the East and the West. And your question, such a good one. Joe, because you'll recall, we shipped more stone by rail than any other aggregates producer in the United States, probably two x our closest competitor. So there's a sense in which rails performance in 2022 combined with what was a pretty tough half one on trucking, was going to serve to be a more meaningful impediment to us than it wants to others. So as rail continues to get better and as trucking gets better, I think we will certainly feel the benefit of that perhaps in ways that others won't, Joe. That was for everything. Yes, no, that's a great question. Thank you, Rohit. So, I would say could say several things. One, the customer acceptance of the price increases has been good. So let's start with that. So we've seen widespread. They understand it, they've seen their own input pressures. They know that we're feeling it. So number one, it's been well received. Number two, you're right. But keep in mind, we treat our business the same way that we treat outside businesses to the extent that we're downstream. So we know what that's obviously going to look like. Number three, to your point on whether there's any mix issues. I would say that I mentioned during the course of the dialog I was having earlier with respect to backlogs. These backlog is nicely up year-over-year. Southwest backlog is equally nicely up year-over-year. East from at least a mix perspective are some of our highest margins markets, so to the extent that that business continues to go an attractive way. That could certainly be a help relative to mix. Obviously, more to come. It's early. I indicated, that's typically 25% to 30% of a full year's volume. So more to come, but I hope that answers your question, Rohit? Well, again. Thank you all so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's track record of success through various business cycles proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model. We continue to strive for the safest operations and remain focused on executing our strategic plan, while continuing to drive attractive and sustainable growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2023 results in the spring. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions that you may have. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted record products and services revenues of $5.45 billion, a 13.4% increase over last year and a product gross profit record of $1.34 billion, an 8.1% increase. Aggregates product gross profit improved 8.3% relative to the prior year, achieving a record $980 million. Aggregates product gross margin declined 160 basis points to 28%, as robust pricing growth throughout the year did not serve to offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs until the fourth quarter of 2022. Our Texas cement business delivered an all-time record top and bottom line results. Product revenues increased 21.8% to $602 million, while product gross profit increased 30.1% to $204 million. Importantly, execution of our disciplined commercial approach drove product gross margin expansion of 210 basis points to 33.9% despite significant energy cost headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. 2022 was a great year for our strategic cement business. It's worth highlighting this business growth and performance over the last three years. Since 2019, shipments are up 8%, while product revenues are up 37%. Revenue has grown over 4.5 times faster than shipments, demonstrating the team's commitment to commercial excellence. Over that same timeframe, gross profit is up 42% despite energy costs doubling. And consistent operational improvements focused on reliability and efficiency have brought increased production and higher margins. This journey of growth is far from complete. As previously disclosed, our Midlothian plant has several initiatives underway to improve production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024. The other initiatives remain on-track and have already provided additional capacity. At both the Midlothian and Hunter plants, we have largely completed converting our construction cement customers from Type 1 and Type 2 cement to the less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. The cumulative efforts of our capital expenditures at Midlothian and the conversion to Type 1L resulted in growing production volumes by 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 levels. We expect those efforts to provide an additional capacity expansion of 5% in 2023. Our ready mixed concrete product revenues declined 17% to $931 million, and product gross profit declined 27.2% to $70 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations and partially offset by contributions from our acquired Arizona operations impacting prior year comparability. Increased aggregates and cement costs further weighed on gross margin, which declined 100 basis points to 7.3%. Our 2022 asphalt and paving results include the acquired California and Arizona operations impacting comparability with the prior year. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $775 million, a 50.8% increase over the prior year. Product gross profit increased $3 million to $82 million, while continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to product gross margin decline of 480 basis points to 10.6%. Magnesia Specialties generated product revenues of $278 million, a 1.2% increase over the prior year. However, higher energy, supplies and contract services expenses resulted in a product gross profit decline of 13.5% of $96 million, and product gross margin compression of 580 basis points to 34.4%. Our full year energy expense was $178 million or 55% higher than the prior year and diesel fuel accounted for approximately half of that cost increase. While diesel cost increases moderated in the fourth quarter, they remained a headwind. Our 2023 guidance assumes that the cost per gallon of diesel falls only modestly from current elevated levels. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business while also returning capital to shareholders. In 2022, we returned $309 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. As a reminder, in August 2022, we executed a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi, California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. In October, the Federal Trade Commission issued a second request for information related to this pending transaction and we continue to work towards closing this matter in a timely manner. At December 31st, 2021, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times after a year of robust M&A activity. In 2022, our stated focus was on integrating these new operations into our business, executing portfolio enhancing divestitures and deleveraging to within the Company's targeted range. As a result, we achieved a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by year's end. Exiting the year with a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investments in attractive upstream acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward. Yes. So thinking about a three-year average, if you look-back three years and then comparing that to 2023, what we're expecting, Q1 will be better in 2023 versus the three-year average and then I'd say it's more leveling out at that point. So Q2 maybe a little bit worse than prior Q2s, but still better than prior year in terms of absolute performance. And then, back half should be equal to what we've seen in prior three years or so on average. So Q1 disproportionately better than historical experience and then Q2 a little worse and in the back half pretty similar. Right, Every quarter to be clear will be better than the prior year quarter on an absolute basis. Yes, that's right, that's right. But the bigger difference is for Q1 outperformance relative to history for '23 is in the price cost spread again versus last quarter. So, that's right. Q1 slightly down, but then growing and exceeding prior year for the remaining three quarters of the year. Yes. Two points, Keith. One, maintenance repairs will be higher in '23 for the full year than in '22 for cement. Despite that, however, gross margin percentage, I expect will be higher in '23 than '22. Yes, so our EBITDA obviously is expected to grow meaningfully. Some of that extra cash flow from the earnings will be deployed in capex. So capex is growing, we raised that from $480 million this year, it's closer to $600 million next year. So that'll be a part of it that's of course helping with future growth. Beyond that, by and large, the rest of the capital should be, the cash should flow through and we will have available for deployment pursuing our priority list of acquisitions, upstream acquisitions first and then returning capital to shareholders. Yes. So if you're holding energy aside, which I think you did in your question, it's high single digits is the cost inflation we're expecting for 2023. It's pretty broad based across personnel, supplies, repairs, contract services, et-cetera. So obviously that's all contemplated in our guide. We just are happy to see our ASP outstripping that growth and leading to the margin expansion. Does that answer your question, Garik? Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I would now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.\nJennifer Park: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, Q3 2022 supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward Nye will begin today\u2019s earnings call with a discussion of our third quarter operating performance and portfolio optimization effort. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation after which Ward will conclude with end market trends and our preliminary outlook for 2022. The question-and-answer session will follow please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that Martin Marietta delivered record results in the third quarter. This is despite current macroeconomic challenges that include persistent inflationary pressure across multiple cost categories, tighter monetary policies and heightened geopolitical tensions. Our quarterly performance is a testament to our team's commitment to commercial excellence, and execution of our strategic business plan. The results also reflect our successful implementation of double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines, that combined with acquisition contributions, drove record quarterly consolidated total revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per diluted share. Importantly too, our year-to-date safety and health performance, inclusive of acquired operations remains at world class levels as measured by both total injury and lost time incident rates. While we acknowledge and celebrate our continuous safety and health improvement, our work in this vital dimension is never done. In addition, on August 9, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. This transaction aligns with our commitment to an aggregates-led business, complemented by strategic cement assets in certain markets, improves the durability of our business through cycles and provides balance sheet flexibility to continue driving shareholder value. Our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investment and attractive acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders for reducing net leverage to within the company's targeted range. As highlighted in today's release, we achieved a number of significant financial and operating records in the third quarter, including consolidated total revenues increased 16% to $1.81 billion. Consolidated adjusted gross profit increased 8% to $488 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $533 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 10% to $4.69. These results on flat organic aggregate shipments underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which multiple pricing actions were successfully implemented this year. However, inflationary trends also impacted our operating costs and affected our adjusted consolidated gross margin, which declined 200 basis points to 26.9% for the quarter. Notably, this is both a moderated pace and sequentially higher as compared with the second quarter of 2022. As a result of the current demand environment and persistently high inflation, we've advised customers of fourth quarter price increase in a number of our markets as well as broad based January 1, 2023 increases. We believe these commercial initiatives together with other inflation containment actions, position Martin Marietta well to expand margins in the fourth quarter, and deliver another year of strong profitability in 2023. For our company, if past is prologue, and we believe that it is as inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials the benefits of which endure long after inflationary pressures abate. Let's now turn to our third quarter operating performance starting with aggregates. We continue to experience healthy aggregate demand across the company with total aggregate shipments inclusive of acquisitions, increasing 5.6% to a quarterly record of 60.2 million tons. Organic aggregate shipments were largely flat, as otherwise strong demand was offset by supply chain disruptions, inclement weather in certain key markets, and most notably, logistics constraints and cement shortages, the latter curbing the immediate need for aggregates in the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete. Aggregates pricing fundamentals from a very attractive and organic aggregates pricing increased 11.9% or 11.3% on a mixed adjusted basis. The cumulative effect of multiple pricing actions continued to build in third quarter. These disciplined actions combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility bode well for meaningful price acceleration in the fourth quarter, and in 2023. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply resulting in effectively sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop, and combined with our cement team\u2019s focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record third quarter shipments of 1.1 million tons and pricing growth of 21.4% as our second $12 per ton increase this year, went into effect on July 1. We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future supportive of our recently announced $20 per ton price increase effective January 1, 2023. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, organic ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 16.8%, largely due to a historically wet August in North Texas, as well as the completion of certain large projects in the quarter. Organic pricing increased to 20.3%, reflecting multiple price actions, including fuel surcharges necessary to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost pressures. Organic asphalt shipments increased 4.3%, driven primarily by strong demand in Colorado, while organic pricing improved 22% to help offset the increase in raw materials costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen, notably for comparative purposes prior year, asphalt volumes were constrained by bitumen shortage in Colorado, including contributions from our acquired operations in California and Arizona, asphalt shipments and pricing increased 31.3% and 26.1%, respectively. Before discussing our preliminary 2023 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with review of our financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. And good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted an all-time record this quarter, with products and services revenues of $1.61 billion, a 15.9% increase over last year, and an adjusted product gross profit record of $467 million, an increase of 10.9%. Adjusted aggregates product gross profit improved 10.5% relative to the prior year's quarter to a record $330 million. Adjusted aggregate product gross margin declined 240 basis points to 32.5% as robust pricing growth had not yet offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs. Our Texas cement business delivered all time, quarterly records for top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 23.4% to $163 million, while gross profit increased 35.7% to $68 million. Importantly, execution of a discipline commercial strategy drove a gross margin expansion of 380 basis points to 41.5%. That was despite notable energy costs headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. Domestic production capacity constraints and strong demand contributes to extremely tight supply in the North and Central Texas markets. As a reminder, we are taking two notables, near term steps to increase cement production capacity in Texas. First, we're in the midst of conversions at our Midlothian and Hunter plant to manufacture a less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. This eco-friendly product has been approved by the Texas Department of Transportation, and we believe our customers will view it as providing significant stakeholder benefits. Once we have completed our transition to Type 1L, our cement production capacity will increase by approximately 10%. Second, we are installing a new finish mill at our Midlothian plant, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. This new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of much needed incremental production capacity to the Texas marketplace. Our third quarter ready-mixed concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1, and include the acquired Arizona operations impacting the comparability with the prior year quarter. On an as reported basis, ready-mixed concrete product revenues declined 29.1% to $227 million, and gross profit declined 40.3% to $90 million, driven primarily by the divestiture which was partially offset by contributions from the acquired operations. Increased raw material costs further weighed on the gross margin for the quarter. Our asphalt and paving results include the operations acquired on the West Coast, impacting comparability with the prior year quarter. On an as reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $310 million, a 58.1% increase and record adjusted gross profit of $50 million, a 22.9% increase, however, continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to the adjusted product gross margin decline of 470 basis points to 16.3%. Magnesia specialties generated product revenues of $69 million, a 4% decrease, driven largely by lower demand for domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products. Product gross profit declined 22.9% to $22 million, as higher energy costs resulted in gross margin compression of 770 basis points to 31.3%. On a consolidated basis, other operating income net included $50 million in nonrecurring gains from the sale of surplus land and other assets. We saw sequential moderation in diesel costs in the third quarter. During the month of October, diesel prices have trended back up. While we anticipate additional volatility in diesel prices. We are forecasting that fourth quarter prices approximate current levels. As a result, with diesel costs no longer increasing sequentially, coupled with our discipline pricing initiatives, we expect to return to expanding gross margins in the fourth quarter as compared with the prior year period. We remain focused on a disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business, while also returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $141 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 288,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $347 per share in the third quarter. We also reduced gross leverage this past quarter. On September 29, the company utilized cash on the balance sheet to satisfy and discharge a $700 million tranche of senior notes due July 2023. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued to trend down and ended the quarter at 2.6x. We continue to anticipate a return to the top end of our target net leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x by year end. Additionally, the company's board of directors approved an 8% increase in a quarterly cash dividend paid in September underscoring its confidence in our future performance and free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend is now $2.64 per share. Since our repurchased authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends, as well as share repurchases. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2022 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results as well as the impact of lower expected aggregate volumes and continued inflationary pressure. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1, 610 million to $1,675 million which excludes the nonrecurring gain on the divestiture in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks Jim. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023, demand from expanded federal and state level infrastructure investment coupled with heavy industrial projects of scale, are expected to offset near-term affordability driven headwinds in the historically under build residential sector. Importantly, we have both the ability and capacity to supply these needed products and supported by our locally led pricing strategy will do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. As we enter the fourth quarter, aggregates customer backlogs are ahead of prior year levels, with supply chain challenges continuing to serve as the primary governor, the growth of product shipments. In the third quarter, infrastructure shipments accounted for 36% of total volumes, in the current period of broader economic uncertainty, one constant theme across our footprint is that infrastructure. Our single largest end used market is poised for accelerated growth as already healthy state Department of Transportation, or DOT budgets receive incremental funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA through the allocation for the 2023 fiscal year, most of which began on July 1. Notably, for the first eight months of the year, Federal aid highway construction obligations for the company's top 10 states are up 28% relative to the prior year period. As a result, we expect a step change in the public sector investment in 2023 to provide a stable base level of demand for years to come. Aggregate shipments for nonresidential end market accounted for 35% of total third quarter volumes. Nonresidential construction project backlogs remain strong in our markets led in large measure by heavy side energy, critical product manufacturing and data center projects of scale. The announcements of these projects are accelerating, driven by a post pandemic shift in global energy and manufacturing supply chains as well as data usage from adoption of digital and cloud-based services. Illustrative projects in our markets include Golden Pass LNG, and CPChem\u2019s plastic facility along the Texas Gulf Coast. Samsung's semiconductor operation in Austin, the Taiwan Semiconductor campus near Phoenix, Stellantis, Samsung joint venture lithium-ion battery plant near Indianapolis, both VinFast electric vehicle and Wolfspeed plan chip manufacturing site near Raleigh, Durham, and metadata centers in Kansas City and Des Moines. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted like commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect this recovery will moderate as these categories generally follows single family residential development. Not surprisingly, the residential end market, which accounts for 23% of our total third quarter shipments began to slow down in the third quarter as organic shipments of the sector decreased 3% following the decline in single family housing starts, which was partially offset by continued strength in multifamily construction. That said, housing across our Sunbelt footprint remains under built amid significant population inflows with demand far exceeding supply. As shown in our supplemental slides, single family housing starts per capita in our key metro areas remains significantly and to varying degrees below peak 2005 levels. As such, we continue to expect the current affordability driven single family housing slowdown to be moderate in our key metropolitan areas, as home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium. As we look to 2023, our preliminary view anticipates aggregate shipments to be effectively flat. As we expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale will largely insulate product shipments from a slowdown in the single-family residential sector. We remain confident that favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy will continue to be supported by attractive 2022 exit rates, as well as realization of our announced January 1, 2023 price increases. Together, we expect this will drive low double-digit growth in aggregates pricing in 2023. To conclude, we're proud of our record setting performance against a challenging backdrop. We expect our current momentum to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and in 2023, resulting in a return to margin expansion. We remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices, and the execution of our strategic plan. In doing so, we're confident in our ability to successfully navigate the current macro-economic challenges are demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates led business model. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stan Elliott with Stifel.\nStan Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Ward, you mentioned the infrastructure piece has been critical in the next year. Can you talk a little bit more about the state budgets? Kind of what you're seeing how it looks right now? And their ability to get projects and lettings out the door for you.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Stanley. Thank you for the question. I guess several things, one, not all states are going to be created equal. And part of what we've been focused on is building our business in the right states. So if we look at our top 10 states, overall, we're seeing basically budgets for next year that are up around 10%. And that can move around a lot. So for example, North Carolina, our home state here up 11%, Florida, up 27%, South Carolina important state for us up 28%. Part of what we're seeing too is not just increased funding, but in many respects, Stanley, the way that states are looking at funding. So for example, in North Carolina 2% of sales tax in FY23 will find their way to infrastructure, that's going to work its way up to 4% than 6% over a multi-year period. At the same time, even reflecting on Florida, Florida recently passed in their FY23 budget, basically a historic high. And they're looking at $4.4 billion for highway construction and another $1.2 billion just for resurfacing. And then if we're looking at Texas, which is our largest state by revenue, their 10-year unified transportation program is $85 billion worth of projects, to try to contextualize that that's a 13% increase from the \u201822 plan. So the nice thing is when you sit back and look at what we're going to have, from a baseline from IIJA, which is going to be the single largest pop we've seen since the Interstate Highway Act went into law in 1956. And then you feather on top of that very healthy state budgets. It's a pretty attractive backdrop. It's important to see to Stanley, I think, to your question, if we're looking at those same top 10 states in contract awards here today, they're up around 13%. But importantly, to us, we're looking at federal aid, highway construction obligations, year-to-date. Those are also up 28%. So as we think about what public is going to look like for us next year, on the federal side, plus to your question on the state piece of it. We think that's attractive, and it starts leading us back towards volume on public that looks more like history, in the low 40% of our volume, as opposed to what you heard me speak to just moments ago, which was in the high 30s. So, Stanley, I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thomson Research Group.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. It was great color on the public end market. And you've also given some good color into early pricing actions between 3% return per ton increase for cement and low teens for aggregates. But when we look at the private side, what gives you confidence particularly focusing on customer backlogs about what to expect for 2023 and particular more color on backlogs that you're seeing right now. That gives a view for next year. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Kathryn, thank you for the question. Look, as we look at customer backlogs compared to where we were last year, this time. In aggregates they're actually nicely up about 7%. If we look in ready-mixed, they're also up. If we look in cement it's broadly flat. And we're expecting actually to pick up some nice work in Q4. And keep in mind and cement, we're dealing with the market in Texas that is uniquely largely sold out. So if we're looking at backlogs today for customers versus where we were a year ago, it's actually pretty attractive. I think the other piece of your question that's so important, Kathryn, as we think about \u201823, our view is clearly public is going to be healthier, as we think about \u201823, the heavy side of nonres, and we look at that through projects that are in the process of being led. We also look at projects and square footage that's out there in particular, we're seeing the heavy side of nonres manufacturing, energy, et cetera being very attractive the markets in which we're operating. Do we think we're likely to see some degree of moderation in the light nonres? Probably so. Do I think the US is going to see a degree of cooling in single family housing, we already have, I think that persists. But I think if we look at multi residential housing, that's going to be really resilient, we're probably going to see a nice pop, and that. So as we step back and look at backlogs, and think about end users, public appears to be quite healthy, nonres on the heavy side is quite healthy. Multifamily res is healthy, and we think single family residential, and the light side of non is where we're likely to see varying degrees of weakness. Now one of the things that we've been careful to do, and you see it in our supplemental slides, we've tried to spell out with specificity certain key MSAs, four of them in the West, four of them in the East, that we think are indicative of what's happened to population in our key MSAs. And what's happened to housing. I think an analysis of that will reveal to the extent that the US feels some degree of headwinds on housing, ours will not be as pronounced. So Kathryn, I've tried to deal with both the public and the private side to give you some good data points on why we have the degree of resilience we do around relatively flat volumes going into 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone. Ward, your summit pricing there in the quarter very impressive performance and looking into 2003. How much of today's pricing will be carried over from this year into next year. And then you mentioned having some widespread increases in January. And we've heard of some being announced for the Texas summit market in the in the January timeframe. But if you could comment on that, and maybe around the magnitude you're expecting there.\nWard Nye: Look, it's been, thank you for the Trey, for the question, Trey. It's been a good year for pricing. And for Texas summit this year. We anticipate that's going to recur next year. I mean, if we look at ASP for the quarter, it was up 21.4% on a reported basis, 20.6% on a mix adjusted basis. What that's done to your point in cement is basically led to a new all-time record for gross product. And you can see gross margins that are above 40%. If we think about the Texas cement market, here's some things to remember, I think this gives you a good build on why we have resilience, around a $20 per ton increase effective January 1. That's a market that's going to consume around 20 million ton of cement per annum. But it's a market that has a capacity to produce it in the state of Texas at about 16 million tons. In other words, that goes back to my commentary in the prepared remarks that the markets effectively sold out. So keep in mind we've got two plants, one in Midlothian, one at Hunter, so we're in Central and North Texas, frankly where water imports are not particularly meaningful to what we're doing. So I wouldn't say all of that underscores why we have resilience around the pricing. The other piece of it that I think is important, and I think it likely recurs is I'm not going to lead you to believe that we have enormous amounts of material going to basically oil well cement. But there is some going to West Texas, those are actually a much higher ASPs than you'd see ordinarily. And I think reflecting back on the geopolitical tensions that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. It's hard to imagine that that piece of our business is going to slow. The other things that I think are important to keep in mind, Trey. One, we're also seeing a conversion, as Jim said in his comments to the Type 1L cement. In that process, we'll actually get about 10% more capacity as we go into next year. And then it won't be immediate next year, but you will see more capacity come online as we finish mill that's underway at Midlothian right now. That's going to add another 450,000 tons to that marketplace that actually desperately needs it. So again, $20 a ton is what we're looking for. I think that answers your question specifically. But again, I wanted to give you some other data to give you a sense of why we have a high degree of confidence in that number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. Ward, I'm wondering if you could talk about, Ward, if we were to assume a mild recession next year and volumes are down year-over-year versus the base case of flat, it feels like with the pricing gains over the course of this year, you folks would still be positioned to expand aggregates margins by a couple of hundred basis points, given the puts and takes in that scenario. I'm wondering if you might be willing to comment on that just conceptually, given the timing of permanent price increase over the course of this year versus the quicker diesel and other inflation that we saw in the beginning of the year and as a result, the catch-up we're going to see in '23?\nWard Nye: Sure, Jerry. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. Your question, which I think is a really good one, really focuses on margin and what we think happens with volumes. So several things that I would point out. One, if you look at what we're saying for the balance of the year, we're actually anticipating margin expansion returning in Q4. So what that means is multiple price increases in a big heavy industry are actually finally catching up and passing what have been the cost inputs. We also expect that to recur going into next year. Now to your point, what happens if you see volume more bearish than we anticipate volume being next year. What I would do is I'd take you back, and it's been a while, Jerry, this might have before you were actually following us, but if we go back to 2005, 2006 and '07, what you'll actually see if you look at history, is the industry generally, Martin Marietta specifically, was finding peak volumes back in 2005, but we're actually seeing peak profitability in that last cycle in 2006, which underscores in many respects why we speak to this volume -- this value over volume strategy because we recognize how valuable that is to our business. The other thing that I'll outline, Jerry, because you've seen it, and I think it's probably echoed in some of your writings as well. The pricing in aggregates tends to be a very durable set of pricing. So as we go through cycles inevitably in the fullness of time, and I'm not sure if next year is going to be a down cycle or not, we don't think it will be right now because of the strength in public. We have a lot of confidence around the resiliency of the aggregate pricing. So as we think about what is likely to happen in margins in Q4, we think they expand. If we look at what we think is likely to happen to margins in '23. Again, we think they likely expand. So hopefully, that answers your question and maybe 10% more, Jerry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.\nPhil Ng: Hey, guys. Appreciate the forward color for 2023. So maybe a question for Jim. Your flat volume guidance, appreciating a lot of uncertainty on housing and maybe on the light side for commercial. Can you kind of help us unpack the percentage growth you're assuming for housing, nonres and infrastructure? And on the infrastructure side, we could appreciate the lightings and bidding activity has really dialed up. But more help us understand kind of like the cadence of when that big inflection kind of comes through next year? Thanks a lot.\nWard Nye: Look, I think you're going to start through the inflection as we get closer toward half year next year, in particular. Keep in mind, it's always interesting to me, people want to look at Q1 and try to divine some degree of rhythm or cadence out of Q1. And remember, in our world, Q1 is January, February and March. And what I've long said is oftentimes Q1 is made or broken by the last two weeks in March, which is no way to really judge the rest of the year. I think going back to the percentages that I spoke to a little while ago and infrastructure gives you a good sense of what that rhythm and cadence can look like through the balance of the year, I think part of what we're going to be seeing, and I think this is important, Phil, is in infrastructure, we're going to be seeing more capacity type projects led than we've seen in the more recent past. That's important because you're going to send out a much wider array of volumes and more volumes over a period of years. So I would reflect on that. The other thing that I would say in particular, and a lot of this is driven by energy and manufacturing. If we look on the nonres side, what we're seeing, and I mentioned it before, the square footage on a number of these plants, not just in Texas but beyond that, even on some of the new opportunities that we're seeing in the Carolinas and in the central part of the United States, have considerable square footage. These tend to be almost concrete warehousing. And then the other thing that we are seeing is we are seeing estimated start dates now on all of the large LNG or energy plants that we've been looking at in South Texas, all with 2023 start dates and we think that's important as well because when we look at those projects all by themselves and again, I'm talking about six different projects in South Texas, the cumulative yardage and tons from those are 13.7 million tons and about 1.3 million cubic yards. So again, we feel like on those, it won't just be an aggregate or a concrete play for us and varying degrees, it can be a cement play as well. So I would certainly start looking to begin in Q2 to see those volumes ramp up. I think it will particularly be in public. I think you're going to see the heavy side of nonres on manufacturing and in energy actually do quite well. I do think areas like hospitality and others are likely going to slow. It will be curious to see how single-family housing goes in our markets. As I said, I don't think those are going to go off a cliff. I don't think there's room for them to go off a cliff because we're looking at seasonally adjusted starts right now below $900,000. And using a million is a good, steady start. And keep in mind, many of these markets, we are still -- it's not an affordability issue. It's an availability issue. So I think in many respects, it will be curious to see what homebuilders are willing to do relative to their margins. But from a timing perspective, Phil, that's the way I would think about it, and that's how I would handicap it via end users.\nPhil Ng: And Ward, the heavy side pushing a lot of momentum there. Is that enough to like more than offset the light side, at least when you think about 2023?\nWard Nye: I think the scope of some of those heavy projects are so large. I think the short answer is yes, it really can, particularly some of these large energy projects. So I think that's where you end up potentially with that nonres wash. I think that's probably a good word to use.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: Yes, thanks. I wanted to squeeze in two really, hopefully, quick ones. One is you talk about the constraints from cement availability. And I was just wondering how we should think about that improving given some of the expansions you've talked about from existing capacity, yours and others. And then same idea, a smaller market, but on the Magnesia Specialty side, your guidance assumes a rebound. So is it just a short-term blip you see in the demand side? Or is this something that could perpetuate into next year? Thanks.\nWard Nye: Sure. Timna, thanks for the question. So a couple of things on Mag. I think we anticipate really more of the same from Mag in Q4. I think we actually expect a better year for Mag next year. A couple of things are driving that right now. Steel is run at about 77% of capacity, which is lower than it's been for a while. The chemical side of that business is actually performing quite well. That business has a number of commercial contracts that are rolling off at the end of this year. So as we think about the rhythm and cadence of what that's going to look like from a pricing perspective, next year is actually going to be much more attractive for that business. So that's how I think of that. If I think about the ready-mixed market, in particular, back to your comment relative to cement shortages, part of what that has done is just put ready-mixed players in a position that as they get towards the end of a week, if they don't have significant powder in some markets, they're not buying stone either. Look, I think the fact is cement in some markets could stay tight for a while. And I think that could have from a bit of a logistics perspective, a little bit of a headwind. That's certainly what we've seen this year. it's not a massive headwind to be fair, Timna. I think part of what's happening this year is cement tightness has been an issue. Trucking has been an issue. Rail has been an issue. And I think some of the transportation and logistics issues while still confronting the industry broadly, are getting modestly better. So as we think about those issues going into next year, I would actually anticipate more logistics tailwinds next year than we've seen this year, and then we'll have to see how cement plays out. And keep in mind, Timna, in our world, the only place we have cement, and again, it's very much by design, is the strategic cement position that we have in Texas, where we're the largest producer of aggregates cement and ready-mixed concrete. So I hope that addresses the Mag issue and your thoughts around powder for next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Looking at the fourth quarter in aggregate volumes, the yearly number seems to indicate it's going to be negative. Is that correct? And other than weather is there anything going on within the quarter in aggregates?\nWard Nye: Yes. Keith, thank you for the question. The primary thing that we're looking at as we look at Q4 is severalfold. One, what's the year-to-date look like, two last year, it's worth remembering that we actually had a winner that didn't roll in until very late in the year. So we had a Q4 that was unusually long. So what we're doing in large measure is assuming that a normal winter shows up. And if a normal winter shows up and then we go back and augment it to varying degree some of those items that we were just talking about with Timna, saying what happens with normal winter. What happens if logistics constraints concur or recur and what happens if cement continues to be tight. We're just looking at those things and trying to sort out what we think that could mean for the fourth quarter. And really, your swing factor as much as I hate to say it, is going to end up being winter. There are a number of markets that can be really weather affected that are actually quite good markets today. Among them, for example, Indianapolis is a very attractive market. Minneapolis St. Paul, we're seeing asphalt volumes in that market where we're an FOB provider higher than they were last year. And by the way, we thought last year was a pretty good year. So if we end up with colder weather in some of these markets that are relatively high performing, it does have no pun intended, but chilling effect on what the volumes can look like for the rest of the year, Keith. So that's how we're racking it up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen. Ward, maybe you could remind us sort of what in your guidance for 2022, what was maybe the overall headwind towards the higher energy and materials cost or constraints, labor, however you want to place it? And as you're looking into 2023, certainly, it's certainly it can stay, the inflation stays at a high level, but what kind of moderation may we see and what are the parts that we could look for to help some of the tailwinds if we get this pricing agreement [Inaudible]\nWard Nye: Sure. Let me bifurcate that a little bit. Let me tell you what we saw. Jim will come back and give you a sense of what we're expecting. And so I'll try to break it down just a bit. So again, if we look at diesel cost per gallon and if we're looking at the aggregates business and the single largest energy input, that's what it is. So diesel cost per gallon was up 69%. And what that means is it was up from $2.44 a gallon in Q3 of 2021 to $4.12 a gallon in Q3 of '22. Now in fairness, that did show and Jim commented to this in his prepared remarks, that did show some sequential moderation from what had been $4.60 a gallon in Q2. But so those are pretty big numbers. And there are big numbers in particular when you keep in mind that for a full year, we're anticipating having about 53.5 million gallons of diesel fuel that we will use. Similarly, if we look at electricity and natural gas, and of course, these will be involved in the aggregates business. But in fairness, there are going to be bigger issues in cement and in Mag Specialties. So again, if we're looking at those, the electricity costs were up 46%, Nat gas was up 106% as we look at Q3. So those are pretty significant headwinds that we have during the quarter that I think we actually very successfully navigated. Now speaking a little bit at least on what we look for the rest of the year and into next year. Jim, I'll turn that over to you, if I May?\nJim Nickolas: Sure. So the energy cost for the full year headwind, we're expecting in 2022 is about $190 million or so, give or take, that's a full year view. At this point, we're not assuming those get better or worse next year. They stay elevated, but they don't improve, they don't get worse. So that's a big probably the most volatile of our cost components. Labor stays relatively well behaved. That's our biggest, single biggest cost component at about 20-ish percent. That's going to be maybe a little bit above average, but not too bad. What is growing of late, and I expect to continue into next year, supplies, repairs expense and contract services, those will grow a little bit faster as they have this quarter into next year. But I think all that said, our ASP growth should surpass that cost inflation in 2023.\nMichael Dudas: Those are some stunning numbers, Ward. Well done.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good morning, everyone. Congratulations on all the progress, Ward. I wanted to -- I just want to ask you about Texas cement. And you'd highlighted in response to -- your answer to an earlier question, just everything that's happened this year is kind of out of the ordinary, there's unplanned maintenance outages and we're down to low water on the river, import constraints, solar capacity everywhere. It's been a very, very tight year and an extraordinary pricing environment. But you're kicking off with a 20% increase for 2023 in response to a different question, you indicated you expected the inflection in infrastructure to be midyear, which suggests, I guess, absent something changing on the capacity side that there's another price increase coming mid-year. It just seems like a phenomenal setup in cement. So I'm just wondering, what are the risks, what -- is it resi? And could resi potentially be enough of an issue to be disruptive to all the growth in public and private nonres? Or just interested in how you're thinking about the downside to cement right now.\nWard Nye: No, look, I appreciate the question very much, David. I think cement as a general rule and cement in Texas as a specific rule are probably two different things. And I think part of what gives us such confidence in the Texas market overall is that it\u2019s historically been the market place in which we've seen all the way through cycles, the single highest infrastructure percentage of our business. So when you're in Texas, you're riding on concrete roads and you're going across concrete bridges. And I think that's a really important component to remember when you think about what's happening in that marketplace. The other thing that we've spoken of, David, is really what the requirements are in that state, what the in-state production is in that state and where our plants are located. So if housing slowed to a degree, would that open up some powder, the answer is it probably would. Does that mean that people aren't going to be faced with tightness towards the end of the week and might be able to take more aggregates I think it probably does. So I do think Texas is a very different and it's an overused word, David, but I do think cement in Texas is relatively unique. The other thing that I'll point out that I think has been a big help for us as we've looked at our business over time is the fact is as we look at our reliability and as we look overall at the utilization, of our plants in Texas. They continue on a year-over-year basis to get better. So we're finding ourselves in a position in a market that's very tight that making the shift to Type 1L is going to add capacity, adding the new finish mill at Midlothian is going to add capacity. And the fact is, we're a better cement company now than we were last year, and we're going to be better next year than we are this year. So I think there are a number of components to it. But I do think the commercial aspects of it will continue to be very attractive and right now we've got a lot of resilience around what we're anticipating for 2023 in cement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Hi, great. Thanks. Hey, Ward, if you guys get back within your target leverage range by year-end. Maybe if you could speak to your business development pipeline, overall appetite for M&A next year, a lot of internal focus here on margins in 2022 and obviously going into '23, a lot of the economic certainty out there. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about kind of the business development side.\nWard Nye: Brent, thank you for the question. I think that's such an important one as we go through cycles because our capital priorities are changing. And part of what I find really compelling about Martin Marietta is the ability of this company after having done the most significant cash outlays in its history in M&A last year to be de-levered exactly the way that we anticipated we would be by the end of this year. Now if we think about M&A more broadly, here's what I'll say. A lot of potential deals have come through our funnel in the last 18 months. And what we're trying to be is what you would expect. And that is very disciplined in what we're looking at. We're looking at a number of different potential transactions today. They tend to be almost exclusively. It's not tended to be, they're almost exclusively aggregates-based deals. And those are the types of transactions that we're most interested in. You hear the way that we speak of our business, aggregates-led, strategic cement, targeted downstream. So to the extent that we can continue to grow our aggregates-led business, that's what we're going to want to do. part of what's different now, though, as we think about it, Brent, is our footprint is different. So we have the ability to look in markets that we could not have looked in before to do bolt-on. And the reason that I called that out is bolt-on, if you think about them from a risk allocation perspective are actually very low because you've got operating people in that market, you've got commercial people in that market. Integration can broadly occur over the course of a weekend, and the execution risk is really quite low. So do we continue to look at M&A? The answer is yes. Do I hope that we'll have some things to talk to you about late this year or early next year? I hope so. There are certainly no guarantees on that, but the aim is that we will continue to do that, and you should look for it to continue to be aggregates led. So I hope that's responsive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on the nonresidential side. If you have an estimate of how much of your nonres shipments is going towards that heavy side of nonres, is expected to hold off as opposed to the light nonres? And just to be clear, on the nonres, are you seeing any current delays or cancellations? Or is your outlook there just more indicative of how this end market tends to follow the healthy cycle of the lag?\nWard Nye: Yes. Good to hear your voice, and thanks for the question. I'm going to take part two and ask Jim to come back and deal with part one. So part two, we're not seeing significant cancellations on nonres projects. And frankly, that's not a big surprise to me. The only time in my career that I can remember that we saw that happen in notable ways was coming out of basically that 2005, 2006 where building was so robust and the fall was so precipitous that we saw nonres projects actually stopping or being canceled. As a general rule, they don't they tend to go through. So the short answer is we're not seeing that. The other part of your question is really the breakdown of what's heavy and non et cetera. So I'll turn that over to Jim.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So Garik, the heavy portion of nonres is 55%, the light portion is 45%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. On the public side, you mentioned an inflection in the second half of next year. So is it fair to say that the growth rate in 2024 for public is likely to be higher than the growth rate in 2023? And just a follow-up on that. The industry has observed past cycles where you can get three consecutive years of double-digit pricing. You're doing it in 2022. Next year will be number two. So just -- if public is accelerating in 2024, the heavy side of nonres is okay, do we have underpinnings to get that third year for 2024? Thank you.\nWard Nye: Those are great questions, Michael. So thank you for that. Do I think we're likely to see that type of a build on the public side? The short answer is, yes, I think we probably are. Do I think we're in a position and again, look, this is really ranked speculation so I don't want to get out there too far. I think we've got a good sense of what pricing will be in 2023. And of course, we tried to capture that in what we put out in our preliminary guidance. If we're right, and I believe that we are, that we obviously have a multi-year highway bill. If we're right, that the U.S. is far from overbuilt, if we're right that anything relative to housing will not be deep, it will not be long, and if we're right that the U.S. is going to have to look at higher degrees in particular manufacturing going forward, I think you could take a number of economic indicators in that vein and say that volumes should be relatively attractive on a broader base for an extended period of time. What we've seen relative to pricing, particularly in aggregates is aggregate pricing tends to be attractive even in a challenged volume environment. If we end up finding ourselves in a multiyear circumstance, that you could have flat next year up year after or however you want to fashion it, I do think that you could continue to see a very constructive pricing environment. Now obviously, that's not guidance. That's looking out farther than we would typically look at. Obviously, what we've given you so far is a preliminary view of 2023. But if I'm just taking what has been more years around this industry than on occasion, I'd like to admit, I think what I've just outlined for you would be consistent with broader history.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Just a quick word on the residential side. Are you actually seeing weakness today? And I was just wondering if that has anything to do with the volumes down a little bit in Q4?\nWard Nye: I'm sorry, are we -- what today -- Adam, what is that?\nAdam Thalhimer: Oh, actually seeing weakness in residential today? Or is that still something you just expect to see?\nWard Nye: You know what? In some markets, I wouldn't call it a weakness, I would see the slowdown. And I know that's parsing things a little bit. But overall, the reason that I don't say weakness is they're still in our markets such an acute need. And I think that's the fundamental difference that we're seeing today. So are we seeing a slowdown in large measure because of logistics constraints and otherwise? Yes. Are most of our markets, in my view, more affected today by lack of availability as opposed to affordability? I think that is the bigger issue, Adam. I'm not going to totally dismiss affordability in some circumstances. I mean, let's face it, as a practical matter, we've got a lot more people in the United States and we have interest rates trending up to things that would have looked relatively normal a decade plus ago. So we're going to have to see where that goes. But the short answer is yes, we are seeing some degree of a slowdown. Nothing that we think is dramatic. In fact, we think it's actually quite expected and what we're seeing more broadly. But I do think this is going to be a circumstance where very specific geographies will respond very differently, in particular on single-family housing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning. It looks like CapEx guidance for the year was trimmed a little bit, maybe under $50 million at the midpoint, if I got that right. Can you just talk about what's driving that? And then any kind of implications for CapEx in '23 or maybe early thoughts on '23 CapEx, given you may be kind of flattish on volumes next year?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. It's Jim. Happy to take that question. The reduction in CapEx this year was simply just taking longer to get the money deployed than we had expected earlier in the year. There are no other reasons in the past, frankly. So it's just a reflection of what we think we can get done this year. As for next year, I typically guide focused about 9% of revenues. I think that holds true for next year. So sort of steady as she goes for us, and I would expect the same thing next year at about 9% of sales. Does that answer your question?\nAnthony Pettinari: Yes. No, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley.\nDillon Cumming: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to bring the discussion back to the supply chain logistics for a second. Ward, you were pretty clear that I think elements of like trucking and rail have been kind of constraining aggregates volumes this year. I think you alluded to the fact that those should be kind of improving modestly next year. If we think about the volume assumption that you have for the heavy side of nonres and public and infrastructure. So the '23 outlook of flattish volumes, are you still embedding that those kind of pockets of the end market spectrum are still constrained by those issues? Maybe the trucking and rail or how should we kind of frame up potential upside to that [Inaudible] conservative? And maybe if you start to see more pronounced like relief in those areas as the year progresses?\nWard Nye: Dillon, thank you for the question. The short answer is yes, we are assuming for purposes of next year that they continue to be constrained. We're assuming that degrees of constraints have been relieved but not at all wholly relieved. And keep in mind, we're going to benefit and we're going to have a burden depending on how things work, particularly relative to rail. As rail gets better, we're the largest shipper of stone by rail in the United States. So we will be a disproportionate beneficiary as that circumstance is inevitably righted. At the same time, when it's struggling, we're going to feel it a bit more acutely, and that's where we've been over the last several quarters. So do we think it's going to be completely remedied next year? No. Do we think it's likely to be better? Yes. Do we see it getting better in the second half of this year than it was earlier? Yes. So that gives us a certain degree of resilience around our view on that next year. But that's how we're at least still and we're trying to frame that more broadly.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for any further remarks.\nWard Nye: Again, thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence, and remain focused on executing our strategic plan. Martin Marietta's track record of success throughout various business cycles and our ability to adapt to the various challenges inherent in the current macroeconomic environment proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model. We're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhance shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results with you in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that Martin Marietta delivered record results in the third quarter. This is despite current macroeconomic challenges that include persistent inflationary pressure across multiple cost categories, tighter monetary policies and heightened geopolitical tensions. Our quarterly performance is a testament to our team's commitment to commercial excellence, and execution of our strategic business plan. The results also reflect our successful implementation of double-digit pricing growth across all building materials product lines, that combined with acquisition contributions, drove record quarterly consolidated total revenues, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per diluted share. Importantly too, our year-to-date safety and health performance, inclusive of acquired operations remains at world class levels as measured by both total injury and lost time incident rates. While we acknowledge and celebrate our continuous safety and health improvement, our work in this vital dimension is never done. In addition, on August 9, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Tehachapi California cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland Company for $350 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. This transaction aligns with our commitment to an aggregates-led business, complemented by strategic cement assets in certain markets, improves the durability of our business through cycles and provides balance sheet flexibility to continue driving shareholder value. Our capital allocation priorities remain focused on prudent investment and attractive acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and returning capital to shareholders for reducing net leverage to within the company's targeted range. As highlighted in today's release, we achieved a number of significant financial and operating records in the third quarter, including consolidated total revenues increased 16% to $1.81 billion. Consolidated adjusted gross profit increased 8% to $488 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $533 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 10% to $4.69. These results on flat organic aggregate shipments underscore the success of our value over volume commercial strategy through which multiple pricing actions were successfully implemented this year. However, inflationary trends also impacted our operating costs and affected our adjusted consolidated gross margin, which declined 200 basis points to 26.9% for the quarter. Notably, this is both a moderated pace and sequentially higher as compared with the second quarter of 2022. As a result of the current demand environment and persistently high inflation, we've advised customers of fourth quarter price increase in a number of our markets as well as broad based January 1, 2023 increases. We believe these commercial initiatives together with other inflation containment actions, position Martin Marietta well to expand margins in the fourth quarter, and deliver another year of strong profitability in 2023. For our company, if past is prologue, and we believe that it is as inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials the benefits of which endure long after inflationary pressures abate. Let's now turn to our third quarter operating performance starting with aggregates. We continue to experience healthy aggregate demand across the company with total aggregate shipments inclusive of acquisitions, increasing 5.6% to a quarterly record of 60.2 million tons. Organic aggregate shipments were largely flat, as otherwise strong demand was offset by supply chain disruptions, inclement weather in certain key markets, and most notably, logistics constraints and cement shortages, the latter curbing the immediate need for aggregates in the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete. Aggregates pricing fundamentals from a very attractive and organic aggregates pricing increased 11.9% or 11.3% on a mixed adjusted basis. The cumulative effect of multiple pricing actions continued to build in third quarter. These disciplined actions combined with overall customer confidence and demand visibility bode well for meaningful price acceleration in the fourth quarter, and in 2023. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply resulting in effectively sold-out conditions. Against that backdrop, and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record third quarter shipments of 1.1 million tons and pricing growth of 21.4% as our second $12 per ton increase this year, went into effect on July 1. We expect favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future supportive of our recently announced $20 per ton price increase effective January 1, 2023. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, organic ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 16.8%, largely due to a historically wet August in North Texas, as well as the completion of certain large projects in the quarter. Organic pricing increased to 20.3%, reflecting multiple price actions, including fuel surcharges necessary to pass through raw material and other inflationary cost pressures. Organic asphalt shipments increased 4.3%, driven primarily by strong demand in Colorado, while organic pricing improved 22% to help offset the increase in raw materials costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen, notably for comparative purposes prior year, asphalt volumes were constrained by bitumen shortage in Colorado, including contributions from our acquired operations in California and Arizona, asphalt shipments and pricing increased 31.3% and 26.1%, respectively. Before discussing our preliminary 2023 outlook, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with review of our financial results. Jim? Thanks Jim. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2023, demand from expanded federal and state level infrastructure investment coupled with heavy industrial projects of scale, are expected to offset near-term affordability driven headwinds in the historically under build residential sector. Importantly, we have both the ability and capacity to supply these needed products and supported by our locally led pricing strategy will do so in a manner that emphasizes value over volume. As we enter the fourth quarter, aggregates customer backlogs are ahead of prior year levels, with supply chain challenges continuing to serve as the primary governor, the growth of product shipments. In the third quarter, infrastructure shipments accounted for 36% of total volumes, in the current period of broader economic uncertainty, one constant theme across our footprint is that infrastructure. Our single largest end used market is poised for accelerated growth as already healthy state Department of Transportation, or DOT budgets receive incremental funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA through the allocation for the 2023 fiscal year, most of which began on July 1. Notably, for the first eight months of the year, Federal aid highway construction obligations for the company's top 10 states are up 28% relative to the prior year period. As a result, we expect a step change in the public sector investment in 2023 to provide a stable base level of demand for years to come. Aggregate shipments for nonresidential end market accounted for 35% of total third quarter volumes. Nonresidential construction project backlogs remain strong in our markets led in large measure by heavy side energy, critical product manufacturing and data center projects of scale. The announcements of these projects are accelerating, driven by a post pandemic shift in global energy and manufacturing supply chains as well as data usage from adoption of digital and cloud-based services. Illustrative projects in our markets include Golden Pass LNG, and CPChem's plastic facility along the Texas Gulf Coast. Samsung's semiconductor operation in Austin, the Taiwan Semiconductor campus near Phoenix, Stellantis, Samsung joint venture lithium-ion battery plant near Indianapolis, both VinFast electric vehicle and Wolfspeed plan chip manufacturing site near Raleigh, Durham, and metadata centers in Kansas City and Des Moines. While we continue to see recovery in pandemic impacted like commercial, retail and hospitality sectors, we expect this recovery will moderate as these categories generally follows single family residential development. Not surprisingly, the residential end market, which accounts for 23% of our total third quarter shipments began to slow down in the third quarter as organic shipments of the sector decreased 3% following the decline in single family housing starts, which was partially offset by continued strength in multifamily construction. That said, housing across our Sunbelt footprint remains under built amid significant population inflows with demand far exceeding supply. As shown in our supplemental slides, single family housing starts per capita in our key metro areas remains significantly and to varying degrees below peak 2005 levels. As such, we continue to expect the current affordability driven single family housing slowdown to be moderate in our key metropolitan areas, as home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium. As we look to 2023, our preliminary view anticipates aggregate shipments to be effectively flat. As we expect increased infrastructure investment, coupled with robust activity from heavy nonresidential projects of scale will largely insulate product shipments from a slowdown in the single-family residential sector. We remain confident that favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy will continue to be supported by attractive 2022 exit rates, as well as realization of our announced January 1, 2023 price increases. Together, we expect this will drive low double-digit growth in aggregates pricing in 2023. To conclude, we're proud of our record setting performance against a challenging backdrop. We expect our current momentum to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and in 2023, resulting in a return to margin expansion. We remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices, and the execution of our strategic plan. In doing so, we're confident in our ability to successfully navigate the current macro-economic challenges are demonstrating the resiliency of our proven aggregates led business model. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Good morning, Stanley. Thank you for the question. I guess several things, one, not all states are going to be created equal. And part of what we've been focused on is building our business in the right states. So if we look at our top 10 states, overall, we're seeing basically budgets for next year that are up around 10%. And that can move around a lot. So for example, North Carolina, our home state here up 11%, Florida, up 27%, South Carolina important state for us up 28%. Part of what we're seeing too is not just increased funding, but in many respects, Stanley, the way that states are looking at funding. So for example, in North Carolina 2% of sales tax in FY23 will find their way to infrastructure, that's going to work its way up to 4% than 6% over a multi-year period. At the same time, even reflecting on Florida, Florida recently passed in their FY23 budget, basically a historic high. And they're looking at $4.4 billion for highway construction and another $1.2 billion just for resurfacing. And then if we're looking at Texas, which is our largest state by revenue, their 10-year unified transportation program is $85 billion worth of projects, to try to contextualize that that's a 13% increase from the \u201822 plan. So the nice thing is when you sit back and look at what we're going to have, from a baseline from IIJA, which is going to be the single largest pop we've seen since the Interstate Highway Act went into law in 1956. And then you feather on top of that very healthy state budgets. It's a pretty attractive backdrop. It's important to see to Stanley, I think, to your question, if we're looking at those same top 10 states in contract awards here today, they're up around 13%. But importantly, to us, we're looking at federal aid, highway construction obligations, year-to-date. Those are also up 28%. So as we think about what public is going to look like for us next year, on the federal side, plus to your question on the state piece of it. We think that's attractive, and it starts leading us back towards volume on public that looks more like history, in the low 40% of our volume, as opposed to what you heard me speak to just moments ago, which was in the high 30s. So, Stanley, I hope that helps. Kathryn, thank you for the question. Look, as we look at customer backlogs compared to where we were last year, this time. In aggregates they're actually nicely up about 7%. If we look in ready-mixed, they're also up. If we look in cement it's broadly flat. And we're expecting actually to pick up some nice work in Q4. And keep in mind and cement, we're dealing with the market in Texas that is uniquely largely sold out. So if we're looking at backlogs today for customers versus where we were a year ago, it's actually pretty attractive. I think the other piece of your question that's so important, Kathryn, as we think about \u201823, our view is clearly public is going to be healthier, as we think about \u201823, the heavy side of nonres, and we look at that through projects that are in the process of being led. We also look at projects and square footage that's out there in particular, we're seeing the heavy side of nonres manufacturing, energy, et cetera being very attractive the markets in which we're operating. Do we think we're likely to see some degree of moderation in the light nonres? Probably so. Do I think the US is going to see a degree of cooling in single family housing, we already have, I think that persists. But I think if we look at multi residential housing, that's going to be really resilient, we're probably going to see a nice pop, and that. So as we step back and look at backlogs, and think about end users, public appears to be quite healthy, nonres on the heavy side is quite healthy. Multifamily res is healthy, and we think single family residential, and the light side of non is where we're likely to see varying degrees of weakness. Now one of the things that we've been careful to do, and you see it in our supplemental slides, we've tried to spell out with specificity certain key MSAs, four of them in the West, four of them in the East, that we think are indicative of what's happened to population in our key MSAs. And what's happened to housing. I think an analysis of that will reveal to the extent that the US feels some degree of headwinds on housing, ours will not be as pronounced. So Kathryn, I've tried to deal with both the public and the private side to give you some good data points on why we have the degree of resilience we do around relatively flat volumes going into 2023. Look, it's been, thank you for the Trey, for the question, Trey. It's been a good year for pricing. And for Texas summit this year. We anticipate that's going to recur next year. I mean, if we look at ASP for the quarter, it was up 21.4% on a reported basis, 20.6% on a mix adjusted basis. What that's done to your point in cement is basically led to a new all-time record for gross product. And you can see gross margins that are above 40%. If we think about the Texas cement market, here's some things to remember, I think this gives you a good build on why we have resilience, around a $20 per ton increase effective January 1. That's a market that's going to consume around 20 million ton of cement per annum. But it's a market that has a capacity to produce it in the state of Texas at about 16 million tons. In other words, that goes back to my commentary in the prepared remarks that the markets effectively sold out. So keep in mind we've got two plants, one in Midlothian, one at Hunter, so we're in Central and North Texas, frankly where water imports are not particularly meaningful to what we're doing. So I wouldn't say all of that underscores why we have resilience around the pricing. The other piece of it that I think is important, and I think it likely recurs is I'm not going to lead you to believe that we have enormous amounts of material going to basically oil well cement. But there is some going to West Texas, those are actually a much higher ASPs than you'd see ordinarily. And I think reflecting back on the geopolitical tensions that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. It's hard to imagine that that piece of our business is going to slow. The other things that I think are important to keep in mind, Trey. One, we're also seeing a conversion, as Jim said in his comments to the Type 1L cement. In that process, we'll actually get about 10% more capacity as we go into next year. And then it won't be immediate next year, but you will see more capacity come online as we finish mill that's underway at Midlothian right now. That's going to add another 450,000 tons to that marketplace that actually desperately needs it. So again, $20 a ton is what we're looking for. I think that answers your question specifically. But again, I wanted to give you some other data to give you a sense of why we have a high degree of confidence in that number. Sure, Jerry. Thank you for the question. So a couple of things. Your question, which I think is a really good one, really focuses on margin and what we think happens with volumes. So several things that I would point out. One, if you look at what we're saying for the balance of the year, we're actually anticipating margin expansion returning in Q4. So what that means is multiple price increases in a big heavy industry are actually finally catching up and passing what have been the cost inputs. We also expect that to recur going into next year. Now to your point, what happens if you see volume more bearish than we anticipate volume being next year. What I would do is I'd take you back, and it's been a while, Jerry, this might have before you were actually following us, but if we go back to 2005, 2006 and '07, what you'll actually see if you look at history, is the industry generally, Martin Marietta specifically, was finding peak volumes back in 2005, but we're actually seeing peak profitability in that last cycle in 2006, which underscores in many respects why we speak to this volume -- this value over volume strategy because we recognize how valuable that is to our business. The other thing that I'll outline, Jerry, because you've seen it, and I think it's probably echoed in some of your writings as well. The pricing in aggregates tends to be a very durable set of pricing. So as we go through cycles inevitably in the fullness of time, and I'm not sure if next year is going to be a down cycle or not, we don't think it will be right now because of the strength in public. We have a lot of confidence around the resiliency of the aggregate pricing. So as we think about what is likely to happen in margins in Q4, we think they expand. If we look at what we think is likely to happen to margins in '23. Again, we think they likely expand. So hopefully, that answers your question and maybe 10% more, Jerry. Look, I think you're going to start through the inflection as we get closer toward half year next year, in particular. Keep in mind, it's always interesting to me, people want to look at Q1 and try to divine some degree of rhythm or cadence out of Q1. And remember, in our world, Q1 is January, February and March. And what I've long said is oftentimes Q1 is made or broken by the last two weeks in March, which is no way to really judge the rest of the year. I think going back to the percentages that I spoke to a little while ago and infrastructure gives you a good sense of what that rhythm and cadence can look like through the balance of the year, I think part of what we're going to be seeing, and I think this is important, Phil, is in infrastructure, we're going to be seeing more capacity type projects led than we've seen in the more recent past. That's important because you're going to send out a much wider array of volumes and more volumes over a period of years. So I would reflect on that. The other thing that I would say in particular, and a lot of this is driven by energy and manufacturing. If we look on the nonres side, what we're seeing, and I mentioned it before, the square footage on a number of these plants, not just in Texas but beyond that, even on some of the new opportunities that we're seeing in the Carolinas and in the central part of the United States, have considerable square footage. These tend to be almost concrete warehousing. And then the other thing that we are seeing is we are seeing estimated start dates now on all of the large LNG or energy plants that we've been looking at in South Texas, all with 2023 start dates and we think that's important as well because when we look at those projects all by themselves and again, I'm talking about six different projects in South Texas, the cumulative yardage and tons from those are 13.7 million tons and about 1.3 million cubic yards. So again, we feel like on those, it won't just be an aggregate or a concrete play for us and varying degrees, it can be a cement play as well. So I would certainly start looking to begin in Q2 to see those volumes ramp up. I think it will particularly be in public. I think you're going to see the heavy side of nonres on manufacturing and in energy actually do quite well. I do think areas like hospitality and others are likely going to slow. It will be curious to see how single-family housing goes in our markets. As I said, I don't think those are going to go off a cliff. I don't think there's room for them to go off a cliff because we're looking at seasonally adjusted starts right now below $900,000. And using a million is a good, steady start. And keep in mind, many of these markets, we are still -- it's not an affordability issue. It's an availability issue. So I think in many respects, it will be curious to see what homebuilders are willing to do relative to their margins. But from a timing perspective, Phil, that's the way I would think about it, and that's how I would handicap it via end users. I think the scope of some of those heavy projects are so large. I think the short answer is yes, it really can, particularly some of these large energy projects. So I think that's where you end up potentially with that nonres wash. I think that's probably a good word to use. Sure. Timna, thanks for the question. So a couple of things on Mag. I think we anticipate really more of the same from Mag in Q4. I think we actually expect a better year for Mag next year. A couple of things are driving that right now. Steel is run at about 77% of capacity, which is lower than it's been for a while. The chemical side of that business is actually performing quite well. That business has a number of commercial contracts that are rolling off at the end of this year. So as we think about the rhythm and cadence of what that's going to look like from a pricing perspective, next year is actually going to be much more attractive for that business. So that's how I think of that. If I think about the ready-mixed market, in particular, back to your comment relative to cement shortages, part of what that has done is just put ready-mixed players in a position that as they get towards the end of a week, if they don't have significant powder in some markets, they're not buying stone either. Look, I think the fact is cement in some markets could stay tight for a while. And I think that could have from a bit of a logistics perspective, a little bit of a headwind. That's certainly what we've seen this year. it's not a massive headwind to be fair, Timna. I think part of what's happening this year is cement tightness has been an issue. Trucking has been an issue. Rail has been an issue. And I think some of the transportation and logistics issues while still confronting the industry broadly, are getting modestly better. So as we think about those issues going into next year, I would actually anticipate more logistics tailwinds next year than we've seen this year, and then we'll have to see how cement plays out. And keep in mind, Timna, in our world, the only place we have cement, and again, it's very much by design, is the strategic cement position that we have in Texas, where we're the largest producer of aggregates cement and ready-mixed concrete. So I hope that addresses the Mag issue and your thoughts around powder for next year. Yes. Keith, thank you for the question. The primary thing that we're looking at as we look at Q4 is severalfold. One, what's the year-to-date look like, two last year, it's worth remembering that we actually had a winner that didn't roll in until very late in the year. So we had a Q4 that was unusually long. So what we're doing in large measure is assuming that a normal winter shows up. And if a normal winter shows up and then we go back and augment it to varying degree some of those items that we were just talking about with Timna, saying what happens with normal winter. What happens if logistics constraints concur or recur and what happens if cement continues to be tight. We're just looking at those things and trying to sort out what we think that could mean for the fourth quarter. And really, your swing factor as much as I hate to say it, is going to end up being winter. There are a number of markets that can be really weather affected that are actually quite good markets today. Among them, for example, Indianapolis is a very attractive market. Minneapolis St. Paul, we're seeing asphalt volumes in that market where we're an FOB provider higher than they were last year. And by the way, we thought last year was a pretty good year. So if we end up with colder weather in some of these markets that are relatively high performing, it does have no pun intended, but chilling effect on what the volumes can look like for the rest of the year, Keith. So that's how we're racking it up. Sure. Let me bifurcate that a little bit. Let me tell you what we saw. Jim will come back and give you a sense of what we're expecting. And so I'll try to break it down just a bit. So again, if we look at diesel cost per gallon and if we're looking at the aggregates business and the single largest energy input, that's what it is. So diesel cost per gallon was up 69%. And what that means is it was up from $2.44 a gallon in Q3 of 2021 to $4.12 a gallon in Q3 of '22. Now in fairness, that did show and Jim commented to this in his prepared remarks, that did show some sequential moderation from what had been $4.60 a gallon in Q2. But so those are pretty big numbers. And there are big numbers in particular when you keep in mind that for a full year, we're anticipating having about 53.5 million gallons of diesel fuel that we will use. Similarly, if we look at electricity and natural gas, and of course, these will be involved in the aggregates business. But in fairness, there are going to be bigger issues in cement and in Mag Specialties. So again, if we're looking at those, the electricity costs were up 46%, Nat gas was up 106% as we look at Q3. So those are pretty significant headwinds that we have during the quarter that I think we actually very successfully navigated. Now speaking a little bit at least on what we look for the rest of the year and into next year. Jim, I'll turn that over to you, if I May? No, look, I appreciate the question very much, David. I think cement as a general rule and cement in Texas as a specific rule are probably two different things. And I think part of what gives us such confidence in the Texas market overall is that it's historically been the market place in which we've seen all the way through cycles, the single highest infrastructure percentage of our business. So when you're in Texas, you're riding on concrete roads and you're going across concrete bridges. And I think that's a really important component to remember when you think about what's happening in that marketplace. The other thing that we've spoken of, David, is really what the requirements are in that state, what the in-state production is in that state and where our plants are located. So if housing slowed to a degree, would that open up some powder, the answer is it probably would. Does that mean that people aren't going to be faced with tightness towards the end of the week and might be able to take more aggregates I think it probably does. So I do think Texas is a very different and it's an overused word, David, but I do think cement in Texas is relatively unique. The other thing that I'll point out that I think has been a big help for us as we've looked at our business over time is the fact is as we look at our reliability and as we look overall at the utilization, of our plants in Texas. They continue on a year-over-year basis to get better. So we're finding ourselves in a position in a market that's very tight that making the shift to Type 1L is going to add capacity, adding the new finish mill at Midlothian is going to add capacity. And the fact is, we're a better cement company now than we were last year, and we're going to be better next year than we are this year. So I think there are a number of components to it. But I do think the commercial aspects of it will continue to be very attractive and right now we've got a lot of resilience around what we're anticipating for 2023 in cement. Brent, thank you for the question. I think that's such an important one as we go through cycles because our capital priorities are changing. And part of what I find really compelling about Martin Marietta is the ability of this company after having done the most significant cash outlays in its history in M&A last year to be de-levered exactly the way that we anticipated we would be by the end of this year. Now if we think about M&A more broadly, here's what I'll say. A lot of potential deals have come through our funnel in the last 18 months. And what we're trying to be is what you would expect. And that is very disciplined in what we're looking at. We're looking at a number of different potential transactions today. They tend to be almost exclusively. It's not tended to be, they're almost exclusively aggregates-based deals. And those are the types of transactions that we're most interested in. You hear the way that we speak of our business, aggregates-led, strategic cement, targeted downstream. So to the extent that we can continue to grow our aggregates-led business, that's what we're going to want to do. part of what's different now, though, as we think about it, Brent, is our footprint is different. So we have the ability to look in markets that we could not have looked in before to do bolt-on. And the reason that I called that out is bolt-on, if you think about them from a risk allocation perspective are actually very low because you've got operating people in that market, you've got commercial people in that market. Integration can broadly occur over the course of a weekend, and the execution risk is really quite low. So do we continue to look at M&A? The answer is yes. Do I hope that we'll have some things to talk to you about late this year or early next year? I hope so. There are certainly no guarantees on that, but the aim is that we will continue to do that, and you should look for it to continue to be aggregates led. So I hope that's responsive. Yes. Good to hear your voice, and thanks for the question. I'm going to take part two and ask Jim to come back and deal with part one. So part two, we're not seeing significant cancellations on nonres projects. And frankly, that's not a big surprise to me. The only time in my career that I can remember that we saw that happen in notable ways was coming out of basically that 2005, 2006 where building was so robust and the fall was so precipitous that we saw nonres projects actually stopping or being canceled. As a general rule, they don't they tend to go through. So the short answer is we're not seeing that. The other part of your question is really the breakdown of what's heavy and non et cetera. So I'll turn that over to Jim. Those are great questions, Michael. So thank you for that. Do I think we're likely to see that type of a build on the public side? The short answer is, yes, I think we probably are. Do I think we're in a position and again, look, this is really ranked speculation so I don't want to get out there too far. I think we've got a good sense of what pricing will be in 2023. And of course, we tried to capture that in what we put out in our preliminary guidance. If we're right, and I believe that we are, that we obviously have a multi-year highway bill. If we're right, that the U.S. is far from overbuilt, if we're right that anything relative to housing will not be deep, it will not be long, and if we're right that the U.S. is going to have to look at higher degrees in particular manufacturing going forward, I think you could take a number of economic indicators in that vein and say that volumes should be relatively attractive on a broader base for an extended period of time. What we've seen relative to pricing, particularly in aggregates is aggregate pricing tends to be attractive even in a challenged volume environment. If we end up finding ourselves in a multiyear circumstance, that you could have flat next year up year after or however you want to fashion it, I do think that you could continue to see a very constructive pricing environment. Now obviously, that's not guidance. That's looking out farther than we would typically look at. Obviously, what we've given you so far is a preliminary view of 2023. But if I'm just taking what has been more years around this industry than on occasion, I'd like to admit, I think what I've just outlined for you would be consistent with broader history. I'm sorry, are we -- what today -- Adam, what is that? You know what? In some markets, I wouldn't call it a weakness, I would see the slowdown. And I know that's parsing things a little bit. But overall, the reason that I don't say weakness is they're still in our markets such an acute need. And I think that's the fundamental difference that we're seeing today. So are we seeing a slowdown in large measure because of logistics constraints and otherwise? Yes. Are most of our markets, in my view, more affected today by lack of availability as opposed to affordability? I think that is the bigger issue, Adam. I'm not going to totally dismiss affordability in some circumstances. I mean, let's face it, as a practical matter, we've got a lot more people in the United States and we have interest rates trending up to things that would have looked relatively normal a decade plus ago. So we're going to have to see where that goes. But the short answer is yes, we are seeing some degree of a slowdown. Nothing that we think is dramatic. In fact, we think it's actually quite expected and what we're seeing more broadly. But I do think this is going to be a circumstance where very specific geographies will respond very differently, in particular on single-family housing. Dillon, thank you for the question. The short answer is yes, we are assuming for purposes of next year that they continue to be constrained. We're assuming that degrees of constraints have been relieved but not at all wholly relieved. And keep in mind, we're going to benefit and we're going to have a burden depending on how things work, particularly relative to rail. As rail gets better, we're the largest shipper of stone by rail in the United States. So we will be a disproportionate beneficiary as that circumstance is inevitably righted. At the same time, when it's struggling, we're going to feel it a bit more acutely, and that's where we've been over the last several quarters. So do we think it's going to be completely remedied next year? No. Do we think it's likely to be better? Yes. Do we see it getting better in the second half of this year than it was earlier? Yes. So that gives us a certain degree of resilience around our view on that next year. But that's how we're at least still and we're trying to frame that more broadly. Again, thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence, and remain focused on executing our strategic plan. Martin Marietta's track record of success throughout various business cycles and our ability to adapt to the various challenges inherent in the current macroeconomic environment proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates-led business model. We're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhance shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results with you in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward. And good morning to everyone. The building materials business posted an all-time record this quarter, with products and services revenues of $1.61 billion, a 15.9% increase over last year, and an adjusted product gross profit record of $467 million, an increase of 10.9%. Adjusted aggregates product gross profit improved 10.5% relative to the prior year's quarter to a record $330 million. Adjusted aggregate product gross margin declined 240 basis points to 32.5% as robust pricing growth had not yet offset the continued inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, repairs and maintenance costs. Our Texas cement business delivered all time, quarterly records for top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 23.4% to $163 million, while gross profit increased 35.7% to $68 million. Importantly, execution of a discipline commercial strategy drove a gross margin expansion of 380 basis points to 41.5%. That was despite notable energy costs headwinds, primarily related to natural gas and electricity. Domestic production capacity constraints and strong demand contributes to extremely tight supply in the North and Central Texas markets. As a reminder, we are taking two notables, near term steps to increase cement production capacity in Texas. First, we're in the midst of conversions at our Midlothian and Hunter plant to manufacture a less carbon intensive Portland limestone cement, also known as Type 1L. This eco-friendly product has been approved by the Texas Department of Transportation, and we believe our customers will view it as providing significant stakeholder benefits. Once we have completed our transition to Type 1L, our cement production capacity will increase by approximately 10%. Second, we are installing a new finish mill at our Midlothian plant, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2023. This new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of much needed incremental production capacity to the Texas marketplace. Our third quarter ready-mixed concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1, and include the acquired Arizona operations impacting the comparability with the prior year quarter. On an as reported basis, ready-mixed concrete product revenues declined 29.1% to $227 million, and gross profit declined 40.3% to $90 million, driven primarily by the divestiture which was partially offset by contributions from the acquired operations. Increased raw material costs further weighed on the gross margin for the quarter. Our asphalt and paving results include the operations acquired on the West Coast, impacting comparability with the prior year quarter. On an as reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions led to record revenues of $310 million, a 58.1% increase and record adjusted gross profit of $50 million, a 22.9% increase, however, continued liquid asphalt inflation contributed to the adjusted product gross margin decline of 470 basis points to 16.3%. Magnesia specialties generated product revenues of $69 million, a 4% decrease, driven largely by lower demand for domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products. Product gross profit declined 22.9% to $22 million, as higher energy costs resulted in gross margin compression of 770 basis points to 31.3%. On a consolidated basis, other operating income net included $50 million in nonrecurring gains from the sale of surplus land and other assets. We saw sequential moderation in diesel costs in the third quarter. During the month of October, diesel prices have trended back up. While we anticipate additional volatility in diesel prices. We are forecasting that fourth quarter prices approximate current levels. As a result, with diesel costs no longer increasing sequentially, coupled with our discipline pricing initiatives, we expect to return to expanding gross margins in the fourth quarter as compared with the prior year period. We remain focused on a disciplined execution of our strategic plan to responsibly grow through acquisitions and reinvest in the business, while also returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $141 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 288,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $347 per share in the third quarter. We also reduced gross leverage this past quarter. On September 29, the company utilized cash on the balance sheet to satisfy and discharge a $700 million tranche of senior notes due July 2023. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued to trend down and ended the quarter at 2.6x. We continue to anticipate a return to the top end of our target net leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x by year end. Additionally, the company's board of directors approved an 8% increase in a quarterly cash dividend paid in September underscoring its confidence in our future performance and free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend is now $2.64 per share. Since our repurchased authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends, as well as share repurchases. As detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2022 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results as well as the impact of lower expected aggregate volumes and continued inflationary pressure. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range from $1, 610 million to $1,675 million which excludes the nonrecurring gain on the divestiture in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward. Sure. So the energy cost for the full year headwind, we're expecting in 2022 is about $190 million or so, give or take, that's a full year view. At this point, we're not assuming those get better or worse next year. They stay elevated, but they don't improve, they don't get worse. So that's a big probably the most volatile of our cost components. Labor stays relatively well behaved. That's our biggest, single biggest cost component at about 20-ish percent. That's going to be maybe a little bit above average, but not too bad. What is growing of late, and I expect to continue into next year, supplies, repairs expense and contract services, those will grow a little bit faster as they have this quarter into next year. But I think all that said, our ASP growth should surpass that cost inflation in 2023. Yes. So Garik, the heavy portion of nonres is 55%, the light portion is 45%. Yes. It's Jim. Happy to take that question. The reduction in CapEx this year was simply just taking longer to get the money deployed than we had expected earlier in the year. There are no other reasons in the past, frankly. So it's just a reflection of what we think we can get done this year. As for next year, I typically guide focused about 9% of revenues. I think that holds true for next year. So sort of steady as she goes for us, and I would expect the same thing next year at about 9% of sales. Does that answer your question?"

Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation, after which Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jenny, and welcome to Martin Marietta. And good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report the record results that Martin Marietta delivered in the second quarter, extending our strong track record of commercial excellence, profitable growth and disciplined execution of our strategic plan. In light of the challenging macroeconomic environment, including the rapid acceleration of key input costs, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus, ability to respond quickly and appropriately to changing dynamics and the resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our impressive results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also closed 2 previously announced downstream divestitures in the quarter. These transactions further enhance our company's margin profile, both near and long term while strengthening Martin Marietta's balance sheet and further improving the durability of our business through cycles. Our first half performance, coupled with these strategic divestitures, provide an even more attractive foundation for accelerated growth in the second half of 2022 and beyond. As highlighted in today's release we achieved a number of significant financial and operating records in the second quarter, a few specific examples include: consolidated total revenues increased 19% to $1.64 billion, consolidated gross profit increased 10% to $425 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $478 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.96. Our strong performance was due in large part to the diligent execution of our value over volume commercial strategy following the implementation of our April 1 price increases, widespread product demand across our coast-to-coast footprint and contributions from acquisitions. However, we were not immune to high input cost inflation, and as such, gross margins declined slightly. Notably, our teams are taking actions to mitigate the impacts of this historic inflation by implementing third quarter price increases broadly across products and geographies, which primarily take effect between July 1 and September 1. Additionally, we're advising customers of a fourth quarter price increase in a number of our markets. We believe these commercial initiatives, together with other operational inflation management actions position Martin Marietta well to benefit in the near term from anticipated record second half pricing growth rates. Continued product demand, together with customer preference for material quality and availability, is expected to support an extended favorable pricing environment. We're well positioned to produce quality products, meeting this demand as a result of recent and ongoing capital investments as well as focused operational improvements at our key facilities. It's important to remember that historically, inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials, the benefits of which endure a long after other inflationary pressures abate. While we typically invest in our business for growth, we also review the overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value through either monetizing or exchanging select assets where we may not be the best owners. Consistent with that approach, on April 1, we closed the sale of our Colorado and Central Texas ready-mixed concrete businesses to Suburban Ready Mix and on June 30, we completed the previously announced sale of our Reading cement plant, its related distribution terminals and certain California concrete operations to CalPortland Company. Together, these margin-accretive portfolio refinements enhance the overall durability of our business and provide Martin Marietta with the balance sheet flexibility to increase shareholder value by redeploying proceeds into future aggregates-led acquisitions. We're focused on continuing our organic growth improvements and initiatives while returning capital to shareholders and reducing our net leverage to within our targeted range. Let's now turn to our second quarter operating performance, starting with aggregates. We continue to experience healthy aggregates demand across our 3 primary end markets, with total aggregate shipments, inclusive of acquisitions, increasing over 9% to a second quarter record of 57.8 million tons. Organic aggregate shipments increased 1.8% despite numerous supply chain and logistics issues governing the overall pace of construction activity. Additionally, in key Sunbelt markets, cement shortages negatively impacted our ready-mix concrete customers thereby, constraining aggregate shipments to that segment. Organic aggregates pricing increased 8.8% or 7.5% on a mix-adjusted basis, as our April 1 increase is built upon our first quarter pricing momentum based on high demand and increased costs. The Texas cement market is experiencing robust demand and tight supply. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record quarterly shipments of 1.1 million tons and pricing growth of 14.7% as our $12 per ton increase went into effect on April 1. The market conditions in Texas, together with ongoing import challenges in Martin Marietta's core cement regions of Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, set the stage for further pricing actions this year, including a second $12 per ton price increase that was effective as of July 1. The outlook for Texas cement remains extremely attractive for the foreseeable future. Shifting to our downstream businesses. Organic ready-mix concrete shipments increased 3.4%, reflecting strong product demand in the Texas Triangle, partially offset by the previously mentioned cement tightness. Organic pricing grew a robust 17%, reflecting multiple pricing actions, including fuel surcharges, which have passed through raw material and other inflationary cost pressures. Organic asphalt shipments were effectively flat as strong demand in Denver was offset by a later-than-usual start to the construction season in Minneapolis, while organic pricing improved 17%, following the increase in raw materials costs, principally bitumen. Including contributions from our acquired operations in California and Arizona, asphalt shipments increased 40%. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic operating environment and the impact on housing starts, inflation and interest rates, Martin Marietta continued to experience strong second quarter product demand across our geographic footprint. As we entered the third quarter, customer backlogs are firmly ahead of prior year levels with logistics challenges serving as the primary governor to the cadence of product shipments. As we examine each of the company's 3 primary end users, the combined outlook for continued aggregates demand is attractive as robust infrastructure funding and secular nonresidential demand trends are expected to more than offset any potential affordability-driven air pocket in today's historically underbuilt residential segment. With that backdrop, let's now turn to an end-use overview, starting with infrastructure. We're on the cusp of increased levels of infrastructure investment not seen in the United States since the introduction of the interstate highway system in 1956 as already healthy state Department of Transportation budgets receive incremental federal funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, allocations for the 2023 fiscal year, most of which began on July 1. As a result, we expect aggregates demand benefits will begin to accrue later this calendar year with a more pronounced expansion in 2023. Importantly, this increased investment in public works provides a base level of stable demand for our products for years to come. Similar to infrastructure, non-residential construction in Martin Marietta markets should continue to be an area of strength as pandemic impacted sectors, including like commercial, retail, hospitality and energy recover from their pandemic troughs and supply chain disruptions, lead businesses to establish manufacturing facilities closer to in demand. We've seen a notable acceleration and announcements of large aggregates intensive domestic manufacturing facilities. Some examples of these projects in our markets include: the Samsung semiconductor facility in Austin, the Stellantis Samsung joint venture lithium-ion battery plant near Indianapolis, the Taiwan Semiconductor campus near Phoenix and the Vinfast electric vehicle site near Raleigh-Durham. Relative to pandemic accelerated growth sectors, warehouses and data centers are currently experiencing different impacts, starting with warehouses, consistent with Amazon's public announcement in April. We expect a moderation in their rapid square footage growth rate. However, we're continuing to shift to their end process projects. Importantly, though, we're experiencing an uptick in warehouse and cold storage construction from businesses other than Amazon as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and grocers adapt to a secular shift and consumers' preference for delivered goods. Additionally, data center demand remains robust, including meta data center projects in Kansas City and Atlanta, which were well positioned to serve from our nearby locations. With respect to the residential end use, location is always the essential factor. We've been purposeful and intentional in positioning our business in geographies where home prices are comparatively affordable and residential demand is far greater than supply due to a decade of underbuilding amid significant population inflows. As such, we expect the current housing slowdown to be: one, moderate in our key metropolitan areas as home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium; and two, constructive for continued single-family community development in more affordable suburban areas.  As shown in our supplemental information slides, it's important to be mindful that even with June slowdown in housing, single-family housing starts remain at approximately $1 million on a seasonally adjusted basis, which, in our view, is a healthy level and supportive of continued aggregates demand to both the direct residential sector as well as the ancillary construction that suburban community development requires. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and provide some context for our updated full year guidance. Jim?\nJim Nickolas : Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. As noted in our earnings release, for our continuing operations, the Building Materials business posted an all-time record this quarter, with products and services revenues of $1.45 billion, an 18.3% increase over last year and a second quarter product gross profit record of $401 million, an increase of 12.3%. All-time [record] aggregates gross profit of $309 million improved 13.2% relative to the prior year's quarter. Product gross margin declined 170 basis points to 32.3% as robust pricing growth was not quite enough to offset the inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, contract services and supplies expenses. Cement continues to deliver exceptional top and bottom-line results. Execution of a disciplined commercial strategy drove a gross margin expansion of 140 basis points to 32.4% despite sizable energy cost headwinds and as well as unplanned kiln outages at both the Midlothian and Hunter plants. Domestic production capacity constraints are exacerbating and otherwise already sold-out Texas market, contributing to extremely tight supply and resulting in a marketplace that is on allocation. Importantly, we are taking steps to increase cement production capacity in Texas. Those efforts resulted in setting an all-time quarterly record for cement shipments. In the short run, continued conversion of Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is creating incremental capacity for us. We expect between 25% and 30% of our historical Type 1 and Type 2 ship volumes to be converted to plc in the second half of this year. Many of you are aware, but it bears repeating that PLC is an innovative product that contains between 5% and 15% limestones and performs as well as standard cement, but with a lower carbon intensity. In the medium term, we expect to have our new Midlothian finish mill completed in late 2023, early 2024. This will provide 450,000 tons of much net incremental capacity to the Texas marketplace. As a reminder, our second quarter ready-mix concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1 and include the acquired Arizona operations, impacting the comparability to the prior year quarter. On an as-reported basis, ready-mix concrete revenues were down 15.8% as lower shipments due to the divestiture were partially offset by higher ASP. Gross profit declined $5 million to $14 million, and gross margin declined 80 basis points to 6.3% due to higher raw material and diesel costs. Our asphalt and paving results include the operations acquired on the West Coast, impacting comparability to the prior quarter. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions were not enough to offset the rapid increase in liquid asphalt raw material costs in the second quarter. As a result, gross profit declined $2 million to $26 million and gross profit margins declined 880 basis points. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from strong global demand for batteries as one of its chemicals line of products is used in cobalt extraction. This business generated record quarterly product revenues of $75 million, a 7% increase. However, due to the second quarter's rapid escalation in energy costs, gross margins contracted to a still impressive 34.6%. Higher energy costs are common then this quarter. However, we do not believe they will remain permanently elevated. If diesel fuel costs return to 2021 levels when West Texas intermediate crude sold for an average of $68 per barrel, our aggregates gross margin would expand by approximately 200 basis points. To be clear, we are forecasting diesel prices to remain flat with current levels for the rest of the year. However, we did want to provide context for the impact on margins when diesel costs ultimately subside. It is important to note that as indicated in our supplemental information slides, hopefully half of our aggregate pipeline costs have not increased at rates above historical trends. For example, personnel, depreciation and other expenses combined have remained generally in line with historical levels. While interest expense does not impact production costs, it does impact earnings. So I will briefly touch on that given the rapid rise in interest rates this year. In short, our borrowing costs are 100% fixed, eliminating direct exposure to rising interest rates. On a consolidated basis, other operating income net included $152 million of gain on the divestiture of the Colorado and Central Texas ready-mixed concrete operations. During the first half of the year, we returned $127 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We continue to anticipate a return to our target net leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x by year-end. Excluding the $152 million divestiture gain, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7x as of June 30. We remain diligent in the steadfast execution of our store priorities, focusing on allocating capital in a responsible, diligent and comprehensive manner to high-return initiatives that create value for shareholders. We plan to use the proceeds from our recently completed cement and concrete divestitures to further our long-standing capital allocation priorities. These include: prudently investing in value-enhancing aggregates-led acquisitions and organic growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders, all within the framework of maintaining a durable and resilient balance sheet. And as detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2020 guidance to reflect our first half results, expected second half pricing cadence as well as the overall macroeconomic operating environment as we anticipate continued inflationary pressure and volume constraints driven by continued supply chain and logistics challenges. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range $1.670 billion to $1.750 billion. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We're well positioned to capitalize on the strong product demand trends across our coast-to-coast geographic footprint as increased infrastructure investment, along with the recovery in light nonresidential construction, large-scale energy projects and domestic manufacturing is expected to largely insulate product shipments from any near-term affordability driven headwinds in residential end markets. Our team remains committed to the health and safety of our community, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: Nice results in the quarter, especially given the cost headwinds. And I want to touch on the price acceleration in the quarter for both aggregates and cement, if we could, which is especially nice to see given the input and energy-related inflation that everybody is facing. And in your deck, Slide 4 implies that the pricing acceleration should strengthen even further in the back half of this year to a level I don't think I've seen in my career. So Ward, I want to ask if you could dive in a little deeper around the dynamics at play here and really what gives you confidence in this aggregates and cement price outlook for the back half? And also just what that could mean for profitability as we progress through the year and into '23?\nWard Nye: Trey, thank you for the question. Look, you're seeing something you haven't seen in your career and I am, too. And that is the way pricing is working is really just extraordinary. And party goes back to some of the commentary we discussed at the end of Q1, and that was we're seeing this in many respects as the best single commercial pricing environment that I think we've seen in a generation or 2. If we look at what's happened so far, and I think it does give you a nice build in the supplemental slides from Slide 4. We've seen very nice aggregates and cement pricing through Q2. We've seen broad midyear increases that have gone in. They've been implemented as of July 1. What we're seeing in July on those price increases looks very attractive. So to your point, what gives us confidence in this outlook? It's really seeing what we've seen so far in July, even building on what we've seen strongly throughout the year so far. What we anticipate is aggregates pricing here in the second half is going to be an exit rate that's really going to be at about 14.5%. I mean that's a really attractive number. We think cement can be -- it's something that feels more like 21.5%. So as we think about those exit rates, to your point, this year going into next year, it gives me 2 very base impressions: number one, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're going to have a record year; number two, as we go into next year, we're going to have what we anticipate to be another very attractive year. And the other thing that I think is worth noting, Trey, is a lot of what's driving pricing right now is clearly what's happening with energy. But as you know, having watched this space for a long time, energy tends to subside at some point. At the same time, heavy side upstream material pricing usually does not. So again, I think from an inflation management perspective, the team has done an extraordinary job, and I really appreciate your comments.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Elliott Stanley with Stifel.\nElliott Stanley : Quick question for you. So the updated guide does take volumes down a touch in the second half. You mentioned volume constraints, logistics, was there anything else in there? And then maybe if you could kind of frame that, provide a little color on the backlog, which you mentioned were up on a year-over-year basis and just how we should think about that building into '23?\nWard Nye: No, happy to Stanley. Thank you for the question. I think several things are properly relevant. Number one, are contractors continuing to hire to the extent that they can? Yes. So is that a modest constraint that we see getting better? Sure. Is trucking still in some markets a constraint because of the availability of drivers? Absolutely. I think if you look at the overall public numbers from the railroads as well, it's getting better, but it hasn't been as fluid, I think, as they would have hoped. Here's something else though, that I think is really worth noting, and that is, in a lot of markets, cement is on allocation. So think about what that means as products roll through the process. If ready-mix producers can't get cement later in the week, the fact is they're not going to put down ready-mix concrete, which means they're not going to bring in aggregates. So the fact is that a really tight cement market in some markets can also have a bit of a governor on what overall aggregates growth looks like. So as we're looking at the back half of the year, those are some of the things that we've taken into account as we think about volumes. Now to your point, if we also try to consider what our customers' backlogs look like the customer backlogs are really quite good, and we're pretty heartened by that. What we're seeing right now is, overall in aggregates, the backlogs are about 9% ahead of where they were at prior year levels. So those are pretty heady numbers. What I like in particular is some of the wear on that. So if we look in the East division, which, as you know, is one of our very profitable divisions, that's up about 13% over where it was prior year. But here's one that's really notable, and that is in the Central division, now some of this is impacted by our acquisition of Tiller last year, but Central divisions up about 30%. And then even as we look at West Group, and again, you've heard the numbers on what's happening in the West, particularly in Texas, for example, in cement, that markets is sold out. We're basically seeing backlogs in that market broadly where they were prior year. And even in Southwest ready mix, we're seeing, again, backlog is very consistent, but bidding is remaining very strong. throughout the markets that are so core to us in DFW, Austin and San Antonio. So I hope that's responsive to your question on what we see on volumes and some of the why. But importantly, what we see on customer backlog and in summary, and what gives us that nice confidence as we look out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Gainey with Thompson Davis.\nKevin Gainey: Maybe I was going to see if you guys could touch on energy headwinds for '22 at maybe a high level? And then maybe discuss what you're thinking as far as the out years, what could happen with aggregate prices and as energy costs come down as such?\nWard Nye: Kevin, look, that's actually a great question and really nails much of what the story has been this year. So here's the quick take on that question. If we look at the full year, and take a look not just at the organic business, but the all-in business that we have, and we try to compare this year to last year relative to energy costs, the headline number is, we're going to have about $200 million of energy cost this year that we didn't have last year. So what I think is so important to do is to contextualize what I think has been superb performance by our team this year. We've got a $200 million headwind and we're talking about making $1.7 billion. So let's keep that in mind. Now to your point, I'm not going to prognosticate on when we're going to see energy start to subside. But if past is prologue, we're going to see that subside over time. To the other part of your question, we typically do not see average selling prices in these substream products, primarily, I'm saying aggregates and in cement, subside the way that we think we're going to see energy come down. So again, if we're taking that $200 million headwind and then back away and say, but ballpark, half of that ish is going to be what's happening in diesel fuel. Because, again, if we just take a look overall at what we're utilizing in diesel, we're going to be somewhere between 54 million and 55 million gallons of diesel fuel usage during the course of the year. So I think that at least sets the table on what the headline number is, how much of it's diesel. Obviously, there are going to be components of it that are natural gas and electricity. And by the way, every one of those is up pretty considerably from where they were in Q1 and our forecast takes that into account going forward. So I hope that helps.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.\nBrian Biros: This is Brian Biros on for Kathryn. On infrastructure, clearly ramping up nicely in states from a project momentum standpoint. How are you managing inflation in this backdrop? And are you seeing any changes in bid activity?\nWard Nye: Brian, thank you for the question. Primarily, we're managing inflation in 2 different ways. I mean, you've seen what we're doing commercially to help manage inflation. The other thing that we're doing is making sure that we continue to strive for operational excellence to lower cost per ton in as many other ways as we possibly can. And we feel like the combination of those 2 things will likely lead to margin expansion, particularly beginning as we look at Q4 this year and into next year. As we look at the way DOTs are reacting, I think it's important to state, we're not seeing DOTs cancel any projects. I think on some occasions, we're seeing DOTs postponed some projects. And I think this is the notion. They're seeing very high, in particular, bitumen or liquid asphalt pricing. I think their hope is that they will see that pull back to some degree. I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is if you're looking at DOT pricing on projects that may have been done, what do we want to say, 6, 7, 8, 9 months ago, the fact is the cost input on projects today is so fundamentally different for contractors than it was during that time frame. It's not unusual for contractors to be coming in with numbers that are ahead of engineers' estimates. When that happens, that oftentimes dictates a rebidding anyway. So I think what we're seeing to a varying degree is in DOTs are being proactive, looking at numbers again, seeing what's realistic and then putting that out. Because I think part of what's important to keep in mind, Brian, is in the Martin Marietta states that have seen significant population inflows, legislatures and governors want to see this work go. So the fact is we're not seeing things canceled. We've seen in some places, things postponed. We think that actually plays out very nicely for us because as you see, we're more focused on value over volume anyway. And we think this actually plays out comfortably as we roll into '23 and the years after. So Brian, I hope that helps, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich : I'm wondering if you can talk about the gross margin cadence for the aggregates line of business. It looks like based on the full year guide, you might be exiting the year, up 100, 200 basis points year-over-year and carrying that momentum into '23. Is that right? Can you just factor on that? And also just in the interest of setting expectations, for '23, consensus earnings estimates are looking for a 30% growth next year and a pretty mixed economic environment. So just in the interest of setting you up folks for success, as you said, initial '23 guidance in the coming quarters, any interest in commenting around moving pieces around '23.\nWard Nye: Jerry, thank you so much. And what I'll say is we will obviously give you much more color into '23 as we get closer to the end of this year. And obviously, when we get into February next year, we'll be very granular on it. I think, as we said, we certainly anticipate exiting the year at some very attractive exit rates relative to ASPs. We think we've got a -- we know we have a good handle on our cost profile. What I'll do is I'll turn to Jim to ask him to respond very specifically to some of your margin questions. So Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So yes, you're right, Jerry. We're looking at Q4 at a consolidated level being more profitable than prior year Q4. And that also applies, of course, to the aggregates business, which is the main business. Aggregates and cement, Q4 should continue the upward trajectory that we've seen, we expect to see. And at that point, we think they're outpacing cost inflation. Now again, that assumes we don't see a resumption of the rapid increases that we saw in the second quarter. We don't expect that to happen. So we think what we're forecasting will come to pass. And again, the ASP growth rate that we've projected will more than offset the cost growth that we're expecting as well. So by and large, yes, getting better each quarter here and out in Q4, in particular, will be meaningfully better than the prior Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] starting on for Anthony. When we think about the kind of light commercial work that generally follows 6 to 12 months after housing, if housing slows now, is there a potential for that commercial work that's currently [indiscernible] being interrupted? What do you expect that continue following, sort of asking another way, is this 6 to 12-month lag time the same on the down cycle as it is sort of on the up cycle? Or could that shorten?\nWard Nye: Thank you for the question. I'm going to answer the last part of it first, and that is typically the lag is about the same. In other words, if housing slows in markets, it would take several months, 6, 9, in some places, 12 for commercial to slow. Our view is we're really not seeing that. I mean, if we're looking at nonres in our markets, part of what we try to call out and you see it and the CEO commentary, among others. I outlined very specifically 5 different nonres projects that are relatively new, except for the 1 energy sector project that was called out that we see evolving. And again, those were Campo Commerce in South Carolina, Meta Data Center in Kansas City, the Samsung projects in Austin and the High Point Logistics Park in Aurora, Colorado. So what we're seeing in that dimension is actually quite attractive. There are 2 other things that I think are worth keeping in mind: number one, we're seeing the activity relative to chips that you saw come out of a relatively bipartisan vote in the Senate yesterday. If the house moves forward with that, that will clearly dictate more manufacturing here in the United States. I think much of that will likely occur in coastal areas where we tend to have a very attractive footprint. The other piece of it that I think is likely to be even more attractive, and this is more on heavy size than the line side is what we anticipate happening with energy. And I think energy can frankly be twofold: number one, we've long talked about those large LNG project pipeline projects that we see in South Texas and Louisiana. It's worth noting, as we've looked at those in the past, we've talked about the potential if those projects come to bear of around 13.5 million tons of aggregates that are tied to those different jobs and about 770,000 cubic yards of ready-mix. The updated numbers on those, to give you a sense of it, aggregates has gone from 13.5 million requirements to what looks like now it's closer to 19 million tons of requirements. The cubic yardage of ready-mix has gone from 770,000 to now 920,000. So again, I think nonres moves around a little bit. That's on energy in South Texas. Again, if some of these bills go through, and frankly, from a Martin Marietta perspective, if we see more wind energy in places like the Midwest, keep in mind, those tend to be very aggregates intensive jobs as well. So if we're looking at cold storage, if we're looking at warehousing, if we're looking at energy, if we're looking at degrees of more manufacturing in the United States, and we continue to have the population trends that we're seeing in Martin Marietta states of moment, meaning Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, et cetera. We think, number one, residential is going to stay very resilient for us. We think the white nonres that follows that is going to be good. And we think these components of heavy nonres can actually be very attractive, and there are also going to be very aggregates intensive.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist.\nKeith Hughes: My question is on natural gas. It's been on a quite a rollercoaster ride the last couple of months. If you could just talk about how quickly you feel that in your operations? Is it real time? Is there a lag? Unfortunately, I think maybe for more volatility in the next 3 or 4 months.\nWard Nye: Keith, thank you for the question. And look, energy has been all over the place you would imagine. And obviously, we're just looking broadly at energy. Obviously, we said we got a $200 million headwind this year. We said about half of that is really going to be attributable to diesel fuel. If we're looking at really how much we move things around on natural gas since the last time we looked to that. I'm going to ask Jim to come back and speak specifically to that because he can give you a sense of the volatility on that. Relative to natural gas, there's really not a lot of other hedging or otherwise that goes on in that. So it is relatively real time. But Jim, over to you.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So of the headwind -- the $200 million headwind this year versus last year, $100 million in diesels, it's worth mentioning $50 million is natural gas. So it's meaningful to our operations. To answer your question, it is the most volatile of the energy costs we've got right now. And I think our ability to react to it is similar to our diesel approach, we'll have to react to it in the form of higher pricing and there's a bit of a lag to that typically. It can be depending on the business anywhere from 3 to 6 months before we get that, that pricing reflected in the as we manage against those higher costs. So we're on it. We're kind of paying attention to it. It remains elevated volatility. So that's just a thing we're keeping an eye on.\nWard Nye: And Keith, just to put 1 more bit of data here. If we're looking at Q2 last year to Q2 this year and the increase on a percentage basis in nat gas, it's up about 66%. If we're looking at it more sequentially on where it was in Q1 versus where it was in Q2, up about 10%. So at least you're seeing a pullback in those percentage increases.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Roger with Exane PNB Paribas.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is George on the line for Paul. Changing tune a little bit. Do you mind just giving a bit of color on your decarbonization strategy for the 2 cement plants and maybe a bit of an indication of what that might cost? Clearly, in Europe, we've got a bit of a head start on CO2. So just wondering if you have any concerns that you might be a bit behind the curve there.\nWard Nye: George, thank you first for the question. I appreciate that very much. I guess several things that I would say. If you look at overall of what we've done relative to decarbonization, we've been looking at alternative fuels. We've been looking at that at both of our facilities, for example, if we look at the way that we're operating our plant in Midlothian, which is in North Texas, we're using tardive fuels for a good bit of that process right now. Overall, what's going to have to happen to really see significant decarbonization is we're going to have to see products and plans that can be used very broadly at a commercial level. I think if we actually look at the decarbonization of our plants and we go apples-to-apples, not apples to oranges relative to the performance that our plants have in the United States relative to most of the performance that we see from a carbon footprint perspective globally. I actually don't think we're behind on that. I think if you look at the sustainability report that we published in April, in which we went to great pains to outline what the different blending mechanisms can be and really how those scores are kept. I think you'll see that we're actually in a very, very good place. The other thing that's worth noting is if we go back in time and take a look at the capital that has gone into that strategic cement footprint that we have in Texas since 2014, we put about $1 billion worth of CapEx into that business. So what I think is fair to say is we've got a very attractive cement business in Texas. That is what we've been designed toward building as you'll see the margins in that business look and feel like the margins do in our aggregates business. That was part of our plan. And at least going forward, our ability to invest in that facility to utilize PLC cement, which Jim referenced in his prepared remarks, we think actually has us in a very attractive place. And we think we're going to be in a position to move as we need to: one, as a business; and two, is a very good community steward going forward to make sure that we can have the types of returns in that business that our shareholders expect and at the same time, make sure that we're the neighbor that people want us to be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.\nPhil Ng: I guess with recession fears dialing up here and the potential air pocket in housing, certainly healthy debate among investors how nonres would hold up next year. You've certainly highlighted some unique opportunities for Martin Marietta. Curious, how much line of sight do you have because that's a longer backlog business? And do you see some of these energy projects kind of start to kick in next year?\nWard Nye: Phil, thanks for the question. Good to hear your voice. And the short answer is we've actually got pretty good line of sight on the nonres. These tend to be particularly on these larger manufacturing type facilities, big jobs as a consequence of the size of the jobs. The owners are out, they are talking to generals and suppliers as well. Part of what we're seeing now is people are thinking about notices to proceed. They're giving us dates on when they think that's going to occur, that's occurring on a number of these large LNG project pipelines. It's also occurring on a number of those jobs that we outlined in the commentary that was published with our release today. I mean, part of what's striking to me is we look at some of these semiconductor facilities or others. I mean, these are enormous facilities, and we spoke not this past February, but the February before at Investor Day, how much size actually dictates more than dollars the aggregates intensity on these projects? So I think your point is a really good one and that is not all markets are going to be treated equally as we go through whatever the next several months maybe. And again, if we're simply looking at nonres and frankly, if we go through it on a stop light basis and go red, green, yellow, we're seeing a lot of green on nonres as we go through our top 6 states. And frankly, I'll tell you as I look at it today from a non-res perspective, they're all green right now.\nPhil Ng: Okay. So if we kind of combine that with the momentum you're seeing on infrastructure in a moderate recession, do you think you have enough levers for volumes to be up next year for [indiscernible] and your Texas Cement business?\nWard Nye: Ask that question again, you said between the infrastructure and say it again. I didn't hear it, Phil.\nPhil Ng: Just given what you're seeing in nonres and certainly infrastructure dialing up, in a moderate recession world, do you think you have enough levers for aggregates and cement to be off next year in a moderate type recession?\nWard Nye: Look, we'll obviously come out and give very detailed guidance on that at some point. But here's what I would say, Phil. Look, this infrastructure bill is up considerably. The states in which we operate are in a very good budget perspective. You've probably seen what I have, and that is states like North Carolina that are looking forward ahead are now in the latest budget that's been approved saying we're going to take a certain percentage of sales taxes and putting that to infrastructure. Obviously, if we're looking at population trends in our key states, the trends themselves have been quite attractive. I think what people are looking for, Phil, at the end of the day, is in a volatile time, what looks safe. And I think one of the things that this management team believes is that we have built a very durable business, a business that has the capacity and enough market to outperform and ability that as we go through cycles, we'll continue to outperform. And it's not just that we have a durable business. We built a durable business in markets that we think will outperform. So obviously, we'll give you more, but I'm trying to give you some data around what gives us such confidence going into next year, and we'll give you more detail as we get closer. But we're not seeing anything in '23. As we look at it broadly, that scares us right now.\nPhil Ng: Yes, that's great. That's helpful. And certainly, a lot of carryover fraction going into next year as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: Ward, just maybe to build on the previous question, 2023, looking like it could be an awfully strong year. You bring in the state funding that you referenced a moment ago. You layer in on top of that the IIJ projects, which really should be building relatively well from a momentum standpoint in 2023. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, in the absence of some really deeply recessionary impact on the market, a very tight cement market is going to get even tighter. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of a constraint to aggregate shipments that might represent? And what percentage of your total aggregate flow would be influenced by a cement supply constraint?\nWard Nye: David, that's a great question. And I think you just saw it this quarter. I mean, I think it constrains it. I think it makes it modestly tighter. I don't think it does horribly shocking things to it. Because what happens, David, is different states are going to react very differently to a cement shortage. So here's a good way to think of it. Obviously, Texas is the big cement-producing state. It has a number of facilities there. We're the largest cement producer in Texas. If we come here to our backyard in North Carolina, there's not a cement plant to be found in the entire state because it's largely a granite state. And where we do have limestone that can meet the criteria that you would need with high calcium carbonate, it's going to be in the eastern part of the state, and it's going to be so difficult to access that you don't have a meaningful cement plan in the state. At the same time, we don't see concrete acting remarkably different here that is in places like Texas today. So again, David, I would call it more on the margin, it's going to be something that we might talk about and could slow it down to a degree. It's not going to be something that if I'm sitting where you are sitting or frankly, where I'm sitting, that I'm going to have a great degree of concern about in large measure because the work is not going to go away. The work is likely just to be pushed to the side. And one of the things that I think we recognize is in a circumstance in which materials can be tight, again, it's a very attractive commercial environment for us. So I don't think it's going to be horribly meaningful on the volume. It will be modestly. I think it's going to be more meaningful positively on the ASP.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas : So Ward, could you maybe assess how your acquired properties and assets have been performing over the last -- during 2022? And maybe how you get a sense of how the California market is shaping up? And could that provide some stability or some upside on the nonres and cement front?\nWard Nye: Mike, thanks so much for that question. Happy to. So we'll break it really into 2 material buckets. Let's talk first about the Lehigh assets in the West. So we're not seeing anything that we've been surprised by, and that is these assets have substantial earnings growth and ASP potential that's frankly in the process of being unlocked. So what I would ask you to do is go back and reflect on the way, in many respects, the TXI came into the business and the way that it's performed since then. As you may recall, the single quickest wins that we saw in TXI was really relative to ASP. That's what we're seeing right now in California as well. January 1 price increases on aggregates were up double digit. July 1 midyear increases in large measure, $2 per ton across much of California. And you can also see that we're going through in a very orderly way in looking at the portfolio and making sure that we're keeping what's core to us, where we, in fact, are the best owners. So we're in the process of doing that. I think it's actually gone quite well. So we're not seeing anything in California or Arizona that's been a surprise to us. Frankly, on some days, I'm sure to wish I could get more cement in Arizona, but I will also concede that's a high-class problem in many respects. As we think about the Tiller assets, and as you recall, we bought those just modestly ahead of the Hanson assets last year. Part of what we really like about that business is very limited CapEx requirements in that business. So part of what we're seeing there, these assets are going to be some of the best in portfolio from a cash flow perspective. And we think that's likely to be the case for years to come. The other thing that's been attractive to us, and it's really helped us come back and make sure that we have the investment there that's going to be really attractive for us is Tiller had a good bit of reclaimed land that was available for sale of the transaction. And we've been in the process of monetizing that, frankly, faster than we would have thought at higher valuations than we would have thought. And basically, we're able to take a net purchase price reduction as we go through that. So as we're looking at a very nice operating business in Tiller, it's performing well. Obviously, it's a business that's largely in Minnesota. So as people saw this past year, don't expect much of that in January, February and March because, well, it's cold in Minnesota in January and February and March. But the business is doing quite well. Hansen is doing very predictably, and we feel very good about where that business will go. We've got a very capable management team that's overseeing it, and we continue to be excited about now what is a very meaningful coast-to-coast aggregates led footprint.\nMichael Dudas : And this still is a beautiful state work.\nWard Nye: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing comments.\nWard Nye: Thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence. We believe that [triumbrent] inevitably leads to superior results, and we're confident on Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhance shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2022 results in the late fall. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenny, and welcome to Martin Marietta. And good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report the record results that Martin Marietta delivered in the second quarter, extending our strong track record of commercial excellence, profitable growth and disciplined execution of our strategic plan. In light of the challenging macroeconomic environment, including the rapid acceleration of key input costs, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus, ability to respond quickly and appropriately to changing dynamics and the resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our impressive results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also closed 2 previously announced downstream divestitures in the quarter. These transactions further enhance our company's margin profile, both near and long term while strengthening Martin Marietta's balance sheet and further improving the durability of our business through cycles. Our first half performance, coupled with these strategic divestitures, provide an even more attractive foundation for accelerated growth in the second half of 2022 and beyond. As highlighted in today's release we achieved a number of significant financial and operating records in the second quarter, a few specific examples include: consolidated total revenues increased 19% to $1.64 billion, consolidated gross profit increased 10% to $425 million, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $478 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.96. Our strong performance was due in large part to the diligent execution of our value over volume commercial strategy following the implementation of our April 1 price increases, widespread product demand across our coast-to-coast footprint and contributions from acquisitions. However, we were not immune to high input cost inflation, and as such, gross margins declined slightly. Notably, our teams are taking actions to mitigate the impacts of this historic inflation by implementing third quarter price increases broadly across products and geographies, which primarily take effect between July 1 and September 1. Additionally, we're advising customers of a fourth quarter price increase in a number of our markets. We believe these commercial initiatives, together with other operational inflation management actions position Martin Marietta well to benefit in the near term from anticipated record second half pricing growth rates. Continued product demand, together with customer preference for material quality and availability, is expected to support an extended favorable pricing environment. We're well positioned to produce quality products, meeting this demand as a result of recent and ongoing capital investments as well as focused operational improvements at our key facilities. It's important to remember that historically, inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials, the benefits of which endure a long after other inflationary pressures abate. While we typically invest in our business for growth, we also review the overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value through either monetizing or exchanging select assets where we may not be the best owners. Consistent with that approach, on April 1, we closed the sale of our Colorado and Central Texas ready-mixed concrete businesses to Suburban Ready Mix and on June 30, we completed the previously announced sale of our Reading cement plant, its related distribution terminals and certain California concrete operations to CalPortland Company. Together, these margin-accretive portfolio refinements enhance the overall durability of our business and provide Martin Marietta with the balance sheet flexibility to increase shareholder value by redeploying proceeds into future aggregates-led acquisitions. We're focused on continuing our organic growth improvements and initiatives while returning capital to shareholders and reducing our net leverage to within our targeted range. Let's now turn to our second quarter operating performance, starting with aggregates. We continue to experience healthy aggregates demand across our 3 primary end markets, with total aggregate shipments, inclusive of acquisitions, increasing over 9% to a second quarter record of 57.8 million tons. Organic aggregate shipments increased 1.8% despite numerous supply chain and logistics issues governing the overall pace of construction activity. Additionally, in key Sunbelt markets, cement shortages negatively impacted our ready-mix concrete customers thereby, constraining aggregate shipments to that segment. Organic aggregates pricing increased 8.8% or 7.5% on a mix-adjusted basis, as our April 1 increase is built upon our first quarter pricing momentum based on high demand and increased costs. The Texas cement market is experiencing robust demand and tight supply. Against that backdrop and combined with our cement team's focused execution on commercial and operational excellence, we delivered record quarterly shipments of 1.1 million tons and pricing growth of 14.7% as our $12 per ton increase went into effect on April 1. The market conditions in Texas, together with ongoing import challenges in Martin Marietta's core cement regions of Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, set the stage for further pricing actions this year, including a second $12 per ton price increase that was effective as of July 1. The outlook for Texas cement remains extremely attractive for the foreseeable future. Shifting to our downstream businesses. Organic ready-mix concrete shipments increased 3.4%, reflecting strong product demand in the Texas Triangle, partially offset by the previously mentioned cement tightness. Organic pricing grew a robust 17%, reflecting multiple pricing actions, including fuel surcharges, which have passed through raw material and other inflationary cost pressures. Organic asphalt shipments were effectively flat as strong demand in Denver was offset by a later-than-usual start to the construction season in Minneapolis, while organic pricing improved 17%, following the increase in raw materials costs, principally bitumen. Including contributions from our acquired operations in California and Arizona, asphalt shipments increased 40%. Despite the dynamic macroeconomic operating environment and the impact on housing starts, inflation and interest rates, Martin Marietta continued to experience strong second quarter product demand across our geographic footprint. As we entered the third quarter, customer backlogs are firmly ahead of prior year levels with logistics challenges serving as the primary governor to the cadence of product shipments. As we examine each of the company's 3 primary end users, the combined outlook for continued aggregates demand is attractive as robust infrastructure funding and secular nonresidential demand trends are expected to more than offset any potential affordability-driven air pocket in today's historically underbuilt residential segment. With that backdrop, let's now turn to an end-use overview, starting with infrastructure. We're on the cusp of increased levels of infrastructure investment not seen in the United States since the introduction of the interstate highway system in 1956 as already healthy state Department of Transportation budgets receive incremental federal funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, allocations for the 2023 fiscal year, most of which began on July 1. As a result, we expect aggregates demand benefits will begin to accrue later this calendar year with a more pronounced expansion in 2023. Importantly, this increased investment in public works provides a base level of stable demand for our products for years to come. Similar to infrastructure, non-residential construction in Martin Marietta markets should continue to be an area of strength as pandemic impacted sectors, including like commercial, retail, hospitality and energy recover from their pandemic troughs and supply chain disruptions, lead businesses to establish manufacturing facilities closer to in demand. We've seen a notable acceleration and announcements of large aggregates intensive domestic manufacturing facilities. Some examples of these projects in our markets include: the Samsung semiconductor facility in Austin, the Stellantis Samsung joint venture lithium-ion battery plant near Indianapolis, the Taiwan Semiconductor campus near Phoenix and the Vinfast electric vehicle site near Raleigh-Durham. Relative to pandemic accelerated growth sectors, warehouses and data centers are currently experiencing different impacts, starting with warehouses, consistent with Amazon's public announcement in April. We expect a moderation in their rapid square footage growth rate. However, we're continuing to shift to their end process projects. Importantly, though, we're experiencing an uptick in warehouse and cold storage construction from businesses other than Amazon as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and grocers adapt to a secular shift and consumers' preference for delivered goods. Additionally, data center demand remains robust, including meta data center projects in Kansas City and Atlanta, which were well positioned to serve from our nearby locations. With respect to the residential end use, location is always the essential factor. We've been purposeful and intentional in positioning our business in geographies where home prices are comparatively affordable and residential demand is far greater than supply due to a decade of underbuilding amid significant population inflows. As such, we expect the current housing slowdown to be: one, moderate in our key metropolitan areas as home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium; and two, constructive for continued single-family community development in more affordable suburban areas.  As shown in our supplemental information slides, it's important to be mindful that even with June slowdown in housing, single-family housing starts remain at approximately $1 million on a seasonally adjusted basis, which, in our view, is a healthy level and supportive of continued aggregates demand to both the direct residential sector as well as the ancillary construction that suburban community development requires. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and provide some context for our updated full year guidance. Jim? Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We're well positioned to capitalize on the strong product demand trends across our coast-to-coast geographic footprint as increased infrastructure investment, along with the recovery in light nonresidential construction, large-scale energy projects and domestic manufacturing is expected to largely insulate product shipments from any near-term affordability driven headwinds in residential end markets. Our team remains committed to the health and safety of our community, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Trey, thank you for the question. Look, you're seeing something you haven't seen in your career and I am, too. And that is the way pricing is working is really just extraordinary. And party goes back to some of the commentary we discussed at the end of Q1, and that was we're seeing this in many respects as the best single commercial pricing environment that I think we've seen in a generation or 2. If we look at what's happened so far, and I think it does give you a nice build in the supplemental slides from Slide 4. We've seen very nice aggregates and cement pricing through Q2. We've seen broad midyear increases that have gone in. They've been implemented as of July 1. What we're seeing in July on those price increases looks very attractive. So to your point, what gives us confidence in this outlook? It's really seeing what we've seen so far in July, even building on what we've seen strongly throughout the year so far. What we anticipate is aggregates pricing here in the second half is going to be an exit rate that's really going to be at about 14.5%. I mean that's a really attractive number. We think cement can be -- it's something that feels more like 21.5%. So as we think about those exit rates, to your point, this year going into next year, it gives me 2 very base impressions: number one, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're going to have a record year; number two, as we go into next year, we're going to have what we anticipate to be another very attractive year. And the other thing that I think is worth noting, Trey, is a lot of what's driving pricing right now is clearly what's happening with energy. But as you know, having watched this space for a long time, energy tends to subside at some point. At the same time, heavy side upstream material pricing usually does not. So again, I think from an inflation management perspective, the team has done an extraordinary job, and I really appreciate your comments. No, happy to Stanley. Thank you for the question. I think several things are properly relevant. Number one, are contractors continuing to hire to the extent that they can? Yes. So is that a modest constraint that we see getting better? Sure. Is trucking still in some markets a constraint because of the availability of drivers? Absolutely. I think if you look at the overall public numbers from the railroads as well, it's getting better, but it hasn't been as fluid, I think, as they would have hoped. Here's something else though, that I think is really worth noting, and that is, in a lot of markets, cement is on allocation. So think about what that means as products roll through the process. If ready-mix producers can't get cement later in the week, the fact is they're not going to put down ready-mix concrete, which means they're not going to bring in aggregates. So the fact is that a really tight cement market in some markets can also have a bit of a governor on what overall aggregates growth looks like. So as we're looking at the back half of the year, those are some of the things that we've taken into account as we think about volumes. Now to your point, if we also try to consider what our customers' backlogs look like the customer backlogs are really quite good, and we're pretty heartened by that. What we're seeing right now is, overall in aggregates, the backlogs are about 9% ahead of where they were at prior year levels. So those are pretty heady numbers. What I like in particular is some of the wear on that. So if we look in the East division, which, as you know, is one of our very profitable divisions, that's up about 13% over where it was prior year. But here's one that's really notable, and that is in the Central division, now some of this is impacted by our acquisition of Tiller last year, but Central divisions up about 30%. And then even as we look at West Group, and again, you've heard the numbers on what's happening in the West, particularly in Texas, for example, in cement, that markets is sold out. We're basically seeing backlogs in that market broadly where they were prior year. And even in Southwest ready mix, we're seeing, again, backlog is very consistent, but bidding is remaining very strong. throughout the markets that are so core to us in DFW, Austin and San Antonio. So I hope that's responsive to your question on what we see on volumes and some of the why. But importantly, what we see on customer backlog and in summary, and what gives us that nice confidence as we look out. Kevin, look, that's actually a great question and really nails much of what the story has been this year. So here's the quick take on that question. If we look at the full year, and take a look not just at the organic business, but the all-in business that we have, and we try to compare this year to last year relative to energy costs, the headline number is, we're going to have about $200 million of energy cost this year that we didn't have last year. So what I think is so important to do is to contextualize what I think has been superb performance by our team this year. We've got a $200 million headwind and we're talking about making $1.7 billion. So let's keep that in mind. Now to your point, I'm not going to prognosticate on when we're going to see energy start to subside. But if past is prologue, we're going to see that subside over time. To the other part of your question, we typically do not see average selling prices in these substream products, primarily, I'm saying aggregates and in cement, subside the way that we think we're going to see energy come down. So again, if we're taking that $200 million headwind and then back away and say, but ballpark, half of that ish is going to be what's happening in diesel fuel. Because, again, if we just take a look overall at what we're utilizing in diesel, we're going to be somewhere between 54 million and 55 million gallons of diesel fuel usage during the course of the year. So I think that at least sets the table on what the headline number is, how much of it's diesel. Obviously, there are going to be components of it that are natural gas and electricity. And by the way, every one of those is up pretty considerably from where they were in Q1 and our forecast takes that into account going forward. So I hope that helps. Brian, thank you for the question. Primarily, we're managing inflation in 2 different ways. I mean, you've seen what we're doing commercially to help manage inflation. The other thing that we're doing is making sure that we continue to strive for operational excellence to lower cost per ton in as many other ways as we possibly can. And we feel like the combination of those 2 things will likely lead to margin expansion, particularly beginning as we look at Q4 this year and into next year. As we look at the way DOTs are reacting, I think it's important to state, we're not seeing DOTs cancel any projects. I think on some occasions, we're seeing DOTs postponed some projects. And I think this is the notion. They're seeing very high, in particular, bitumen or liquid asphalt pricing. I think their hope is that they will see that pull back to some degree. I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is if you're looking at DOT pricing on projects that may have been done, what do we want to say, 6, 7, 8, 9 months ago, the fact is the cost input on projects today is so fundamentally different for contractors than it was during that time frame. It's not unusual for contractors to be coming in with numbers that are ahead of engineers' estimates. When that happens, that oftentimes dictates a rebidding anyway. So I think what we're seeing to a varying degree is in DOTs are being proactive, looking at numbers again, seeing what's realistic and then putting that out. Because I think part of what's important to keep in mind, Brian, is in the Martin Marietta states that have seen significant population inflows, legislatures and governors want to see this work go. So the fact is we're not seeing things canceled. We've seen in some places, things postponed. We think that actually plays out very nicely for us because as you see, we're more focused on value over volume anyway. And we think this actually plays out comfortably as we roll into '23 and the years after. So Brian, I hope that helps, too. Jerry, thank you so much. And what I'll say is we will obviously give you much more color into '23 as we get closer to the end of this year. And obviously, when we get into February next year, we'll be very granular on it. I think, as we said, we certainly anticipate exiting the year at some very attractive exit rates relative to ASPs. We think we've got a -- we know we have a good handle on our cost profile. What I'll do is I'll turn to Jim to ask him to respond very specifically to some of your margin questions. So Jim? Thank you for the question. I'm going to answer the last part of it first, and that is typically the lag is about the same. In other words, if housing slows in markets, it would take several months, 6, 9, in some places, 12 for commercial to slow. Our view is we're really not seeing that. I mean, if we're looking at nonres in our markets, part of what we try to call out and you see it and the CEO commentary, among others. I outlined very specifically 5 different nonres projects that are relatively new, except for the 1 energy sector project that was called out that we see evolving. And again, those were Campo Commerce in South Carolina, Meta Data Center in Kansas City, the Samsung projects in Austin and the High Point Logistics Park in Aurora, Colorado. So what we're seeing in that dimension is actually quite attractive. There are 2 other things that I think are worth keeping in mind: number one, we're seeing the activity relative to chips that you saw come out of a relatively bipartisan vote in the Senate yesterday. If the house moves forward with that, that will clearly dictate more manufacturing here in the United States. I think much of that will likely occur in coastal areas where we tend to have a very attractive footprint. The other piece of it that I think is likely to be even more attractive, and this is more on heavy size than the line side is what we anticipate happening with energy. And I think energy can frankly be twofold: number one, we've long talked about those large LNG project pipeline projects that we see in South Texas and Louisiana. It's worth noting, as we've looked at those in the past, we've talked about the potential if those projects come to bear of around 13.5 million tons of aggregates that are tied to those different jobs and about 770,000 cubic yards of ready-mix. The updated numbers on those, to give you a sense of it, aggregates has gone from 13.5 million requirements to what looks like now it's closer to 19 million tons of requirements. The cubic yardage of ready-mix has gone from 770,000 to now 920,000. So again, I think nonres moves around a little bit. That's on energy in South Texas. Again, if some of these bills go through, and frankly, from a Martin Marietta perspective, if we see more wind energy in places like the Midwest, keep in mind, those tend to be very aggregates intensive jobs as well. So if we're looking at cold storage, if we're looking at warehousing, if we're looking at energy, if we're looking at degrees of more manufacturing in the United States, and we continue to have the population trends that we're seeing in Martin Marietta states of moment, meaning Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, et cetera. We think, number one, residential is going to stay very resilient for us. We think the white nonres that follows that is going to be good. And we think these components of heavy nonres can actually be very attractive, and there are also going to be very aggregates intensive. Keith, thank you for the question. And look, energy has been all over the place you would imagine. And obviously, we're just looking broadly at energy. Obviously, we said we got a $200 million headwind this year. We said about half of that is really going to be attributable to diesel fuel. If we're looking at really how much we move things around on natural gas since the last time we looked to that. I'm going to ask Jim to come back and speak specifically to that because he can give you a sense of the volatility on that. Relative to natural gas, there's really not a lot of other hedging or otherwise that goes on in that. So it is relatively real time. But Jim, over to you. And Keith, just to put 1 more bit of data here. If we're looking at Q2 last year to Q2 this year and the increase on a percentage basis in nat gas, it's up about 66%. If we're looking at it more sequentially on where it was in Q1 versus where it was in Q2, up about 10%. So at least you're seeing a pullback in those percentage increases. George, thank you first for the question. I appreciate that very much. I guess several things that I would say. If you look at overall of what we've done relative to decarbonization, we've been looking at alternative fuels. We've been looking at that at both of our facilities, for example, if we look at the way that we're operating our plant in Midlothian, which is in North Texas, we're using tardive fuels for a good bit of that process right now. Overall, what's going to have to happen to really see significant decarbonization is we're going to have to see products and plans that can be used very broadly at a commercial level. I think if we actually look at the decarbonization of our plants and we go apples-to-apples, not apples to oranges relative to the performance that our plants have in the United States relative to most of the performance that we see from a carbon footprint perspective globally. I actually don't think we're behind on that. I think if you look at the sustainability report that we published in April, in which we went to great pains to outline what the different blending mechanisms can be and really how those scores are kept. I think you'll see that we're actually in a very, very good place. The other thing that's worth noting is if we go back in time and take a look at the capital that has gone into that strategic cement footprint that we have in Texas since 2014, we put about $1 billion worth of CapEx into that business. So what I think is fair to say is we've got a very attractive cement business in Texas. That is what we've been designed toward building as you'll see the margins in that business look and feel like the margins do in our aggregates business. That was part of our plan. And at least going forward, our ability to invest in that facility to utilize PLC cement, which Jim referenced in his prepared remarks, we think actually has us in a very attractive place. And we think we're going to be in a position to move as we need to: one, as a business; and two, is a very good community steward going forward to make sure that we can have the types of returns in that business that our shareholders expect and at the same time, make sure that we're the neighbor that people want us to be. Phil, thanks for the question. Good to hear your voice. And the short answer is we've actually got pretty good line of sight on the nonres. These tend to be particularly on these larger manufacturing type facilities, big jobs as a consequence of the size of the jobs. The owners are out, they are talking to generals and suppliers as well. Part of what we're seeing now is people are thinking about notices to proceed. They're giving us dates on when they think that's going to occur, that's occurring on a number of these large LNG project pipelines. It's also occurring on a number of those jobs that we outlined in the commentary that was published with our release today. I mean, part of what's striking to me is we look at some of these semiconductor facilities or others. I mean, these are enormous facilities, and we spoke not this past February, but the February before at Investor Day, how much size actually dictates more than dollars the aggregates intensity on these projects? So I think your point is a really good one and that is not all markets are going to be treated equally as we go through whatever the next several months maybe. And again, if we're simply looking at nonres and frankly, if we go through it on a stop light basis and go red, green, yellow, we're seeing a lot of green on nonres as we go through our top 6 states. And frankly, I'll tell you as I look at it today from a non-res perspective, they're all green right now. Ask that question again, you said between the infrastructure and say it again. I didn't hear it, Phil. Look, we'll obviously come out and give very detailed guidance on that at some point. But here's what I would say, Phil. Look, this infrastructure bill is up considerably. The states in which we operate are in a very good budget perspective. You've probably seen what I have, and that is states like North Carolina that are looking forward ahead are now in the latest budget that's been approved saying we're going to take a certain percentage of sales taxes and putting that to infrastructure. Obviously, if we're looking at population trends in our key states, the trends themselves have been quite attractive. I think what people are looking for, Phil, at the end of the day, is in a volatile time, what looks safe. And I think one of the things that this management team believes is that we have built a very durable business, a business that has the capacity and enough market to outperform and ability that as we go through cycles, we'll continue to outperform. And it's not just that we have a durable business. We built a durable business in markets that we think will outperform. So obviously, we'll give you more, but I'm trying to give you some data around what gives us such confidence going into next year, and we'll give you more detail as we get closer. But we're not seeing anything in '23. As we look at it broadly, that scares us right now. David, that's a great question. And I think you just saw it this quarter. I mean, I think it constrains it. I think it makes it modestly tighter. I don't think it does horribly shocking things to it. Because what happens, David, is different states are going to react very differently to a cement shortage. So here's a good way to think of it. Obviously, Texas is the big cement-producing state. It has a number of facilities there. We're the largest cement producer in Texas. If we come here to our backyard in North Carolina, there's not a cement plant to be found in the entire state because it's largely a granite state. And where we do have limestone that can meet the criteria that you would need with high calcium carbonate, it's going to be in the eastern part of the state, and it's going to be so difficult to access that you don't have a meaningful cement plan in the state. At the same time, we don't see concrete acting remarkably different here that is in places like Texas today. So again, David, I would call it more on the margin, it's going to be something that we might talk about and could slow it down to a degree. It's not going to be something that if I'm sitting where you are sitting or frankly, where I'm sitting, that I'm going to have a great degree of concern about in large measure because the work is not going to go away. The work is likely just to be pushed to the side. And one of the things that I think we recognize is in a circumstance in which materials can be tight, again, it's a very attractive commercial environment for us. So I don't think it's going to be horribly meaningful on the volume. It will be modestly. I think it's going to be more meaningful positively on the ASP. Mike, thanks so much for that question. Happy to. So we'll break it really into 2 material buckets. Let's talk first about the Lehigh assets in the West. So we're not seeing anything that we've been surprised by, and that is these assets have substantial earnings growth and ASP potential that's frankly in the process of being unlocked. So what I would ask you to do is go back and reflect on the way, in many respects, the TXI came into the business and the way that it's performed since then. As you may recall, the single quickest wins that we saw in TXI was really relative to ASP. That's what we're seeing right now in California as well. January 1 price increases on aggregates were up double digit. July 1 midyear increases in large measure, $2 per ton across much of California. And you can also see that we're going through in a very orderly way in looking at the portfolio and making sure that we're keeping what's core to us, where we, in fact, are the best owners. So we're in the process of doing that. I think it's actually gone quite well. So we're not seeing anything in California or Arizona that's been a surprise to us. Frankly, on some days, I'm sure to wish I could get more cement in Arizona, but I will also concede that's a high-class problem in many respects. As we think about the Tiller assets, and as you recall, we bought those just modestly ahead of the Hanson assets last year. Part of what we really like about that business is very limited CapEx requirements in that business. So part of what we're seeing there, these assets are going to be some of the best in portfolio from a cash flow perspective. And we think that's likely to be the case for years to come. The other thing that's been attractive to us, and it's really helped us come back and make sure that we have the investment there that's going to be really attractive for us is Tiller had a good bit of reclaimed land that was available for sale of the transaction. And we've been in the process of monetizing that, frankly, faster than we would have thought at higher valuations than we would have thought. And basically, we're able to take a net purchase price reduction as we go through that. So as we're looking at a very nice operating business in Tiller, it's performing well. Obviously, it's a business that's largely in Minnesota. So as people saw this past year, don't expect much of that in January, February and March because, well, it's cold in Minnesota in January and February and March. But the business is doing quite well. Hansen is doing very predictably, and we feel very good about where that business will go. We've got a very capable management team that's overseeing it, and we continue to be excited about now what is a very meaningful coast-to-coast aggregates led footprint. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence. We believe that [triumbrent] inevitably leads to superior results, and we're confident on Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhance shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2022 results in the late fall. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. As noted in our earnings release, for our continuing operations, the Building Materials business posted an all-time record this quarter, with products and services revenues of $1.45 billion, an 18.3% increase over last year and a second quarter product gross profit record of $401 million, an increase of 12.3%. All-time [record] aggregates gross profit of $309 million improved 13.2% relative to the prior year's quarter. Product gross margin declined 170 basis points to 32.3% as robust pricing growth was not quite enough to offset the inflationary impacts of higher energy, internal freight, contract services and supplies expenses. Cement continues to deliver exceptional top and bottom-line results. Execution of a disciplined commercial strategy drove a gross margin expansion of 140 basis points to 32.4% despite sizable energy cost headwinds and as well as unplanned kiln outages at both the Midlothian and Hunter plants. Domestic production capacity constraints are exacerbating and otherwise already sold-out Texas market, contributing to extremely tight supply and resulting in a marketplace that is on allocation. Importantly, we are taking steps to increase cement production capacity in Texas. Those efforts resulted in setting an all-time quarterly record for cement shipments. In the short run, continued conversion of Portland-limestone cement, or PLC, is creating incremental capacity for us. We expect between 25% and 30% of our historical Type 1 and Type 2 ship volumes to be converted to plc in the second half of this year. Many of you are aware, but it bears repeating that PLC is an innovative product that contains between 5% and 15% limestones and performs as well as standard cement, but with a lower carbon intensity. In the medium term, we expect to have our new Midlothian finish mill completed in late 2023, early 2024. This will provide 450,000 tons of much net incremental capacity to the Texas marketplace. As a reminder, our second quarter ready-mix concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1 and include the acquired Arizona operations, impacting the comparability to the prior year quarter. On an as-reported basis, ready-mix concrete revenues were down 15.8% as lower shipments due to the divestiture were partially offset by higher ASP. Gross profit declined $5 million to $14 million, and gross margin declined 80 basis points to 6.3% due to higher raw material and diesel costs. Our asphalt and paving results include the operations acquired on the West Coast, impacting comparability to the prior quarter. On an as-reported basis, stable demand, improved pricing and acquisition contributions were not enough to offset the rapid increase in liquid asphalt raw material costs in the second quarter. As a result, gross profit declined $2 million to $26 million and gross profit margins declined 880 basis points. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from strong global demand for batteries as one of its chemicals line of products is used in cobalt extraction. This business generated record quarterly product revenues of $75 million, a 7% increase. However, due to the second quarter's rapid escalation in energy costs, gross margins contracted to a still impressive 34.6%. Higher energy costs are common then this quarter. However, we do not believe they will remain permanently elevated. If diesel fuel costs return to 2021 levels when West Texas intermediate crude sold for an average of $68 per barrel, our aggregates gross margin would expand by approximately 200 basis points. To be clear, we are forecasting diesel prices to remain flat with current levels for the rest of the year. However, we did want to provide context for the impact on margins when diesel costs ultimately subside. It is important to note that as indicated in our supplemental information slides, hopefully half of our aggregate pipeline costs have not increased at rates above historical trends. For example, personnel, depreciation and other expenses combined have remained generally in line with historical levels. While interest expense does not impact production costs, it does impact earnings. So I will briefly touch on that given the rapid rise in interest rates this year. In short, our borrowing costs are 100% fixed, eliminating direct exposure to rising interest rates. On a consolidated basis, other operating income net included $152 million of gain on the divestiture of the Colorado and Central Texas ready-mixed concrete operations. During the first half of the year, we returned $127 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We continue to anticipate a return to our target net leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x by year-end. Excluding the $152 million divestiture gain, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7x as of June 30. We remain diligent in the steadfast execution of our store priorities, focusing on allocating capital in a responsible, diligent and comprehensive manner to high-return initiatives that create value for shareholders. We plan to use the proceeds from our recently completed cement and concrete divestitures to further our long-standing capital allocation priorities. These include: prudently investing in value-enhancing aggregates-led acquisitions and organic growth initiatives as well as returning capital to shareholders, all within the framework of maintaining a durable and resilient balance sheet. And as detailed in today's release, we have updated our full year 2020 guidance to reflect our first half results, expected second half pricing cadence as well as the overall macroeconomic operating environment as we anticipate continued inflationary pressure and volume constraints driven by continued supply chain and logistics challenges. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to range $1.670 billion to $1.750 billion. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward. Yes. So yes, you're right, Jerry. We're looking at Q4 at a consolidated level being more profitable than prior year Q4. And that also applies, of course, to the aggregates business, which is the main business. Aggregates and cement, Q4 should continue the upward trajectory that we've seen, we expect to see. And at that point, we think they're outpacing cost inflation. Now again, that assumes we don't see a resumption of the rapid increases that we saw in the second quarter. We don't expect that to happen. So we think what we're forecasting will come to pass. And again, the ASP growth rate that we've projected will more than offset the cost growth that we're expecting as well. So by and large, yes, getting better each quarter here and out in Q4, in particular, will be meaningfully better than the prior Q4. Yes. So of the headwind -- the $200 million headwind this year versus last year, $100 million in diesels, it's worth mentioning $50 million is natural gas. So it's meaningful to our operations. To answer your question, it is the most volatile of the energy costs we've got right now. And I think our ability to react to it is similar to our diesel approach, we'll have to react to it in the form of higher pricing and there's a bit of a lag to that typically. It can be depending on the business anywhere from 3 to 6 months before we get that, that pricing reflected in the as we manage against those higher costs. So we're on it. We're kind of paying attention to it. It remains elevated volatility. So that's just a thing we're keeping an eye on."

A Q&A session will follow the company prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Suzanne, you may begin.\nSuzanne Osberg: Good morning. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta 's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me today are C. Howard Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities Laws in connection with future events, future operating results for financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  We undertake no obligation except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings which are available on both our own and the Securities Exchange Commission's website. We've made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, Q1 2022 Supplemental Information that summarizes our financial results in trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations.  In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconcile to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the Supplemental Information, as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward and I will be in today's earnings call with a discussion of our first-quarter operating performance, portfolio optimization announcements, our updated full-year guidance, and market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I'll now turn the call over to Ward.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We are excited about Martin Marietta's opportunities for operational, safety and financial success in 2022 and beyond. We're off to a predictable start this year. And our company's prospects for attractive growth and value creation are outstanding. Public and private construction activity are set to expand concurrently for the first time since this industry's most recent shipment peak in 2005, supporting multi-year demand and pricing acceleration for our products.  Beyond the benefits of these notable industry dynamics and underlying market fundamentals. We're confident that continued disciplined execution of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR. Will allow for responsible and sustainable growth of our coast-to-coast footprint. As highlighted in today's release, we once again exceeded world-class safety metrics company-wide. That's an important distinction as this performance includes operations that are relatively new to Martin Marietta guardian angel culture.  We also achieved a new first-quarter record for consolidated total revenues, which increased 25% pricing gains ahead of more broadly planned April increases. Organic upstream shipment growth in 2021 acquisitions all helped drive this top-line improvement. Cost inflation, however, outpaced revenue growth, resulting in reduced first-quarter profitability and margins versus the prior-year quarter. This was expected. In fact, our guidance provided in February weighted increased profit contributions to the second half of 2022 versus historical patterns. The reasons we anticipated and articulated regarding the shift we're two-fold.  First, our annual price increases, which are some of the largest and Martin Marietta's recent history mostly become effective on April 1st, the benefit from which builds throughout the year. Second, our costs, including energy headwinds, were anticipated to be more pronounced earlier in the year since comparable periods in the previous year experienced relatively benign inflation. What was unexpected though, was the rapid escalation and energy prices and other cost inflation in recent months. Nonetheless, beyond achieved and yet to be realized annual price increases, we're confident that disciplined execution of our commercial and operational excellence initiatives will more than offset these inflationary headlines.  It's important to remember that historically, inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials, the benefits of which endure long after inflationary pressures moderate. Our teams are actively advising customers of mid-year pricing actions, which we anticipate will be widely accepted and more aggressive in scope and magnitude than we were initially considering a few months ago. Longer-term, Martin Marietta is well-positioned to execute on our value over volume pricing strategy and benefit from what is expected to be an increasingly more favorable and extended pricing cycle.  Confidence in our near- and long-term outlook is further underpinned by the disciplined execution of our SOAR 2025 priorities. During the quarter, we continue to optimize and enhance our aggregate SLED portfolio. We completed the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas ready-mix concrete businesses to the nation's largest privately-owned concrete producer on April 1. We also recently entered into an agreement to sell our Redding cement plant, related cement distribution terminals, and 14 ready-mix concrete plants in California to CalPortland Company. We expect to complete this transaction in the second half of 2022.  Collectively, these portfolio optimization actions both strengthened the durability of our business through economic cycles and enhance our margin profile. We intend to deploy the proceeds from these sales to advance our long-standing capital allocation priorities, facilitating higher-return, external, and organic growth investments to further enhance shareholder value. Before discussing our updated for your guidance, let's level set first-quarter results relative to the rest of 2022. While profits were lower than last year's for the reasons just discussed, the key takeaway is that the first quarter does not represent the beginning of a price cost margin compression trend.  Rather, we believe it's the end of the margin compression dynamic for the company, the scale, frequency, and efficacy of our price increases provide us the confidence to forecast full-year margins for 2022 exceeding those of 2021. In short, we believe better than expected aggregates pricing realization and contributions from our newly acquired West Coast operations will offset the divested earnings and expected inflationary headwinds.  As a result, we've reiterated our full-year adjusted EBITDA midpoint guidance of $1.75 billion. As pricing momentum continues to build during the spring construction season, we anticipate that further pricing upside is probable. Accordingly, we'll revisit our full-year guidance after the second quarter. Turning now to first-quarter operating performance for our upstream and downstream businesses, organic aggregate shipments increased to 2.5%, reflecting growing public and private demand at the onset of the construction season. Encouragingly, Infrastructure shipments increased 6%, the largest percentage increase we've seen in several years. Acquired operations contributed an additional 4 million tons. Underpinned by our value over volume strategy, organic aggregates pricing increased 6.5% or 4.6% on a mix adjusted basis and reflected improving long haul shipments from higher-priced distribution yards. All divisions contributed to this pricing growth. As the largest cement producer in Texas, we continue to benefit from tight supply and robust product demand.  Shipments exceeded 1 million tons and increased 10% setting a new first-quarter record. Cement pricing grew 12% from multiple actions taken in 2021 and the resurgence and demand for higher-priced specialty products. With a $12 per ton increase effective April 1 and our recently announced second round increase of an additional $12 per ton effective July 1, the Texas cement pricing outlook is extremely attractive. Organic ready-mix concrete shipments remained relatively flat despite the completion of several large and typically higher priced, portable projects.  Organic concrete pricing grew 8% following off cycle price increases and the implementation of fuel surcharges. Organic asphalt shipments decreased 3% as significant snowfall in January and February hindered Colorado construction activity. Organic asphalt pricing improved 6%. Looking beyond the first quarter, we remain confident that attractive market fundamentals and strong demand across our three primary end-use markets will drive aggregates-intensive growth and favorable pricing trends for Martin Marietta for the foreseeable future.  Enhanced infrastructure investments should drive aggregate shipments to this end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 40% of total shipments. For reference aggregates to the infrastructure market accounted for 32% of first-quarter organic shipments. Department of Transportation budgets for our top states continue to be well funded through traditional revenue sources, as well as $10 billion dollars of COVID relief aid pushing estimated lettings nicely above prior levels.  Increased funding from the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, will further enhance the current strength of our state DOT programs, providing DOTs with increased visibility and certainty to advance their multitude of backlog projects. With full IIJA allocation available for 2023 DOT fiscal years, the majority of which began on July 1, we expect benefits to begin accruing in late 2022 and become more pronounced in 2023. Non-residential construction, which drove 36% of Martin Marietta first-quarter aggregate shipments continues to benefit from the paradigm shift in consumer and work preferences and supply chains as evidenced by increased investment in aggregates intensive warehouses, data centers, and reassuring of manufacturing facilities to the United States.  Commercial and retail construction throughout our Sunbelt markets is expected to become more significant demand driver in 2022 as it's typically follows, single-family residential development with a 9-to-12-month lag. By way of example, Charlotte, North Carolina. On an office trends are returning to pre -pandemic levels with more than 2.6 million square feet of office space currently under construction in that area. The residential construction outlook remains strong despite rising interest rates and inflationary pressures, following more than a decade of historically bold new housing construction.  Expectations are that annual single-family housing starts remain in line with early 2000 levels over the next few years. That said the United States has added over 30 million people in the intervening period. Given our company's attractive footprint in destination metropolitan areas, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit disproportionately from new home construction for the foreseeable future.  As a reminder, construction of single-family homes in subdivisions is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction. Given further, community build out of light non-residential and infrastructure. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 26% of our first-quarter organic shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically, our first-quarter financial results and liquidity, Jim.\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward. And good morning, everyone. For our continuing operations. The building materials business posted record product services, revenues of $1.1% billion, a 26% increase from last year's prior quarter. And product gross profit of $137 million. Aggregate\u2019s product gross margin of 14.9% declined 640 basis points. Product shipment and pricing growth was not enough to offset increased costs for diesel, internal freight, other production costs in depreciation, depletion, and amortization. As Ward indicated earlier, our Texas cement business is benefiting from growing demand and tight supply. Cement product gross margin expanded 630 basis points to 20.3% on a relatively favorable comparison. As a reminder, first-quarter 2021 was negatively impacted by production inefficiencies and incremental storm-related costs from the Texas deep-freeze. Partially offsetting this favorability were higher energy and raw materials costs in addition to a nearly $9 million increase in planned maintenance costs. Almost half of this year's planned killed outages, and other maintenance occurred in the first quarter. With that now behind us, we expect favorable comparisons for the next three quarters versus the prior year.  We are pleased to report that both our  and 100 cement plants begin accurately producing Portland-limestone cement or PLC during the quarter. PLC which relies on a limestone substitution of carbon intends clinker was not approved for use by the Texas Department of Transportation until recently. We now expect to ship roughly 425,000 tons of PLC this year. Importantly, in addition to the lower CO_2 emissions, the production of PLC versus traditional type 1 and 2 cement creates an 8% to 10% increase in annual cement production capacity. Importantly, no incremental capital spending is required as we ramp up PLC production.  Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin declined 100 basis points to 7.3% as pricing gains did not fully offset higher costs for our materials, labor, and diesel. As a reminder, first-quarter financial results included the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1. Consistent with seasonal trends in our relevant geographies, minimal asphalt and paving activity occurs in the early months of the year. In fact, our Minnesota -based asphalt facilities, which we acquired in April 2021, were inactive during the first quarter given that market's late spring start to the construction season. In line with our expectations, the asphalt and  business posted a $13 million gross loss for the first quarter. Magnesia Specialties achieved record first-quarter product revenues of $71 million, an 8.5% increase driven by global demand for Magnesia based chemicals products. Despite top-line growth, product gross profit decreased 6% due to higher cost for energy supplies and raw materials, resulting in a 570 basis points decline in product gross margin to 37.8%. We remain focused on the discipline execution of SOAR to responsibly grow our business and deploy capital in a manner that preserves our financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. As Ward indicated earlier, we plan to use the proceeds for recently announced divestitures to advance our long-standing capital allocation priorities, which are focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic investments in returning cash to shareholders through both a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and our share repurchase program while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. We continue to expect full-year capital spending of $525 million to $550 million as we prioritize high-return capital projects, focus on growing sales, and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion.  During the quarter, we returned $89 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share buybacks, while we repurchased nearly 131,000 shares of common stock at average price of $383 per share, we continue to anticipate a return to our target leverage ratio of 2-2.5 times by the end of the year. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times as of March 31st. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward.\nC. Howard Nye: Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We're well-positioned to capitalize on Infrastructure tailwinds, and strong private demand across our differentiated coast-to-coast geographic footprint. Looking ahead, we expect this increasing demand environment to drive multiyear shipment growth and attractive pricing for our products. Our team remains committed to employee health and safety.  Commercial and operational excellence. Sustainable business practices, and the execution of our store of 2020 -- 25 initiatives as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates lead public company. If the Operator will now provide the required instructions, will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. . In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can get to everyone in the queue. Our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens, your line is open.\nTrey Grooms: Hey good morning. Morning Ward, Jim and Suzanne.\nC. Howard Nye: That's right.\nTrey Grooms: So, Ward, you mentioned earlier having a predictable start to the year thus far. If you could go into a little more detail on what you meant there and then with that, what gives you the confidence to raise the guidance at this point in the year, notwithstanding divestitures, maybe if you could go into more color on how higher pricing and then the performance of recently acquired operations are playing into this confidence.\nC. Howard Nye: I'm happy to, Trey, to answer the question. I guess a couple of things. First, we are actually comfortably ahead of plan right now. So that's part of what we think is not yet predictable about us because where we're sitting, where we're not in a whole, we're actually ahead of where we thought we would be. As you know, the first quarter is never a big quarter for volumes, so small percentages can -- or small numbers can make for big percentage in the first quarter.  Part of what I think from my perspective was predictable is we didn't have tiller last year in the first quarter. Obviously, that's a Minnesota base business and you're not going to put down a lot of asphalt in Minnesota in January, February, and March. The other thing that support, and Jim outlined it in his commentary as well, we actually accelerated some of the maintenance on the kilns in Texas this year. So, we're about halfway through with dollars, or more than halfway through with dollars that we're going to have on that. So, I think both those are important. Obviously, we did see degrees of inflation. But the other thing that we've seen, and I think this is to your point, Trey, on what gives us confidence to actually take our guidance up a bit, is what we're seeing commercially relative to pricing. We -- obviously, you're seeing price increases go in in April. We would not take up the guidance unless we were seeing what was happening in April and had a high degree of confidence in that. The other thing, Trey, that I think is different about right now, but in some respects, predictable is what we're seeing relative to mid-year price increases as well. So, number 1, the April price increases have come into where that we thought.  Number 2, we're looking at much more widespread mid-year price increases across our footprint than we've seen in a while. As you recall, last year when we did that, we talked about targeted mid-year price increases. This year we're talking about widespread. In other words, if we're not going to have a mid-year, that's going to be the exception this year. And we're also seeing that in scope from a dollar a ton the $5 dollar a ton depending on market, depending on product, etc. Part of what we're seeing, and this is a bit of a fundamental shift, customers are considerably more concerned today about getting product than they are relative to price.  So again, an attractive place for us to be if we're talking about timing of mid years. It's probably they're going to come in somewhere between July 1, in most markets as late as September 1, and others. But I mean, to give you a sense of it, this goes at least back to a part of your question relative to the acquired operations. If we're looking to price increases that we're looking at in California right now, we're looking at $2 a ton that's going to be effective mid-year July 1.  And again, that represents a double-digit percentage increase versus the January 1 ASP. So, you're seeing that nice building effect in that market. Even if we go to a heritage market and look at Central Texas, what we're talking to customers about very candidly there is a 10% increase in July 1 across-the-board at locations and on products. Still as we're looking at where we sit relative to the new acquisitions, if we're looking at the investments that we've made, the  business here at first quarter.  And we're looking at the overall price increases and we're looking at the fact that despite the inflation that we saw in Q1, we're comfortably ahead of plan, that gives you a sense of it was predictable about about it, but hopefully it gives you a sense of where we are in areas that gives us the confidence to take the guidance up.\nTrey Grooms: Yeah. That all makes sense to me and very encouraging, especially on the pricing front. Thanks for the color, Ward, I'll pass it on.\nC. Howard Nye: Thanks Trey. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research, your line is open.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. I'd like to focus a little bit more on the outlook from a customer perspective. What are your backlog looking like from each of the main end markets, res non-res in public? And touching on tight availability, it's pretty much at full utilization and taxes and still running short on products like TREXIMET, which has effectively stopped that. You can also see how we're going to manage, there's demand and aggregate demand in light of what you have a backlog. Thank you.\nC. Howard Nye: Kathryn, to answer the question, I guess several things. One, if we just look at customer backlog, and that's important to think about, the best way we speak to it, if we're looking at aggregates, then it gets up about 11% year-over-year. So again, a very attractive number. If we're looking at cement to your point, it's basically sold out. If we're looking at Magnesia Specialties, chemicals has a record backlog right now. The customer backlogs look very, very attractive to us now.  Equally, if we look at downstream or the different end uses, obviously, we looked at Texas, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, those are our leading states. But here's the high-class dilemma that we have. We're looking at FY22 loadings in Texas, the TxDOT up $10 billion as the highest in five years. If you look at Colorado DOT, as you recall, Kathryn, they passed a 10-year infrastructure bill with $5.3 billion tied up in that. If we're looking at North Carolina, obviously, we're looking to recently passed date by any in budget, it's got a $4.2 billion number for FY22, and it's going up 17 -- where it's up 17% over where it was and it's going to be higher for '23.  This is my way of saying state budgets are very good. Our ability to put the product on the ground to meet the customer's needs is there. So we are not concerned about meeting their needs. What I think is also important, though, is trying to address in my comments around non-res. We're seeing more office building taking place. We're seeing more  taking place. And I think a lot of that is driven by where we have built our business.  And again, you've heard us speak for a while that where you are in this industry matters a great deal. So if we're looking at reshoring, whether it's Toyota come into  us. We now have Vietnamese car manufacturing in North Carolina. We're looking at Samsung north of Austin. These sorts of large, significant commercial projects. But I also think to comment that I gave you in my prepared remarks around office and retail and what we're seeing in markets on Charlotte is important.  But again, trying to close up at least in part, but I'm saying relative to end markets, we continue to see even on the residential side, underdog conditions, and we continue to see very attractive population inflow into our markets. I think some different states, not Martin Marietta states, may see some degree of push back as mortgages move. We're not seeing that and the fact is mortgage rates are up 200 basis points. This versus the prior-year quarter. But as we go back and even look at that, there's no correlation between mortgage rates in single-family starts over the past four years.  So, but I've tried to do in response to your question, just give you a snapshot of. What is it look like at the state level relative to Infrastructure? What we're seeing in non-res book on light and heavy size. And keep in mind, on the heavy side of that, we believe we're going to see increasing LNG activity in south Texas, but quite is already better. And again, residential in our states with very high population inflows looks good. Part of what we've done, Kathryn, as you know, is our capital allocation priorities through cycles has had us in a position that we've added capacity or efficiencies where we needed to and we're in a position to date to meet customer demands and their needs.  At the same time, we recognize we have a very valuable product in the ground and we're going stick with our value over volume philosophy. I think the way all of that is going to coalesce. We will have the product, we meet the customer's needs, and we'll create enduring value for our stakeholders as well. So, Kathryn, I hope that helps.\nKathryn Thompson: Yes, it is. Thank you very much.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.\nStanley Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for taking the question. Ward, could you dig a little bit more into commercial environment that you're dealing with right now? I know you guys have made a lot of investments there. And I'm really just trying to get a sense historically when conditions are good, the larger players tend to outperform, face some of the smaller regional players. I'm curious if you could tie that into the pricing comments, the investments that you made on your discussed on the previous question.\nC. Howard Nye: Stanley, happy to -- good to hear your voice and thank you for the question. Part of what I think is helping us commercially, Stanley, is where we are. And if we go back, the states that I was listing through when we look at the states that are most important to us from a revenue perspective, these were attractive places to be. I mean being in Texas today, being in Colorado, being in California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, where population trends are very powerful, helps us. Having leading positions in those states helps us as well. I think to your point, if we go back and look at the investments we've made, whether it's in North Carolina, or Texas or Colorado or someplace else, as markets get tighter and customers need product, we're clearly going to be in the position to do that.  Part of what we're seeing in some circumstances today is customers have gone up for quotes and the suppliers are unable to meet those requirements at this time, we end up having the ability to come back and at times fill orders that we did not get into first instance because we are very consistent with a value over volume philosophy. And again, we're unapologetic about that, so I think several things. One, it's about the location, Stanley.  Two, it is about the philosophy that we bring to it and three it does go back to the capital allocation priorities that we've had and you've heard us long say that our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. Our next best dollar spent is on internal projects because if we're in the process of making the rocks at Big Rocks were also going to destroy iron. And we want to make sure we keep these sites well-funded, very safe, very efficient, and able to meet market demands, but also flex as demands change. And so far, we've been in a position to do that through a great recession and now through this expansion that were in, so I hope that helps Stanley.\nStanley Elliott: It sure does, thanks so much and best of luck.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned that your guidance is back-half-weighted for aggregates gross margins. But given the magnitude of price increases you're putting through in January and April, how should we think about, I guess, 2Q gross margins and aggregates? Would we still expect that to be down compared to the prior-year period? And maybe just help frame the type of margin expansion in the slope of the recovery in the second half of the year.\nC. Howard Nye: Sure. Let me turn that to Jim and he can walk you through that place.\nJim Nickolas: As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. So, with that in mind, I'll give you the broad-brush strokes. Q2 should be relatively in line with history, but I think the acceleration we're going to see is more pronounced in Q3 and Q4. The reasons are twofold, 1. The compounding cascading, if that's the price increases as obviously a greater effect in the longer you go into the year. But what's also may not be appreciated is the cost base, the inflation of that should moderate as the year goes on, two elements. The oil, the energy inflation, we're assuming for guidance purposes, it remains where it's at.  We don't see a reduction in oil for fuel prices. We're assuming for guidance purposes; they remain at their elevated levels. They don't come down. So, we've built that in. Now that said, last year's corresponding quarters saw increasing costs. So, on a year-over-year basis, we'll see improvement there. The other element is our DD&A is a higher percentage of sales in Q1 than typical because of the acquisitions, but meaningfully that will not increase. That's pretty much a fixed cost.  So Q2, Q3, Q4, that element will be fixed and relatively flat helping the margin expansion in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So, we'll get back, we're going to see the record or near record margins in the back half of the year on the aggregate side for those reasons. Does that answer your question, Garik?\nGarik Shmois: Thank you very much\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer, with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. What I wanted to ask your zero on the mid-year price increases. And my question would be, do you think this will be a structural shift in the industry or do you think this is a one-off due to the high inflation just in 2022.\nC. Howard Nye: Well, look, you know what I've always said. There are very few things in your life that you want that you can buy for $16 a ton except our profit. And to put a spec product on the ground and  for that is I think something is pretty special. Do you think if we go over time and look at the durability of aggregates pricing, one thing that it has shown is that it does have the ability through cycles to continue to move up into the right even at down cycles? I think you've got two things right now, Adam. I think you've got the demand environment that's attractive, that slightly stay attractive. I think you -- layer on top of that demand attractive, that is mighty in some very specific states where we could purposefully build our business.  And I think when you take those things together with inflation, I think you do have something that is going to be more profound for a period of time, certainly than it has been over the last several years in a marketplace that has either been flat or in some instances down in volume. So, it -- from where I'm sitting, Adam, this is the single most attractive commercial moment during my time as CEO of Martin Marietta.  So, in a 12-year period, I haven't seen anything that looks more attractive than this does. And obviously, we'll talk more about '23 as we get closer to it next year. But keeping in mind, we're not going to feel meaningful input from the IIJA in this calendar year. You're going to start to see that next year there's nothing in what we're seeing that doesn't give me a sense that we're going to be in a very attractive aggregates pricing cycle for a period of years.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thank you Ward.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from  with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nPhilip Edwards: Hey, guys, Ward, I guess at this point maybe you have a little more line of sight in terms of the lettings associated with the infrastructure built. So, kind of be helpful, kind of help us think of the cadence of that ramp next year in 2023is it gonna be front-end loaded. In the first year and kind of kicks in pretty meaningfully or is it going a little more gradual nature? And it's been a while since you talked about these LNG projects, certainly with your oil prices are right now. That's a pretty robust backdrop. Help us understand that potential contribution in an overall your ability to kind of supply that demand potentially coming through.\nC. Howard Nye: And I'm happy to full. Thanks for the question. So, look, you go back over time and think about what we put on the ground back in 2005, 2006, we put 205 million tons in the ground back in 2005. We've added, let's call it 40 million - ish tons or more of capacity since then. And as you can see, we were modestly over 200 million tons last year. That's my way of saying, as we see this ramp up, we can meet whatever is going to be required. Number 2, if we think about cadence, so I would say several things. One, please remember there's about $10 billion of COVID relief aid that you're going to see going into the flow this year.  So, I think that's going to be helpful relative to cadence, particularly in the back half of the year. The other thing to keep in mind from last year is there were about $7 billion in new vote or approved initiatives that were passed last November, and about 4.5 of that was in Texas all by itself. So, what I would say to you is here at half 2 this year, we're going to start feeling I would say a bit of IIJA. We're going to feel the considerable amount of the $10 billion. We're going to start to feel portions of that $7 billion as we roll into 2023.  Typically, if we think about the way a highway bill rolls out, in Year 1, you're going to see about 20% to 25% spot. so that's going to be in '23. In Year 2, it tends to be around 40%, so again, that's going to be and '24. And then the balance of it over the following years. So, it's a practical matter if we're really looking at '23, '24, '25, '26, and '27. Those are going to be the IIJA impacted years and I think that's likely to be the type of roll out that we're going to see, and I think remembering that that's going to be augmented by what we've seen in COVID relief funds together with the voter approved initiatives, is the right way to think of it. So hopefully those percentages at least gave you some direction on that as well.\nPhilip Edwards: Anything on the LNG side. Thanks.\nC. Howard Nye: So, I'm sorry about that. Look, what we're seeing on LNG side is several folds. One, as you recall, field there are several large projects in south Texas that combined have about 13.5 million tons of stone that can be required. Right now, we've got generally one of those jobs we've actually seen a change order on that. That's what the Golden Pass job. So, we're actively involved in that. The fact is whether it's Port Arthur, Rio Grande, Chevron Phillips or Schneier a number of those either have final bids that are going in or there and the processes sorting out exactly where they're going to be.  We believe with energy prices at an elevated level, we are likely to see continued activity there. The other thing that we're seeing it again, I'm sure this is not surprised to is we're seeing more wind activity across the United States. We're also seeing more solar activity across the United States. So, energy is likely going to be an area that we will continue to see activity ramp up. Up in competency at least two different wind farms that are looking for product right now. So, I think between LNG, wind farms and solar, all of which are more aggregates and sensitive than you might otherwise believe. That's going to be a pretty attractive end-use for us for a while with a lot of potential times.\nPhilip Edwards: Thank you Ward, real exciting times.\nC. Howard Nye: Thanks, Phillip. Agreed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research, your line is open.\nC. Howard Nye: Michael, we don't hear you. We're not sure if you're on mute or not there.\nMichael Dudas: Yes.\nC. Howard Nye: There you are.\nMichael Dudas: My fat finger got in the way. I'm sorry about that.\nC. Howard Nye: It can happen.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning. Well, I just wonder if like maybe you could share some further observations on what you're seeing from your new acquisitions out in the West Coast. You've gone through some portfolio optimization studies. Are there any other, assuming they are ongoing, but is there any others that are immaterial that we might think about throughout the organization that we might see more in 2022?\nC. Howard Nye: Let's start first with what we've done, what we brought in. And I would say they are all performing at or better than we would've thought. If we look at the Lehigh transaction, California, again, it's ahead of internal expectations after Q1 and by that, I mean on volume, on price, on EBITDA. These assets, we believe have substantial earnings growth and aspects people,  that's in the process of being unlocked. We're talking with our new teammates on the way that we'd like to think about the way running one of those businesses looks like. We talked about the fact that we've successfully put in attractive January 1 increases for all product lines and California.  I think also mentioned that we've got mid-years coming in in that marketplace as well. Again, that's gonna to be around $2 a ton in California. So again, we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. Tiller has been a wonderful acquisition for us as well. Keep in mind in Q1, Tiller is not going to do much because Minnesota just doesn't have that much going on.  But if we look at what we've seen in that business, Number 1, it's a very good business when we bought it. Number 2, we think it's going to be one of the best in class and what Marietta relative to cash flow conversion, we think it's going to be that way for generations to come. It's got very attractive aggregates business, but it also has a very attractive hot mix business and marketplace in which Minnesota has a very aggressive Department of Transportation budget. The other thing that's been important to us there, and it's been a very nice value-add, is some of the excess properties that we've been able to sell that have come out of that business as well. So all-in-all as we're mining there, a lot of it sand and gravel and we're reclaiming property and turning it into very attractive commercial operations or pads going forward, that's been a very attractive business for us.  So, I would tell you that there's been nothing in the major transactions that we did last year that has in any respect been a disappointment. In fact, they've all exceeded what we would have believe. Relative to the optimization, as you would imagine, part of what we've been focused on is what we've long said we are and that it's we are an aggregates led company. At the same time, if we look at the portfolio that we have, I will tell you very candidly, we're very pleased with the portfolio that we have.  So, I wouldn't be looking for enormous changes in that portfolio, but you'll also see with the shifts that we've made and the sale of the ready-mix business in Colorado and Central Texas that we've done, if you look at the initial portfolio breakdown on product line contributions on what it look like before that transact and what it looked like after that transaction, obviously, the aggregates lead portion of it went up fairly notably. And what you'll also see is that we're looking for about a 120 basis points of margin improvement with what we've done relative to the portfolio as well. What you and I know is. Different markets are built differently and some markets you need to be vertically integrated in some markets you don't. Obviously, if we think about the business that we have in Texas, we're the largest aggregates player with the largest  player and the largest ready-mix player. And we think that's an important way to face the market. Equally, if we look at the business that we have in Arizona today, the ready-mix business that we have in Arizona is a very, very attractive ready-mix business.  So, part of what we've done over a period of nearly 30 years now is trying to be very purposeful in where we have built our portfolios, how we built it and what the products are. And we believe with what we've already done and what we had pending right now relative to the sale of Redding in Northern California, the ready-mix in California. And then the preferred transaction that we have with CalPortland relative to . It's a lot of moving parts, but we think it's all value additive moving parts.\nMichaelDudas: Excellent work. Thank you.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you so much. Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with Truist. Your line is open.\nKeith Hughes: Thanks, Nick, question on PLC could you describe earlier a couple of things on that, do that sell at a higher sales price of the customer than just traditional cement and you have a feel for how big a business could be, how well is it accepted in the specific the Texas markets?\nC. Howard Nye: Look, thanks for the question on that. So, a couple of things. 1. It doesn't sell for anything that's markedly higher. Part of what is happening with it, Keith, is different departments of transportation have gone about the process of either approving it or not approving it on different timelines. So, it -- frankly, it's now allowed by TxDOT. The short answer is it performs very similar to type one and type two cement, it certainly helps us, Jim outlined with incremental capacity.  It does lower raw material costs and it puts you in a position that you can use less carbon intensive clinker over time as well, so they are just a series of components to it that from a cost input perspective, from an environmental perspective, and the capacity perspective that end up being actually very attractive. And as you know, Keith, we're cement producer in Texas and cement is very tight in Texas. So, from a timing perspective, this is very, very helpful because obviously FM7, which we will add, will bring significant efficiency to that business.  We'll obviously get some other components from those efficiencies that we believe might help, meaning the volume of that market more, combining that with what we see in PLC. That's a very attractive trifecta in a marketplace that seeing increasing pricing right now.\nKeith Hughes: Okay great. Thank you.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTimna Tanners: Yeah, hey, good morning. Thanks.\nC. Howard Nye: Hi Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Wanted to just explore the cement shortage discussion a little bit more. And what alleviates that, if there needs to be incremental capacity or if this is just a logistic shortage, there's been a little bit of imports from Mexico and I just wanted to get a little bit more of your perspective about how that plays out. If this is a true shortage or if it's just about labor and logistics or -- your thoughts that'll be great.\nC. Howard Nye: Timna, thank you for the question and the fact is, I think it's going to be -- well, it's real. It's tight. Two, I think it's going to stay tight for a while. If we go and look at the reports that come out from the comptroller, I mean what you will see is Martin Marietta's market share. And again, this is really tied to this conversation that you and I are having, is usually around 20% in that marketplace. We see that move around a little bit. To your point, imported cement has seen its share move around overtime as well.  Historically, imported cement in Texas has been 10-12%. I think the most recent numbers I have seen, has it modestly over 17%. So that gives you a pretty good sense of that's what's having to happen as we speak to make sure that the market is actually fed. I think part of what happens in Texas too, Timna if you think about it, when you're riding in New York, you're riding on asphalt roads. When you're riding in Texas, you're riding on concrete roads and part of the reason I mentioned that is infrastructure has always been one of the higher percentages in Texas of the downstream markets that we have. We think it's going to continue to be that way.  At the same time, if we're looking at the non-residential projects that are underway in that marketplace, day 2 tend to be relatively concrete intensive because they are structural in nature. So, it's a tight yes. Are we actually going to add efficiencies and as I mentioned before, have a byproduct of what we think might be capacity to FMS 7? The answer is yes. Do I think PLC Summit that helps in that marketplace, I think that answer equally is yes. But here's something to keep in mind some West Texas with the energy sector having been where it's been over the last several years, has not been particularly  it we're seeing that market come back right now.  That's some more attractive pricing in state. And at the same time, adding capacity is number one very expensive, and number two regulatorily quite challenging. So that's my way of saying it is tight, it's not manufacturer tied, it's not a labor tight is just tight, and I think it's likely to that way for a while, so I hope that helps Timna.\nTimna Tanners: So, between energy and infrastructure still on the calm, there's, there's even more demand around the corner and not a lot of new supply, is that fair.\nC. Howard Nye: It feels like Texas is a good place to be. I think that's right.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thank you.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David MacGregor, with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nDavid Macgregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone, and Ward, good morning. It's nice to hear your characterization of the aggregates market. Right now, it's the most commercially encouraging you've seen are the best moment you've seen the best 12 years. I think that says a lot. I guess my question was with respect to the mid-year price increases and I'm just thinking back over the years, mid-year price increases always had a limited second-half benefit. But certainly, an important compounding benefits of this subsequent year. Is there anything different this year with respect to how we would phase in those mid-year price increases, maybe your ability to price backlog so maybe there's escalators in that business now that hadn't been there in the past? But I'm just wondering if there's anything different this year with respect to that phasing.\nC. Howard Nye: Yeah, I think volume is clearly going to be growing in the back half of the year and is going to be growing into next year. So, I'll say two things, David, if you think about the ASP increases that we've already seen in Q1 had a major price increases that we're putting it on April 1. Our  start thinking about this year's mid-term, mid-years in that way, as we think about next year. As a general rule and they're always exceptions to general rules as you know, as a general rule you'll recognize about 25% of a mid-year price increase in the year in which you put it, because you're protecting customers on volume that you've already committed to them.  Now, to the extent that they're going through product more quickly this year, you might recognize more. I think the primary thing that I would say relative to the mid-years, David, in fact, in my commentary, but it's the most attractive commercial market that I've seen as CEO. It's simply going to be width, breadth and amount of them. I just think we're in a place that we will see more of them at higher dollars than we've seen for a while. As I think I indicated early on, we're seeing good years that could be anywhere from a dollar a ton to $5 a ton, depending on product and market FX. And it's been long time since you and I've had that type of . \nDavid Macgregor: \nC. Howard Nye: Thanks so much, David.\nOperator: Thank you we have a question from Courtney Yakavonis, with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wondering. Obviously, very exciting to see the increase to pricing in the guidance, but you didn't change your volume outlook and I believe this is primarily due to that tight market and largely logistic constraints. Can you help us understand if you are starting to see any softness? Obviously, we're seeing freight rates come down. And then similarly just on the job site, if there's any improvement in some of the  supply chain constraints that we've been seeing is it still too early to call at this point.\nC. Howard Nye: It's a great question and, Savvy, I do think it's too early to call right now. A lot of the same constraints that we're seeing last year we continue to see right now. I will tell you at least from supply chain to us relative to our own internal capital projects. We're not seeing big issues there in large measure of our supply chain is a domestic supply chain instead of international. But I do believe we're going to be faced with for a while the same labor issues for contractors, though I think that is getting better.  I think transportation will continue to be constrained for a while. The other thing that Jim mentioned, it's not so much a supply issue, it as a cost issue. We did go back and adjust basically where we had our fuel for the rest of the year. We came into the year as I think Jim has mentioned with about a $25 million headwind on fuel, we're assuming it's going to stay there. So actually, in the guidance that we've given you, we've assumed that there's about $75 million headwind on that. So, I wanted to make sure our spoke to you about that headwind as well as what we're seeing overall in supply chain, but I think the short answer is, Courtney, it's still too early to note for sure.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Okay, great. Thank you.\nC. Howard Nye: You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, great. Thank you. Hey, Ward, I think you mentioned in a couple of occasions on this call how critical and is for the customers to get the product as quickly as in this environment today, I've heard that from others as well. Are you you needing to make incremental investments at your sites to support that or is this just a situation we're scaling proximity? You could be a leg-up right now.\nC. Howard Nye: Brent, it's a great question. And I think it's still latter. I think it's fortunate that we've been in a position that as we've gone through cycles with, we've been able to very consistently invest in our business. We've never had to pull back on the CapEx stick for such an extended period of time at such a low base that we've done intrinsic harm to the business. And in fact, if you go back overtime and you see where we've been, we've largely been around 9% of revenues relative to our CapEx and we've been consistent on what we're doing inside our business.  So, I do think that puts us in the position that we can meet customer demands when other businesses that have not been as fortunate, we have from a capital allocation perspective, on occasion, can't. But again, I think it's important to say too, that we're going to be very careful in the way that we do that because we want to make sure we're recognizing the value of our product.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you, Ward\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you, Brent.\nOperator: Thank you, we have a question from Michael Feniger from Bank of America, your line is open.\nMichael Feniger: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in when we look at your updated pricing guidance, aggregates to 9% to 11% and kind of where you started with the first quarter. How you're going to build and it looks at your exit the year above that range in the 12% to 15% range. So just why can't double-digit pricing in 2023? That's just a baseline that we should be expecting. And would that level of pricing, what type of incremental margin should we be kind of sticking about on that level of pricing as our cost base hopefully normalizes by 2023? Thanks everyone.\nC. Howard Nye: Michael, thanks for the question. I love your vision. The fact is what will talk more about 2023 when we get closer to it. I think your points a bit of and I'm ask Jim, just speak a little bit too, that type of build that we think we're gonna to see where things are going to exit. Obviously, we would not have taken up the midpoint of guidance unless we had some confidence in what we're seeing here in April but. Jim, you want to address at least the build?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. You're right. The exit momentum it'll be higher than days, Pete, growth momentum will be more accelerated, more robust at the back half of this year versus today, leading to hopefully continuation and good things into next year. So I think out makes sense what you just said. And as a mathematical matter, yes, that should imply a very robust incremental margins in the scenario that maintained those price increases, especially where you have a cost inflation of moderation scenario, which is likely to occur in 2023.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks.\nC. Howard Nye: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: There are no other questions in the Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. C. Howard Nye for closing remarks.\nC. Howard Nye: Kathryn, thank you. And thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. We're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and superior shareholder value underscored by our consistently executed strategic priorities and supportive environment in terms of demand and pricing. Integral to the long-term success of our employees, communities and stakeholders are sustainable business practices.  To learn more, we invite you to read our recently published 2021 sustainability report, which is available on the Sustainability Section of our website. We look forward to sharing our second-quarter 2022 results in delight summer. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward. And good morning, everyone. For our continuing operations. The building materials business posted record product services, revenues of $1.1% billion, a 26% increase from last year's prior quarter. And product gross profit of $137 million. Aggregate's product gross margin of 14.9% declined 640 basis points. Product shipment and pricing growth was not enough to offset increased costs for diesel, internal freight, other production costs in depreciation, depletion, and amortization. As Ward indicated earlier, our Texas cement business is benefiting from growing demand and tight supply. Cement product gross margin expanded 630 basis points to 20.3% on a relatively favorable comparison. As a reminder, first-quarter 2021 was negatively impacted by production inefficiencies and incremental storm-related costs from the Texas deep-freeze. Partially offsetting this favorability were higher energy and raw materials costs in addition to a nearly $9 million increase in planned maintenance costs. Almost half of this year's planned killed outages, and other maintenance occurred in the first quarter. With that now behind us, we expect favorable comparisons for the next three quarters versus the prior year.  We are pleased to report that both our  and 100 cement plants begin accurately producing Portland-limestone cement or PLC during the quarter. PLC which relies on a limestone substitution of carbon intends clinker was not approved for use by the Texas Department of Transportation until recently. We now expect to ship roughly 425,000 tons of PLC this year. Importantly, in addition to the lower CO_2 emissions, the production of PLC versus traditional type 1 and 2 cement creates an 8% to 10% increase in annual cement production capacity. Importantly, no incremental capital spending is required as we ramp up PLC production.  Ready-mixed concrete product gross margin declined 100 basis points to 7.3% as pricing gains did not fully offset higher costs for our materials, labor, and diesel. As a reminder, first-quarter financial results included the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested on April 1. Consistent with seasonal trends in our relevant geographies, minimal asphalt and paving activity occurs in the early months of the year. In fact, our Minnesota -based asphalt facilities, which we acquired in April 2021, were inactive during the first quarter given that market's late spring start to the construction season. In line with our expectations, the asphalt and  business posted a $13 million gross loss for the first quarter. Magnesia Specialties achieved record first-quarter product revenues of $71 million, an 8.5% increase driven by global demand for Magnesia based chemicals products. Despite top-line growth, product gross profit decreased 6% due to higher cost for energy supplies and raw materials, resulting in a 570 basis points decline in product gross margin to 37.8%. We remain focused on the discipline execution of SOAR to responsibly grow our business and deploy capital in a manner that preserves our financial flexibility and investment-grade credit rating profile. As Ward indicated earlier, we plan to use the proceeds for recently announced divestitures to advance our long-standing capital allocation priorities, which are focused on value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic investments in returning cash to shareholders through both a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and our share repurchase program while maintaining a strong Balance Sheet. We continue to expect full-year capital spending of $525 million to $550 million as we prioritize high-return capital projects, focus on growing sales, and increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion.  During the quarter, we returned $89 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share buybacks, while we repurchased nearly 131,000 shares of common stock at average price of $383 per share, we continue to anticipate a return to our target leverage ratio of 2-2.5 times by the end of the year. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times as of March 31st. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward. As you know, we don't give out quarterly guidance. So, with that in mind, I'll give you the broad-brush strokes. Q2 should be relatively in line with history, but I think the acceleration we're going to see is more pronounced in Q3 and Q4. The reasons are twofold, 1. The compounding cascading, if that's the price increases as obviously a greater effect in the longer you go into the year. But what's also may not be appreciated is the cost base, the inflation of that should moderate as the year goes on, two elements. The oil, the energy inflation, we're assuming for guidance purposes, it remains where it's at.  We don't see a reduction in oil for fuel prices. We're assuming for guidance purposes; they remain at their elevated levels. They don't come down. So, we've built that in. Now that said, last year's corresponding quarters saw increasing costs. So, on a year-over-year basis, we'll see improvement there. The other element is our DD&A is a higher percentage of sales in Q1 than typical because of the acquisitions, but meaningfully that will not increase. That's pretty much a fixed cost.  So Q2, Q3, Q4, that element will be fixed and relatively flat helping the margin expansion in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So, we'll get back, we're going to see the record or near record margins in the back half of the year on the aggregate side for those reasons. Does that answer your question, Garik? Yes. You're right. The exit momentum it'll be higher than days, Pete, growth momentum will be more accelerated, more robust at the back half of this year versus today, leading to hopefully continuation and good things into next year. So I think out makes sense what you just said. And as a mathematical matter, yes, that should imply a very robust incremental margins in the scenario that maintained those price increases, especially where you have a cost inflation of moderation scenario, which is likely to occur in 2023."

            "name": "C. Howard Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We are excited about Martin Marietta's opportunities for operational, safety and financial success in 2022 and beyond. We're off to a predictable start this year. And our company's prospects for attractive growth and value creation are outstanding. Public and private construction activity are set to expand concurrently for the first time since this industry's most recent shipment peak in 2005, supporting multi-year demand and pricing acceleration for our products.  Beyond the benefits of these notable industry dynamics and underlying market fundamentals. We're confident that continued disciplined execution of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR. Will allow for responsible and sustainable growth of our coast-to-coast footprint. As highlighted in today's release, we once again exceeded world-class safety metrics company-wide. That's an important distinction as this performance includes operations that are relatively new to Martin Marietta guardian angel culture.  We also achieved a new first-quarter record for consolidated total revenues, which increased 25% pricing gains ahead of more broadly planned April increases. Organic upstream shipment growth in 2021 acquisitions all helped drive this top-line improvement. Cost inflation, however, outpaced revenue growth, resulting in reduced first-quarter profitability and margins versus the prior-year quarter. This was expected. In fact, our guidance provided in February weighted increased profit contributions to the second half of 2022 versus historical patterns. The reasons we anticipated and articulated regarding the shift we're two-fold.  First, our annual price increases, which are some of the largest and Martin Marietta's recent history mostly become effective on April 1st, the benefit from which builds throughout the year. Second, our costs, including energy headwinds, were anticipated to be more pronounced earlier in the year since comparable periods in the previous year experienced relatively benign inflation. What was unexpected though, was the rapid escalation and energy prices and other cost inflation in recent months. Nonetheless, beyond achieved and yet to be realized annual price increases, we're confident that disciplined execution of our commercial and operational excellence initiatives will more than offset these inflationary headlines.  It's important to remember that historically, inflation supports a constructive pricing environment for upstream materials, the benefits of which endure long after inflationary pressures moderate. Our teams are actively advising customers of mid-year pricing actions, which we anticipate will be widely accepted and more aggressive in scope and magnitude than we were initially considering a few months ago. Longer-term, Martin Marietta is well-positioned to execute on our value over volume pricing strategy and benefit from what is expected to be an increasingly more favorable and extended pricing cycle.  Confidence in our near- and long-term outlook is further underpinned by the disciplined execution of our SOAR 2025 priorities. During the quarter, we continue to optimize and enhance our aggregate SLED portfolio. We completed the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas ready-mix concrete businesses to the nation's largest privately-owned concrete producer on April 1. We also recently entered into an agreement to sell our Redding cement plant, related cement distribution terminals, and 14 ready-mix concrete plants in California to CalPortland Company. We expect to complete this transaction in the second half of 2022.  Collectively, these portfolio optimization actions both strengthened the durability of our business through economic cycles and enhance our margin profile. We intend to deploy the proceeds from these sales to advance our long-standing capital allocation priorities, facilitating higher-return, external, and organic growth investments to further enhance shareholder value. Before discussing our updated for your guidance, let's level set first-quarter results relative to the rest of 2022. While profits were lower than last year's for the reasons just discussed, the key takeaway is that the first quarter does not represent the beginning of a price cost margin compression trend.  Rather, we believe it's the end of the margin compression dynamic for the company, the scale, frequency, and efficacy of our price increases provide us the confidence to forecast full-year margins for 2022 exceeding those of 2021. In short, we believe better than expected aggregates pricing realization and contributions from our newly acquired West Coast operations will offset the divested earnings and expected inflationary headwinds.  As a result, we've reiterated our full-year adjusted EBITDA midpoint guidance of $1.75 billion. As pricing momentum continues to build during the spring construction season, we anticipate that further pricing upside is probable. Accordingly, we'll revisit our full-year guidance after the second quarter. Turning now to first-quarter operating performance for our upstream and downstream businesses, organic aggregate shipments increased to 2.5%, reflecting growing public and private demand at the onset of the construction season. Encouragingly, Infrastructure shipments increased 6%, the largest percentage increase we've seen in several years. Acquired operations contributed an additional 4 million tons. Underpinned by our value over volume strategy, organic aggregates pricing increased 6.5% or 4.6% on a mix adjusted basis and reflected improving long haul shipments from higher-priced distribution yards. All divisions contributed to this pricing growth. As the largest cement producer in Texas, we continue to benefit from tight supply and robust product demand.  Shipments exceeded 1 million tons and increased 10% setting a new first-quarter record. Cement pricing grew 12% from multiple actions taken in 2021 and the resurgence and demand for higher-priced specialty products. With a $12 per ton increase effective April 1 and our recently announced second round increase of an additional $12 per ton effective July 1, the Texas cement pricing outlook is extremely attractive. Organic ready-mix concrete shipments remained relatively flat despite the completion of several large and typically higher priced, portable projects.  Organic concrete pricing grew 8% following off cycle price increases and the implementation of fuel surcharges. Organic asphalt shipments decreased 3% as significant snowfall in January and February hindered Colorado construction activity. Organic asphalt pricing improved 6%. Looking beyond the first quarter, we remain confident that attractive market fundamentals and strong demand across our three primary end-use markets will drive aggregates-intensive growth and favorable pricing trends for Martin Marietta for the foreseeable future.  Enhanced infrastructure investments should drive aggregate shipments to this end-use closer to our 10-year historical average of 40% of total shipments. For reference aggregates to the infrastructure market accounted for 32% of first-quarter organic shipments. Department of Transportation budgets for our top states continue to be well funded through traditional revenue sources, as well as $10 billion dollars of COVID relief aid pushing estimated lettings nicely above prior levels.  Increased funding from the Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, will further enhance the current strength of our state DOT programs, providing DOTs with increased visibility and certainty to advance their multitude of backlog projects. With full IIJA allocation available for 2023 DOT fiscal years, the majority of which began on July 1, we expect benefits to begin accruing in late 2022 and become more pronounced in 2023. Non-residential construction, which drove 36% of Martin Marietta first-quarter aggregate shipments continues to benefit from the paradigm shift in consumer and work preferences and supply chains as evidenced by increased investment in aggregates intensive warehouses, data centers, and reassuring of manufacturing facilities to the United States.  Commercial and retail construction throughout our Sunbelt markets is expected to become more significant demand driver in 2022 as it's typically follows, single-family residential development with a 9-to-12-month lag. By way of example, Charlotte, North Carolina. On an office trends are returning to pre -pandemic levels with more than 2.6 million square feet of office space currently under construction in that area. The residential construction outlook remains strong despite rising interest rates and inflationary pressures, following more than a decade of historically bold new housing construction.  Expectations are that annual single-family housing starts remain in line with early 2000 levels over the next few years. That said the United States has added over 30 million people in the intervening period. Given our company's attractive footprint in destination metropolitan areas, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit disproportionately from new home construction for the foreseeable future.  As a reminder, construction of single-family homes in subdivisions is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction. Given further, community build out of light non-residential and infrastructure. Aggregates to the residential market accounted for 26% of our first-quarter organic shipments. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically, our first-quarter financial results and liquidity, Jim. Thanks, Jim. To conclude, we expect 2022 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. We're well-positioned to capitalize on Infrastructure tailwinds, and strong private demand across our differentiated coast-to-coast geographic footprint. Looking ahead, we expect this increasing demand environment to drive multiyear shipment growth and attractive pricing for our products. Our team remains committed to employee health and safety.  Commercial and operational excellence. Sustainable business practices, and the execution of our store of 2020 -- 25 initiatives as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates lead public company. If the Operator will now provide the required instructions, will turn our attention to addressing your questions. That's right. I'm happy to, Trey, to answer the question. I guess a couple of things. First, we are actually comfortably ahead of plan right now. So that's part of what we think is not yet predictable about us because where we're sitting, where we're not in a whole, we're actually ahead of where we thought we would be. As you know, the first quarter is never a big quarter for volumes, so small percentages can -- or small numbers can make for big percentage in the first quarter.  Part of what I think from my perspective was predictable is we didn't have tiller last year in the first quarter. Obviously, that's a Minnesota base business and you're not going to put down a lot of asphalt in Minnesota in January, February, and March. The other thing that support, and Jim outlined it in his commentary as well, we actually accelerated some of the maintenance on the kilns in Texas this year. So, we're about halfway through with dollars, or more than halfway through with dollars that we're going to have on that. So, I think both those are important. Obviously, we did see degrees of inflation. But the other thing that we've seen, and I think this is to your point, Trey, on what gives us confidence to actually take our guidance up a bit, is what we're seeing commercially relative to pricing. We -- obviously, you're seeing price increases go in in April. We would not take up the guidance unless we were seeing what was happening in April and had a high degree of confidence in that. The other thing, Trey, that I think is different about right now, but in some respects, predictable is what we're seeing relative to mid-year price increases as well. So, number 1, the April price increases have come into where that we thought.  Number 2, we're looking at much more widespread mid-year price increases across our footprint than we've seen in a while. As you recall, last year when we did that, we talked about targeted mid-year price increases. This year we're talking about widespread. In other words, if we're not going to have a mid-year, that's going to be the exception this year. And we're also seeing that in scope from a dollar a ton the $5 dollar a ton depending on market, depending on product, etc. Part of what we're seeing, and this is a bit of a fundamental shift, customers are considerably more concerned today about getting product than they are relative to price.  So again, an attractive place for us to be if we're talking about timing of mid years. It's probably they're going to come in somewhere between July 1, in most markets as late as September 1, and others. But I mean, to give you a sense of it, this goes at least back to a part of your question relative to the acquired operations. If we're looking to price increases that we're looking at in California right now, we're looking at $2 a ton that's going to be effective mid-year July 1.  And again, that represents a double-digit percentage increase versus the January 1 ASP. So, you're seeing that nice building effect in that market. Even if we go to a heritage market and look at Central Texas, what we're talking to customers about very candidly there is a 10% increase in July 1 across-the-board at locations and on products. Still as we're looking at where we sit relative to the new acquisitions, if we're looking at the investments that we've made, the  business here at first quarter.  And we're looking at the overall price increases and we're looking at the fact that despite the inflation that we saw in Q1, we're comfortably ahead of plan, that gives you a sense of it was predictable about about it, but hopefully it gives you a sense of where we are in areas that gives us the confidence to take the guidance up. Thanks Trey. Take care. Kathryn, to answer the question, I guess several things. One, if we just look at customer backlog, and that's important to think about, the best way we speak to it, if we're looking at aggregates, then it gets up about 11% year-over-year. So again, a very attractive number. If we're looking at cement to your point, it's basically sold out. If we're looking at Magnesia Specialties, chemicals has a record backlog right now. The customer backlogs look very, very attractive to us now.  Equally, if we look at downstream or the different end uses, obviously, we looked at Texas, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, those are our leading states. But here's the high-class dilemma that we have. We're looking at FY22 loadings in Texas, the TxDOT up $10 billion as the highest in five years. If you look at Colorado DOT, as you recall, Kathryn, they passed a 10-year infrastructure bill with $5.3 billion tied up in that. If we're looking at North Carolina, obviously, we're looking to recently passed date by any in budget, it's got a $4.2 billion number for FY22, and it's going up 17 -- where it's up 17% over where it was and it's going to be higher for '23.  This is my way of saying state budgets are very good. Our ability to put the product on the ground to meet the customer's needs is there. So we are not concerned about meeting their needs. What I think is also important, though, is trying to address in my comments around non-res. We're seeing more office building taking place. We're seeing more  taking place. And I think a lot of that is driven by where we have built our business.  And again, you've heard us speak for a while that where you are in this industry matters a great deal. So if we're looking at reshoring, whether it's Toyota come into  us. We now have Vietnamese car manufacturing in North Carolina. We're looking at Samsung north of Austin. These sorts of large, significant commercial projects. But I also think to comment that I gave you in my prepared remarks around office and retail and what we're seeing in markets on Charlotte is important.  But again, trying to close up at least in part, but I'm saying relative to end markets, we continue to see even on the residential side, underdog conditions, and we continue to see very attractive population inflow into our markets. I think some different states, not Martin Marietta states, may see some degree of push back as mortgages move. We're not seeing that and the fact is mortgage rates are up 200 basis points. This versus the prior-year quarter. But as we go back and even look at that, there's no correlation between mortgage rates in single-family starts over the past four years.  So, but I've tried to do in response to your question, just give you a snapshot of. What is it look like at the state level relative to Infrastructure? What we're seeing in non-res book on light and heavy size. And keep in mind, on the heavy side of that, we believe we're going to see increasing LNG activity in south Texas, but quite is already better. And again, residential in our states with very high population inflows looks good. Part of what we've done, Kathryn, as you know, is our capital allocation priorities through cycles has had us in a position that we've added capacity or efficiencies where we needed to and we're in a position to date to meet customer demands and their needs.  At the same time, we recognize we have a very valuable product in the ground and we're going stick with our value over volume philosophy. I think the way all of that is going to coalesce. We will have the product, we meet the customer's needs, and we'll create enduring value for our stakeholders as well. So, Kathryn, I hope that helps. Thank you. Stanley, happy to -- good to hear your voice and thank you for the question. Part of what I think is helping us commercially, Stanley, is where we are. And if we go back, the states that I was listing through when we look at the states that are most important to us from a revenue perspective, these were attractive places to be. I mean being in Texas today, being in Colorado, being in California, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, where population trends are very powerful, helps us. Having leading positions in those states helps us as well. I think to your point, if we go back and look at the investments we've made, whether it's in North Carolina, or Texas or Colorado or someplace else, as markets get tighter and customers need product, we're clearly going to be in the position to do that.  Part of what we're seeing in some circumstances today is customers have gone up for quotes and the suppliers are unable to meet those requirements at this time, we end up having the ability to come back and at times fill orders that we did not get into first instance because we are very consistent with a value over volume philosophy. And again, we're unapologetic about that, so I think several things. One, it's about the location, Stanley.  Two, it is about the philosophy that we bring to it and three it does go back to the capital allocation priorities that we've had and you've heard us long say that our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. Our next best dollar spent is on internal projects because if we're in the process of making the rocks at Big Rocks were also going to destroy iron. And we want to make sure we keep these sites well-funded, very safe, very efficient, and able to meet market demands, but also flex as demands change. And so far, we've been in a position to do that through a great recession and now through this expansion that were in, so I hope that helps Stanley. Thank you. Sure. Let me turn that to Jim and he can walk you through that place. Well, look, you know what I've always said. There are very few things in your life that you want that you can buy for $16 a ton except our profit. And to put a spec product on the ground and  for that is I think something is pretty special. Do you think if we go over time and look at the durability of aggregates pricing, one thing that it has shown is that it does have the ability through cycles to continue to move up into the right even at down cycles? I think you've got two things right now, Adam. I think you've got the demand environment that's attractive, that slightly stay attractive. I think you -- layer on top of that demand attractive, that is mighty in some very specific states where we could purposefully build our business.  And I think when you take those things together with inflation, I think you do have something that is going to be more profound for a period of time, certainly than it has been over the last several years in a marketplace that has either been flat or in some instances down in volume. So, it -- from where I'm sitting, Adam, this is the single most attractive commercial moment during my time as CEO of Martin Marietta.  So, in a 12-year period, I haven't seen anything that looks more attractive than this does. And obviously, we'll talk more about '23 as we get closer to it next year. But keeping in mind, we're not going to feel meaningful input from the IIJA in this calendar year. You're going to start to see that next year there's nothing in what we're seeing that doesn't give me a sense that we're going to be in a very attractive aggregates pricing cycle for a period of years. Thank you, Adam. And I'm happy to full. Thanks for the question. So, look, you go back over time and think about what we put on the ground back in 2005, 2006, we put 205 million tons in the ground back in 2005. We've added, let's call it 40 million - ish tons or more of capacity since then. And as you can see, we were modestly over 200 million tons last year. That's my way of saying, as we see this ramp up, we can meet whatever is going to be required. Number 2, if we think about cadence, so I would say several things. One, please remember there's about $10 billion of COVID relief aid that you're going to see going into the flow this year.  So, I think that's going to be helpful relative to cadence, particularly in the back half of the year. The other thing to keep in mind from last year is there were about $7 billion in new vote or approved initiatives that were passed last November, and about 4.5 of that was in Texas all by itself. So, what I would say to you is here at half 2 this year, we're going to start feeling I would say a bit of IIJA. We're going to feel the considerable amount of the $10 billion. We're going to start to feel portions of that $7 billion as we roll into 2023.  Typically, if we think about the way a highway bill rolls out, in Year 1, you're going to see about 20% to 25% spot. so that's going to be in '23. In Year 2, it tends to be around 40%, so again, that's going to be and '24. And then the balance of it over the following years. So, it's a practical matter if we're really looking at '23, '24, '25, '26, and '27. Those are going to be the IIJA impacted years and I think that's likely to be the type of roll out that we're going to see, and I think remembering that that's going to be augmented by what we've seen in COVID relief funds together with the voter approved initiatives, is the right way to think of it. So hopefully those percentages at least gave you some direction on that as well. So, I'm sorry about that. Look, what we're seeing on LNG side is several folds. One, as you recall, field there are several large projects in south Texas that combined have about 13.5 million tons of stone that can be required. Right now, we've got generally one of those jobs we've actually seen a change order on that. That's what the Golden Pass job. So, we're actively involved in that. The fact is whether it's Port Arthur, Rio Grande, Chevron Phillips or Schneier a number of those either have final bids that are going in or there and the processes sorting out exactly where they're going to be.  We believe with energy prices at an elevated level, we are likely to see continued activity there. The other thing that we're seeing it again, I'm sure this is not surprised to is we're seeing more wind activity across the United States. We're also seeing more solar activity across the United States. So, energy is likely going to be an area that we will continue to see activity ramp up. Up in competency at least two different wind farms that are looking for product right now. So, I think between LNG, wind farms and solar, all of which are more aggregates and sensitive than you might otherwise believe. That's going to be a pretty attractive end-use for us for a while with a lot of potential times. Thanks, Phillip. Agreed. Michael, we don't hear you. We're not sure if you're on mute or not there. There you are. It can happen. Let's start first with what we've done, what we brought in. And I would say they are all performing at or better than we would've thought. If we look at the Lehigh transaction, California, again, it's ahead of internal expectations after Q1 and by that, I mean on volume, on price, on EBITDA. These assets, we believe have substantial earnings growth and aspects people,  that's in the process of being unlocked. We're talking with our new teammates on the way that we'd like to think about the way running one of those businesses looks like. We talked about the fact that we've successfully put in attractive January 1 increases for all product lines and California.  I think also mentioned that we've got mid-years coming in in that marketplace as well. Again, that's gonna to be around $2 a ton in California. So again, we're very pleased with what we're seeing there. Tiller has been a wonderful acquisition for us as well. Keep in mind in Q1, Tiller is not going to do much because Minnesota just doesn't have that much going on.  But if we look at what we've seen in that business, Number 1, it's a very good business when we bought it. Number 2, we think it's going to be one of the best in class and what Marietta relative to cash flow conversion, we think it's going to be that way for generations to come. It's got very attractive aggregates business, but it also has a very attractive hot mix business and marketplace in which Minnesota has a very aggressive Department of Transportation budget. The other thing that's been important to us there, and it's been a very nice value-add, is some of the excess properties that we've been able to sell that have come out of that business as well. So all-in-all as we're mining there, a lot of it sand and gravel and we're reclaiming property and turning it into very attractive commercial operations or pads going forward, that's been a very attractive business for us.  So, I would tell you that there's been nothing in the major transactions that we did last year that has in any respect been a disappointment. In fact, they've all exceeded what we would have believe. Relative to the optimization, as you would imagine, part of what we've been focused on is what we've long said we are and that it's we are an aggregates led company. At the same time, if we look at the portfolio that we have, I will tell you very candidly, we're very pleased with the portfolio that we have.  So, I wouldn't be looking for enormous changes in that portfolio, but you'll also see with the shifts that we've made and the sale of the ready-mix business in Colorado and Central Texas that we've done, if you look at the initial portfolio breakdown on product line contributions on what it look like before that transact and what it looked like after that transaction, obviously, the aggregates lead portion of it went up fairly notably. And what you'll also see is that we're looking for about a 120 basis points of margin improvement with what we've done relative to the portfolio as well. What you and I know is. Different markets are built differently and some markets you need to be vertically integrated in some markets you don't. Obviously, if we think about the business that we have in Texas, we're the largest aggregates player with the largest  player and the largest ready-mix player. And we think that's an important way to face the market. Equally, if we look at the business that we have in Arizona today, the ready-mix business that we have in Arizona is a very, very attractive ready-mix business.  So, part of what we've done over a period of nearly 30 years now is trying to be very purposeful in where we have built our portfolios, how we built it and what the products are. And we believe with what we've already done and what we had pending right now relative to the sale of Redding in Northern California, the ready-mix in California. And then the preferred transaction that we have with CalPortland relative to . It's a lot of moving parts, but we think it's all value additive moving parts. Thank you so much. Mark. Look, thanks for the question on that. So, a couple of things. 1. It doesn't sell for anything that's markedly higher. Part of what is happening with it, Keith, is different departments of transportation have gone about the process of either approving it or not approving it on different timelines. So, it -- frankly, it's now allowed by TxDOT. The short answer is it performs very similar to type one and type two cement, it certainly helps us, Jim outlined with incremental capacity.  It does lower raw material costs and it puts you in a position that you can use less carbon intensive clinker over time as well, so they are just a series of components to it that from a cost input perspective, from an environmental perspective, and the capacity perspective that end up being actually very attractive. And as you know, Keith, we're cement producer in Texas and cement is very tight in Texas. So, from a timing perspective, this is very, very helpful because obviously FM7, which we will add, will bring significant efficiency to that business.  We'll obviously get some other components from those efficiencies that we believe might help, meaning the volume of that market more, combining that with what we see in PLC. That's a very attractive trifecta in a marketplace that seeing increasing pricing right now. Thank you, Keith. Hi Timna. Timna, thank you for the question and the fact is, I think it's going to be -- well, it's real. It's tight. Two, I think it's going to stay tight for a while. If we go and look at the reports that come out from the comptroller, I mean what you will see is Martin Marietta's market share. And again, this is really tied to this conversation that you and I are having, is usually around 20% in that marketplace. We see that move around a little bit. To your point, imported cement has seen its share move around overtime as well.  Historically, imported cement in Texas has been 10-12%. I think the most recent numbers I have seen, has it modestly over 17%. So that gives you a pretty good sense of that's what's having to happen as we speak to make sure that the market is actually fed. I think part of what happens in Texas too, Timna if you think about it, when you're riding in New York, you're riding on asphalt roads. When you're riding in Texas, you're riding on concrete roads and part of the reason I mentioned that is infrastructure has always been one of the higher percentages in Texas of the downstream markets that we have. We think it's going to continue to be that way.  At the same time, if we're looking at the non-residential projects that are underway in that marketplace, day 2 tend to be relatively concrete intensive because they are structural in nature. So, it's a tight yes. Are we actually going to add efficiencies and as I mentioned before, have a byproduct of what we think might be capacity to FMS 7? The answer is yes. Do I think PLC Summit that helps in that marketplace, I think that answer equally is yes. But here's something to keep in mind some West Texas with the energy sector having been where it's been over the last several years, has not been particularly  it we're seeing that market come back right now.  That's some more attractive pricing in state. And at the same time, adding capacity is number one very expensive, and number two regulatorily quite challenging. So that's my way of saying it is tight, it's not manufacturer tied, it's not a labor tight is just tight, and I think it's likely to that way for a while, so I hope that helps Timna. It feels like Texas is a good place to be. I think that's right. Thank you, Timna. Yeah, I think volume is clearly going to be growing in the back half of the year and is going to be growing into next year. So, I'll say two things, David, if you think about the ASP increases that we've already seen in Q1 had a major price increases that we're putting it on April 1. Our  start thinking about this year's mid-term, mid-years in that way, as we think about next year. As a general rule and they're always exceptions to general rules as you know, as a general rule you'll recognize about 25% of a mid-year price increase in the year in which you put it, because you're protecting customers on volume that you've already committed to them.  Now, to the extent that they're going through product more quickly this year, you might recognize more. I think the primary thing that I would say relative to the mid-years, David, in fact, in my commentary, but it's the most attractive commercial market that I've seen as CEO. It's simply going to be width, breadth and amount of them. I just think we're in a place that we will see more of them at higher dollars than we've seen for a while. As I think I indicated early on, we're seeing good years that could be anywhere from a dollar a ton to $5 a ton, depending on product and market FX. And it's been long time since you and I've had that type of . It's a great question and, Savvy, I do think it's too early to call right now. A lot of the same constraints that we're seeing last year we continue to see right now. I will tell you at least from supply chain to us relative to our own internal capital projects. We're not seeing big issues there in large measure of our supply chain is a domestic supply chain instead of international. But I do believe we're going to be faced with for a while the same labor issues for contractors, though I think that is getting better.  I think transportation will continue to be constrained for a while. The other thing that Jim mentioned, it's not so much a supply issue, it as a cost issue. We did go back and adjust basically where we had our fuel for the rest of the year. We came into the year as I think Jim has mentioned with about a $25 million headwind on fuel, we're assuming it's going to stay there. So actually, in the guidance that we've given you, we've assumed that there's about $75 million headwind on that. So, I wanted to make sure our spoke to you about that headwind as well as what we're seeing overall in supply chain, but I think the short answer is, Courtney, it's still too early to note for sure. You're welcome. Thank you. Brent, it's a great question. And I think it's still latter. I think it's fortunate that we've been in a position that as we've gone through cycles with, we've been able to very consistently invest in our business. We've never had to pull back on the CapEx stick for such an extended period of time at such a low base that we've done intrinsic harm to the business. And in fact, if you go back overtime and you see where we've been, we've largely been around 9% of revenues relative to our CapEx and we've been consistent on what we're doing inside our business.  So, I do think that puts us in the position that we can meet customer demands when other businesses that have not been as fortunate, we have from a capital allocation perspective, on occasion, can't. But again, I think it's important to say too, that we're going to be very careful in the way that we do that because we want to make sure we're recognizing the value of our product. Thank you, Brent. Michael, thanks for the question. I love your vision. The fact is what will talk more about 2023 when we get closer to it. I think your points a bit of and I'm ask Jim, just speak a little bit too, that type of build that we think we're gonna to see where things are going to exit. Obviously, we would not have taken up the midpoint of guidance unless we had some confidence in what we're seeing here in April but. Jim, you want to address at least the build? Thank you, Michael. Kathryn, thank you. And thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. We're confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and superior shareholder value underscored by our consistently executed strategic priorities and supportive environment in terms of demand and pricing. Integral to the long-term success of our employees, communities and stakeholders are sustainable business practices.  To learn more, we invite you to read our recently published 2021 sustainability report, which is available on the Sustainability Section of our website. We look forward to sharing our second-quarter 2022 results in delight summer. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacqueline, you may begin.\nJacklyn Rooker: Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nicholas. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by the United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results, or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward and I will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our 2023 financial highlights and operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation in more detail. After which, Ward will conclude with end market trends and our 2024 outlook. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Jacklyn, thank you. Good morning and thank you so much for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report 2023 was the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. We delivered both record financial performance, eclipsing $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and also world-class safety results, achieving a world-class total injury incident rate for the third year in a row and a world-class lost-time incident rate for the seventh consecutive year. This year was also highlighted by several portfolio enhancing transactions significantly strengthening both the durability of our business and our balance sheet and which cumulatively, positions us well to continue delivering sustainable growth. Our 2023 achievements were accomplished despite a macroeconomic environment encumbered by restrictive monetary policy, a housing slowdown, and heightened geopolitical tensions. That our team was able to successfully overcome these challenges further underscores the continued success of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan, the vitality of our purposely curated geographic footprint, our team's steadfast execution of our proven value over volume commercial strategy, and the resiliency and earnings power of our aggregates-led business. Subsequent to year-end, on January 12th, we closed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, expanding our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area. More recently, on February 11, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia aggregates operations of Blue Water Industries, a closely held pure-play aggregates producer with a portfolio of 20 active operations and attractive Southeast markets, including Nashville, Knoxville, and Miami. Consistent with our SOAR plan upon closing of the Blue Water Industries acquisition, which is expected to occur later this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, these two pure-play aggregates transactions will not only add approximately 1 billion tons of high-quality reserves in specific SOAR-targeted markets, but also enhance the product mix of our portfolio. Assuming these transactions have closed on January 1, 2024, we would have expected these two acquisitions to generate approximately $180 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, more than offsetting the adjusted EBITDA divested in the February 9, 2024 sale of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. As we turn the page to 2024, favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy and giving effect to the recently closed Colorado acquisition and Texas divestiture, we expect to deliver consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. However, assuming these transactions and the recently announced Bluewater Industries' acquisition had all been completed as of January 1, 2024, we would have expected the new portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion in 2024 at the midpoint. Before discussing our full year 2023 results, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter. Aggregates pricing increased 15%, driving product line gross profit of $328.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 36.8% and gross profit per ton of $7.04, a year-over-year increase of 39.8%, both fourth quarter records. While aggregate shipments decreased 2.1%, these financial results clearly demonstrate the success of our sales team's commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves. The primary and disproportionate organic earnings growth driver of our business. Turning now to our full year 2023 results. As previously noted, we established new financial records in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated total revenues of $6.8 billion, a 10% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $2 billion, a 42.1% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $19.32, a 41% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, a 33% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.93, a 46.4% increase. Moreover, we successfully implemented midyear price increases across the majority of our markets as we endeavor to pass through persistently high cost inflation. Shifting now to our full year 2023 operating performance beginning with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 4.3%, the combined result of our value over volume strategy and softer demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing increased to 18.9% or 17.2% on a mix-adjusted basis as pricing fundamentals remain attractive. Texas Cement shipments decreased 3.4% to 4 million tonnes. Pricing increased 22% or 21.6% on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 12.1%, but that reduction was largely driven by the April 2022 divestiture of the company's Colorado and Central Texas concrete businesses. Pricing increased a robust 20.4%. Asphalt shipments increased 3.5% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing end market trends and our 2024 outlook, Jim will now discuss our full year financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we completed the sale of our South Texas Cement plant and related concrete operations last week on February 9th. While these businesses were classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of December 31st, revenues and profits from these operations through the divestiture date are included in the earnings from continuing operations. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are included in both 2023 as reported earnings from continuing operations and in our 2024 earnings guidance through the February 9th close date. The revenues and profits from the Colorado assets acquired on January 12th, 2024, also are included in our forward earnings guidance. Lastly, the Bluewater Industries transaction has not yet closed and remain subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. Accordingly, the contributions from the pending acquisitions are not included in our 2024 earnings guidance. That said, we will provide updated earnings guidance after closing Bluewater transaction, which is expected to occur later this year. The Building Materials business posted full year 2023 revenues of $6.5 billion, an increase of 10.3% and gross profit of $1.9 billion, a notable 43.7% increase year-over-year, both new records. The aggregates business achieved all-time record revenues in 2023, growing 10.9% to $4.3 billion. Gross profit increased 40.1% to $1.4 billion, and gross margin increased 660 basis points to 32%. Again, both all-time records. Solid pricing growth more than offset lower shipments, further demonstrating how the disciplined execution of our value over volume, commercial strategy yields, higher profits and higher margins even without the benefit of growing volumes. Our Texas Cement business extended its track record of outstanding performance and once again delivered record top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 17% to $725.5 million and gross profit increased 64.6% to $333.6 million, driven primarily by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and energy cost tailwinds. As a reminder, the new finish mill at our Midlothian, Texas plant in North Texas is expected to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024, adding approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high margin annual production capacity. Moving to our targeted downstream businesses. Our concrete revenues increased 5.9% to $1 billion and gross profit increased 44.2% to $102 million, driven primarily by pricing gains and mega project contributions, which more than offset higher upstream, raw material, and delivery costs. Asphalt and paving revenues increased 12.6% to $887.1 million. Gross profit increased 34.7% to $109 million. The result of strong demand and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties full year revenues increased 3.8% to $315.4 million, while gross profit increased 6.9% to $97.1 million. Strong pricing and energy cost tailwinds more than offset weaker demand in certain magnesia end markets, including TPO roofing and cobalt mining. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business. In 2023, we invested $650 million of capital into our business and returned $324 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times as of December 31st, assuming the Albert Frei & Sons and Bluewater Industries' acquisitions and South Texas Cement and related concrete operations divestiture were effective as of January 1st, 2024, after giving effect to the impacts of these transactions, our net debt to EBITDA ratio would have been 1.85 times, just below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which would provide ample dry powder to take advantage of additional value-enhancing acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward to discuss end market trends.\nWard Nye: Jim, thanks so much. We're enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate healthy demand in public and heavy non-residential construction will largely offset softness in the residential sector and expected moderation in light non-residential construction. However, anticipated decreases in mortgage rates should provide tailwinds in residential demand and an uptick in single-family home construction as evidenced by recent [Indiscernible] data. As you've heard us say for years in this business, where you are matters and Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these long-term secular trends. Infrastructure activity is expected to remain resilient as funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, along with record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, as well as voter-approved state and local transportation-related ballot initiatives coalesce to per years of steady investment and demand. The value of state and local government highway, bridge, and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, grew 8% to $113 billion in 2023. According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, Texas, Colorado, California, Georgia, and Florida, key Martin Marietta states are among some of the largest growing markets based on contract awards. Importantly, our investment in our nation's infrastructure continues to maintain broad bipartisan support. During the November 2023 election, voters approved 88% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $7 billion of additional infrastructure funding. We expect this enhanced level of federal, state, and local infrastructure investment will yield steady, multiyear demand in this important aggregates-intensive often countercyclical end market. Moving to non-residential and starting with heavy industrial, strong demand for large manufacturing and heavy side energy projects is expected to counterbalance ongoing moderation in warehouse and data center construction from its COVID peak. Construction spending from manufacturing in the United States continues to trend positively with the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $214 billion, a 61% increase from the December 2022 value of $133 billion. Manufacturing projects continue to be supported by health demand from the ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, including semiconductors and electric vehicle battery manufacturing. As an example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Toyota announced an $8 billion expansion to their battery manufacturing campus in North Carolina, bringing their total investment to approximately $14 billion. This incremental investment solidifies North Carolina is Toyota's central hub for lithium-ion battery production in North America with this campus having over 7 million square feet. Importantly, our quarries are well-positioned to supply the aggregates needs for this type of multiyear project. Shifting to light non-residential, while demand remained resilient through 2023 despite higher interest rates, high office vacancy rates, and tighter commercial lending additions, we expect 2024 demand in this segment to moderate as it generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Given the structural housing deficit and favorable population trends in key Martin Marietta markets, we fully expect the affordability-driven single-family residential slowdown will recover as interest rates declined further and monthly mortgage payments become relatively more affordable. Although there's still near-term uncertainty, we're encouraged by recent trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregate demand, which were 1 million units in December, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we expect 2024 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. As previously mentioned, we anticipate flat aggregate shipments as infrastructure and large-scale non-residential projects should largely offset softness in the residential and light non-residential sectors. With steady product demand, supporting favorable commercial dynamics and the disciplined execution of our value over volume strategy, we expect double-digit aggregates pricing growth to overcome inflationary pressures and lead to expanded gross margins and unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses and contributions from our recently acquired Colorado assets, we are confident in our expectations for consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting performance in 2023. We demonstrated our ability to successfully navigate another challenging macroeconomic environment and deliver superior returns for shareholders. As we begin the new year, our teams remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial, and operational excellence, sustainable business practices, and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build the safest, best-performing, and most durable aggregates-led public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum in driving responsible and profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Please ask your question.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, good morning Ward and Jim. You guys have been quite busy and first wanted to congratulate you and the team on the recent acquisition announcement, they look like great assets and a great fit for you guys.\nWard Nye: Thank you very much. A busy weekend, I'll tell you that.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, I bet it was. On that note, Jim, and you touched on it, but could you -- could you help us with a bit more detail on how to bridge the guide for the full year? Maybe help us understand and quantify what is included, what is not included as we look at the guide for 2024?\nJim Nickolas: Yes, sure. Happy to do that. So, we've closed now on two transactions, the acquisition of Al Frei, that is in -- and that -- you can think about that maybe between $40 million and $45 million of EBITDA coming from that business. And then we've also closed the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and ready-mix business. And you can think about that as around $170 million of EBITDA that was divested. So, those are coming out of what you would have seen from the 2023 view. The Bluewater acquisition, call it, $135 or so million of EBITDA that is not -- that would be a full year run rate view that is not included in our guide. We will, of course, include that -- when that closes, we'll update our guidance for that additional EBITDA at that point. But hopefully, that provides the necessary ins and outs for you to make that work.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, that's helpful. Got it. And one more, if I could. I'm located not too far from some of your locations. And it's no secret, January weather was tough, particularly here in the South where we aren't used to snow and ice or sub-freezing temps for long periods of time. Can you help us on maybe how to think about that in 1Q? And anything else to note that maybe we should be aware of as we think about this first quarter?\nWard Nye: Trey, thanks a lot. I mean that's a really good question because as you recall, last year in Q1 weather was actually disproportionately good. And I think when people saw in Q1 numbers, they thought, wow, that's really something. And you know what I've long said, the first quarter can largely be made or broken by the last two weeks in March. But if you do have really challenging weather in January and February, it can put you back a little bit. So, to that end, you should expect a different cadence. I'm going to turn to Jim and ask him to give you some more detail on what that cadence is likely to look like this year. So, Jim back to you for a moment on that place.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So, Q1 2023, as Ward mentioned, was unseasonably good. That year, Q1 represented 15% of our gross profit. I'm speaking on a consolidated basis, so it's not a product-by-product. But on a consolidated basis, 15% of gross profits were earned in Q1. Again, it's a lower -- EBIT lower profit quarter. So, small changes can have big percentage impacts. And then pointing out, as you did the weather this year is worse in Q1. I'm now going to guess around 11.5% of our gross profits that occurred in Q1 of this year. So, that's about a 350 basis point drop. I would say with Q2, Q3, and Q4 would each be about a little bit more than 1 percentage points increasing versus what they were last year. Again, that's percentages of total yearly profits. Does that help?\nTrey Grooms: Yes, sir. I got it. That's super helpful. Thank you and good luck.\nWard Nye: Thanks so much. Just one bit more color on that. So, obviously, January was a really challenging month for customers and everyone else as you would imagine. February, as we've seen good weather come through, the business has done what we would have thought. So, I think that's important to note as a footnote to what Jim just took you through. But Trey, thanks for the question.\nTrey Grooms: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Please ask your question.\nStanley Elliott: Good morning Ward, Jim. Congratulations on another successful year. Ward, maybe a good time to get an update on how you guys are thinking about SOAR 2025. I mean you effectively doubled the market cap since that came out in 2020, 2021. Any comments on, I guess, the execution thus far, maybe how are you thinking about recent future and future portfolio moves and maybe tie that back into your commercial efforts?\nWard Nye: Stanley, thanks for the question. You're right. I mean, we've been really disciplined, very thoughtful in each of our SOAR five-year increments. So, if you go back in time and remember the first one came out in 2010, and that was through 2015. Then in 2015, we did SOAR 2020 than most recently, again, very cleverly SOAR 2025. And we've been able in each of those to effectively double our market cap and we're almost there now. And obviously, we still had some track ahead of us in SOAR 2025. I would say a couple of things. One, the commercial execution that you've seen us focused on is something that we will continue to be focused on. I think you see it in what we've given relative to our guide this year. Again, we're looking at ASP increases at 11% at the midpoint. And again, I think it's important to say, Stanley, that does not contemplate mid-years. That's the same type of conversation we had in 2023 as well. And you'll recall that we came back and actually had mid-years in more than half of our markets. So, again, we'll come back and revisit that at half year and see where that is. The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is you've seen what I think is a lot of very productive, very appropriate M&A. I think it's totally consistent with what we've sent to the market. We are an aggregates-led business. And part of what I moved by, if we look at simply what's occurred so far this year, two large transactions with assets coming into the organization, obviously, Bluewater still has some time to go through the Hart-Scott process. But we'll close on that transaction between Bluewater and what we've done without Frei & Sons, those are two pure-play aggregates businesses. And what I'm particularly moved by as well, if we look at our pipeline, that's what our pipeline looks like, too. I do believe our company is positioned from a quality growth perspective and a very compelling and it's an overused term, but I almost think unique position as well. So, will commercial discipline, be a piece of it? You bet. Will operational excellence be a piece of it? And we think it continue to be, particularly as we bring these businesses into our hold. But again, our ability to do shareholder value increasing transactions, we think here in the near-term, medium term and long-term is a fundamental differentiator for our business. And if we think about what value creation looks like for Martin Marietta and its shareholders, we think those are the key drivers. But Stanley, I hope that's helpful in response to your question.\nStanley Elliott: Sure does. Thanks so much and best of luck.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Stanley.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please ask your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning.\nWard Nye: Good morning.\nAnthony Pettinari: The gross profit per ton guidance of $840 million, I think, implies cost per ton up maybe mid-single-digit year-over-year. if I got that right. And I'm just wondering if you could bridge that between maybe some of your different cost inputs and any kind of assumptions around cost categories and maybe energy for the balance of the year?\nWard Nye: So, happy to take, but I'll ask Jim to go through and give you a bucket-by-bucket view. But overall, you're entirely right. If we're just looking at general inflation, it's going to be in the mid to high single-digits range. That can obviously move around a little bit, but there are some components of our business that are seeing higher pieces of inflation. I think it's important to say that labor is actually not one of those. Those numbers continue to be in a very comfortable place, both for our workforce and for our company, but let Jim take you through some of the puts and takes on some of the other inputs.\nJim Nickolas: Yes, you're right. It's about 7% inflation on the COGS -- on the aggregates business, COGS per ton. So, here are the items that are above 7% or north of 7%. Oil lubricants, we're expecting to be up quite a bit explosive, still remain high. The parts and equipment for the plants, also about the ZIP code. So, those are the areas that are pushing it above 7%, areas that are pushing it below 7 are, as Ward mentioned, labor, which is our biggest cost component and also diesel and electricity, nat gas. Those are not expected to be headwinds in 2024. So, those are the large buckets, I would say, that are deviating from the 7%, some are more than 7%, others are well below the 7%. But on a blended basis, that's where we're ending up.\nAnthony Pettinari: Got it. Got it. And the assumption for diesel is just current prices or--\nJim Nickolas: There's a smidge of a headwind in for diesel, not much off of current spot prices.\nWard Nye: So, we hope we've been a bit punitive to ourselves. We'll see how that plays out, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: No, that\u2019s very helpful. I'll turn it over.\nWard Nye: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.\nAngel Castillo: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just was curious on the recent acquisitions. I was wondering if you could help us quantify a little bit more or give us a little bit more color as to kind of upside opportunity on the pricing side as you look at those assets in those regions in terms of bringing those more to the value over volume strategy?\nWard Nye: Well, look, if we look at the overall businesses and looking at the prior business in Colorado, they were doing somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million tons of stone per annum. Denver is a very attractive marketplace. We'll have to see how that plays out. But you can go back over time and get a good sense of commercially at least how we've approached those markets. As you can imagine, the barriers to some degree of entry and hard rock can be quite high in a number of markets. So, we feel very good about our team in Colorado. They're very cost conscious. They're very commercially focused. And we think the marketplace in Denver will continue to be very attractive for an extended period of time. Keep in mind, if we go back -- let's call it, 13 years. We had no significant business at all in Colorado. We look up and down the Front Range today. We're the clear leader in aggregates up down the I-25 corridor. Remember, that's where 80%-plus the population in Colorado lives. And again, the biggest piece of it being in Denver. And now between the Walstrom quarry, which we picked up in our Spec AGG quarry, a very attractive position in that marketplace. If we go and look at Bluewater, obviously, that transaction has not closed. We're going through the Hart-Scott process soon and we're hoping to have that done half year-ish heavy on the ish, by the way. It could clearly push into the second half of the year. If we look at the overall tonnage, that's going to be around 13 million tons of stone. But importantly, if you look at the markets in which it gives us a nice footprint, these are markets that we've long talked about wanting to have a natural position. And so suddenly, we find ourselves in Nashville. Suddenly, we find ourselves in Knoxville. Now we find ourselves in a much more significant way in South Florida and around Miami. So, if you go back and take a look at the slide presentation that we gave to the analysts and investors in February of 2021, we talked about a series of markets that we wanted to enter when we talk about Northern California, Southern California, Arizona, in and around Austin, Texas. We talked about Middle Tennessee, we talked about South Florida, and we talked about in Northern Virginia. We are literally in a place now that we're putting checks in most of those boxes. So, again, if you take a look at the overall pricing at these facilities relative to our corporate average, it's modestly below our corporate average. So, again, I'm hoping I'm giving you something directionally that you can work with. But that gives you a sense of the market, it gives you a sense of the overall volume. I do think we will operationally bring increased efficiencies to these markets, and we're thrilled to, number one, have already brought the Frei team into the Martin Marietta fold, and we look forward to bringing the Bluewater team into our organization as well. So, hopefully answer that response to your question.\nAngel Castillo: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet,\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone.\nWard Nye: Good morning Jerry.\nWard Nye: I'm wondering if we just take a step back, historically, in a flat end demand environment, the industry has realized 4 points of price or less. And obviously, we're putting up much better performance here in the price/cost spread widening. As you think about what the industry learned over the course of the hyperinflation period, I guess, do you think the fear of inflation stays with the industry beyond this year? Or could we return to slower pricing cadence in 2025 towards that historical rate? I know it's super early, but I feel like the industry got burned with inflation surprising on the upside. I'm wondering -- does that change the mindset for obviously, you folks and others in your markets?\nWard Nye: Well, Jerry, the only thing I can speak to is Martin Marietta, of course. And I would say several things. One, obviously, inflation has moved significantly over the last couple of years. And we took the actions that were smart and prudent to protect our company as that went up. Secondly, at least here in our company, we recognize that having these long-lived reserves is significant. We're sitting here today at current extraction rates with reserves in excess of 70 years. Something that I think we talk about inside our company is these reserves are worth more tomorrow than they are today. In some geographies, it's very difficult to replicate or replace the reserves. And I think as we think long term, and that's how we tend to think about this business. If we go back to one of the questions that was earlier, they were asking about SOAR and the fact that we look at our business in five-year increments. But the simple fact is, Jerry, we think about our business in terms of decades, not years, not five years, but really decades. And as we look at it through that lens, we recognize that we have the product that is absolutely essential in every form of heavy side development. You don't need asphalt in every piece of it. You don't need concrete in every piece of -- but you need the aggregates in absolutely every piece of it. So, from our perspective, as we looked at what aggregate sells for on a per ton basis and then we consider, one, its vitality to a product or to a project and its overall cost relative to the project, we think we're actually adding more to an individual project than we're costing a project. That's how we think about what we're doing. So, if we go back to the notion of will commercial excellence continue to be a driver for our organization, and I think make our pricing look fundamentally different going forward than it did, say, a decade ago Yes, I think it probably will. Do I think operationally, we will continue to bring great value to the organization by making our businesses better faster, safer, more efficient, et cetera. Yes, I think we will. But I also think that what you should expect from us, and this ties to a degree to it as well, Jerry we will continue to be a very responsible, very visionary acquirer of attractive businesses in attractive geographies. And I think if you take those building blocks that I've taken you through, it gives you a good sense of how to think about the business overall from a commercial perspective.\nJerry Revich: Really appreciate the color. And then you folks have been super busy over Super Bowl weekend. And I'm wondering if you look at the M&A pipeline today now that we're wrapping up the last deal, hopefully, that announced soon. The M&A pipeline from here, word, what's the range of outcomes in terms of how much more capital we can deploy over the balance of 2024, you predicted 2024 was going to be a really active M&A year and I'm just wondering how much is left or there to do based on what's in the pipeline?\nWard Nye: Jerry, that's a great question. So, here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. Let's assume that Frei's closed, which it is, and let's assume the Bluewater was closed. We'd be leveraged at about 1.85 times. So, keep in mind, through a cycle, we like to be leveraged 2 times to 2.5 times. So, we're still, despite that degree of acquisitive activity, we're still below where we would typically like to be. So, my point is this, when we've seen attractive transactions before, we haven't done it a lot, but we've gone over 3 times. We've delevered actually very quickly and easily when we've done that. I continue to believe that there will be more transactional activity this year. I would be disappointed if there's not. You're right on our Q3 call back in November, I said at that time, I thought 2024 would be a pretty busy year. Obviously, we're about a month and a half into it. It's been a really busy year already. But Jerry, the fact is that I think there's going to be more, I'd be disappointed if there wasn't, and you should expect it to be more pure stone type transactions, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please ask your question.\nPhilip Ng: Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. If I take your guidance, Jim, I think you're calling for flattish volumes for the full year. Not too dissimilar to what you told us back on the 3Q call, but I believe your guide now includes AFS, so that would imply maybe volumes are a little softer, but everything that you mentioned, Ward, sounded pretty constructive. So, I just want to make sure we're -- one, we're not overthinking about this. And when you look out to the back half, I mean, you kind of talked about rates coming down, that could be a good guide for housing. Could volumes kind of inflect in the back half and go into 2025? Is there a good way to think about the trajectory for us?\nWard Nye: Phil, thanks for your question. A couple of things that I would say. Number one, you're right. I mean, if we're looking at bringing in Frei, and let's call it, 3.5 million tons, one thing that happened in our sale of the Hunter cement plant is we're actually doing some stone production there as well that was going into the cement production. So, in fairness, that was probably about 2 million tonnes. So, really, if you start taking a look at what went the other way in the Hunter transaction, what's going this other way near-term and Frei, keep in mind that you've got a fairly seasonally impacted business in Colorado as well. Again, I think it leads you back to that relatively flattish. So, I wouldn't strain too hard on what those numbers look like because there's just enough movement on the surface of it that it could put you in a much more comfortable place you [indiscernible] booking pure flat. To your point, though, I do believe if we see interest rate reductions and we see a steady, albeit somewhat slow recovery in housing and then what's likely to be degrees of light non-res that comes behind that in the second half of the year. I'm not sure how much is going to push volumes up in half two. I think it certainly could push volumes up in half two. I think what it's really doing is it's setting up 2025 to be even a more productive year. Obviously, on the infrastructure side, we think it's going to be pretty constructive all by itself. I mean if you think about the fact that we're looking at what's happened on highway contract awards and you're looking at basic and LTM from December 2019 through 2023, that's got almost an 11% CAGR involved in it. And then we're looking at our top 10 states and DoT budgets themselves that are up on average, 10%. And here's some percentages to keep in mind. Texas, which had a really heady budget is up 24%. Florida, which has been at record levels, it's up 9%. North Carolina, our home court is up 11%. Minnesota, when we bought the business there from Tiller several years ago, we said that was a really attractive DoT, it's up about 38%. So, again, as we're looking at public, we think that that's going to be pretty compelling. Even as we sit and move to non-res, if we're looking at manufacturing, the reshoring that we mentioned in our opening comments, is pretty significant. We continue to see more activity in that space. I also called out what we're seeing consistently in energy. We got a new battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana. There's some new one coming in the Bowling Green, Kentucky. But what I've been a bit surprised by and I think this may be more geographic intensive as well or sensitive is even in the areas that have had degrees of slowing warehouses and data centers. I mean we've got four data centers under construction right now in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. And there's a new one that looks like it's coming online in Covington, Georgia. So, again, if we look across our geographic footprint and recognize that we've been very selective in the where. Do I think there's a prospect that you could see some upside in the second half of the year on volumes? Yes, I do. I think that cadence that Jim spoke to earlier, it's important to keep in mind because clearly, we're not going to have Q1 that last year. But again, I think Q2, Q3, and Q4 could be attractive, recognizing, hey, pretty heady Q4. We just had this year, too. So, again, Phil, I hope that's helpful and constructive on the volumes and what the end users look like.\nPhilip Ng: Appreciate the great color Ward.\nWard Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Please ask your question.\nWard Nye: Tyler, you with us?\nTyler Brown: Yes, you there? Sorry.\nWard Nye: Yes sir, we hear you. Hi Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Yes, good deal. Hey Jim, I'm curious about the CapEx guide. So, it was a little bit higher than maybe we had expected, just considering the South Texas sale. Just curious what all is in that CapEx number. Was there a sizable -- was any spend in there, maybe outsized land acquisition. It just seems like 9.5% CapEx to sales feels a bit higher than normal, just particularly considering flattish volume.\nJim Nickolas: Yes, good question. Our range is between 8% to 10%, typically, 9% is the most common at the midpoint. But we do have a couple of large projects in there. And you're right, the finished mill seven is among those that's one of the larger spends in 2024 as we wrap up that project. Another one is our Beckman plant in San Antonio is getting a significant upgrade there as well. So, the largest items that are helping to push that up to a little bit more than normal, but still well within the range of what I think is typical for us.\nWard Nye: Hey Tyler, let me add this too because Jim nailed it. He's exactly right. The other thing that we're seeing, though, on occasion, and we've seen it more in the last few months is real estate purchases tends to be highly opportunistic. And when the right real estate shows up, you don't always know when it's going to parachute in and we have to have the ability to be pretty agile around that. So, we're looking at some real estate purchases as well that that we think will be important in the near, medium and again, long-term for Martin Marietta, but broadly very much in that range that Jim spoke to, but those are some of the moving parts, both above the water and under the water.\nTyler Brown: Yes. No, that is very helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Please ask your question.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thanks for taking my question today. A lot of focus on all the great M&A and divestiture activity since November, certainly a busy holiday season through Super Bowl. But one of the changes also too is just in the cadence and the type of flavor of capital expenditure, CapEx as you divest some cements and take on more aggregate-focused assets. Could you walk through what this does for free cash cadence and also how we should think about capital expenditure given the change in mix? And then thoughts on capital allocation going forward, given recent activity? Thank you.\nWard Nye: So, I'm going to start with capital allocation, and then come back to Jim, and he can just talk you through more degrees of CapEx and how things can move around. If you think about the capital allocation, Katherine, one of the more elegant things about our company is that stays pretty consistent. Our view is our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. And again, I think our teams are good at that. I think they're good at identifying the deals. So, I think they're good at going through the contracting process. I think they're good at the integration process. I think they're good at the synergy realization process. So, the right transactions will be number one on capital allocation, number two, and Jim will take you through more specifics, we'll be reinvesting in the business. As you know, if you're in the business of crushing stone, you're in the business of destroying iron. So, the fact is we will stay probably in those ranges that Jim spoke about a few minutes ago, but he going to more detail. And then lastly, is returning of cash to shareholders through two things; a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and we say both of those words very intentionally and share buybacks at the right time. So, the capital allocation priorities simply do not change. Now, more to your question on how does this portfolio evolution that we've seen change the way that we look at CapEx for that over to Jim.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So, I would expect it to go either be very constant with historical levels or maybe a little bit higher as we as we look to replant many of our aggregate plants to keep them efficient and highly automated. So, as far as cadence for the year, I would expect it to be similar to last year and the year before Q1 and Q4 a little bit heavier on the CapEx, Q2 and Q3 a little bit lighter. But of course, the things that can throw that out of whack -- on occasion would be the occasional opportunistic generation of land purchase. That would be something that could, of course, grow those percentages and historical patterns out of kilter. But hopefully, that answers the question, Kathy.\nWard Nye: And Kathryn, let me add one more note to that as well because keep in mind, when we're doing replants or otherwise, we're doing those because the income rates of return on those projects is so compelling. We almost would feel silly if we didn't do them. At the same time, part of what's still compelling about an aggregates business is we have the capacity if we need to, and we did it in COVID, and we've done it before, to pull back on that CapEx lever. If we ever need to, we don't see a need to do that. We think we can do it very constructively. We think we can do it in a very value-additive way. But again, I think as you just step back from our industry compared to others, and you look at the degrees of agility that we can bring to something like CapEx in a heavy industry is decidedly different and we think it's advantaged Martin Marietta. So, again, we hope that's responsive to your question. Jim's got one more point.\nJim Nickolas: One more point kind of an overall cash perspective, Kathryn. So, our operating cash flow grew tremendously this year. I'm comparing year-over-year now. Our CapEx did grow, but our cash conversion ratio improved in 2023 over 2022 meaningfully. So, we're very mindful of our cash flow. We think it's good and getting better even with slightly higher CapEx in 2024. We think that trend will continue.\nKathryn Thompson: Okay, great. And very helpful. And just one quick clarification on guidance on interest expense, that you released today, seeing a little light, but just wanted to hopefully can give a little bit of clarification on your interest expense guidance? Thank you.\nJim Nickolas: Sure. Yes. It's actually, it's net interest expense. So, it's gross interest expense of, call it, $160 million interest income of, call it, $100 million. So, net interest expense of about $60 million at the midpoint.\nKathryn Thompson: Great. Thank you very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Please ask your question.\nTimna Tanners: Hey, good morning. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the benefits you're seeing from IIJA and any color you can provide on the cadence that you're seeing there and your visibility? We all follow the [Indiscernible] awards data, and it's been quite strong, but kind of leveled off over the last several months. So, just wondering if you can provide some more color on what you're seeing there.\nWard Nye: Timna thank you for the question. Number one, we are starting to see that weekend to pull through. And what I would say, obviously, when you're looking at what you and I know, is a $1.2 trillion bipartisan law, that's the big amount of money. That's $110 billion to roads. It's $66 billion for railroad maintenance. It's $42 billion for port and airport infrastructure. But what's important is to start drilling down and seeing what's going on in many respects on a state-by-state or at times MSA-by-MSA basis. So, if we look at where NC DoT is, for example, their budgets up 11%. They're obviously going to see nice federal money flowing through as well. What we're basically seeing is they're increasing infrastructure funding here by $7 billion over the next decade. So, again, that starts to give you a good sense of how that money is flowing through. Texas, they're looking for FY 2024 to be another record year of lettings. That's going to be at about almost $14 billion by the way, that's up about 15% year-over-year. Their unified transportation plan for FY 2024 is expected to exceed $100 billion. Again, that's an 8% increase. So, again, the federal funds that are flowing through are a big part of that. I'm particularly moved by what we've seen happen in Florida because again, the recent Florida 2024 budget increased to $17 billion. Again, that's an all-time high, over what had been an all-time high last year. But again, as we think about what Florida is able to do because of what they're seeing from IIJA you've got the move in Florida Forward Initiative that was announced in late Q3, that's going to bring $4 billion from general revenue surplus into transportation in that state. And even as we look at what's going on in California, their recently passed FY 2024 budget includes $20.5 billion for CALTRANS and that's still a 5% year-over-year increase from FY 2023. So, if we're looking at where the states are, what they're doing with their budgets, how they're taking these funds that are also coming from the Federal government? It's a pretty compelling story, as we sit back and look at it. Jim's got a few things he wants to add as well Timna.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. Our volumes were down 2% for the quarter, but I'll point out our infrastructure volumes were actually up 6%. So, we think those are -- we're seeing it's coming through those infrastructure volumes.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And just one follow-up on all the M&A discussion. You've highlighted an appetite for bolt-ons -- but obviously, you also highlighted that you have spare bandwidth or capacity, if you will, in your debt leverage. So, I'm just wondering for the right deal, are you willing to kind of tap the capital markets? Or is it still just kind of a priority for bolt-ons as you look ahead? Thanks.\nWard Nye: For the right transaction, we would certainly do that, Timna. And again, we've demonstrated the capacity if we've done the right transactions to bring down leverage very, very quickly in the organization. So, we'll just have to look at them on a transaction-by-transaction basis. But the short answer is a lot of these, if they came along, you're only going to see them once. And it again can be very opportunistic and sitting at 1.85 times levered today, even having done all that we will have done this year taking into account Frei and Bluewater. We've got a lot of dry powder right now.\nTimna Tanners: Got it. Okay. Thanks again.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Please ask your question.\nMichael Dudas: Morning Jacklyn, Jim, Ward.\nWard Nye: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: So, following on the acquisition opportunities, just two thoughts. One, as you're going through your plan to SOAR 2025 and maybe beyond, is there a percentage or a mix of aggregates that you're targeting for the contribution for the whole company? And given that you've divested South Texas in a very efficient and cooperative manner with the purchaser, are there opportunities on the sell-side that, again, as you move to that mix target or where you want to be that could emerge over the next six to 12 months?\nWard Nye: Mike, thanks for the question. I mean, number one, if we look at where we're going to be after the transactions that we've done, our 2024 pro forma gross profit mix would be at 77% aggregates. I mean, should you expect that number to continue to grow? The answer is yes, you should. But I would say this, too and I think this is so important to state. The cement operation that we have in Midland Texas is a fantastic cement business. It's a long way from the Gulf of Mexico, we have our Southwest headquarters in Dallas. We're the largest aggregates producer in Dallas. We're the largest cement producer in Dallas. That business has just from my perspective, eye watering margins, we like the businesses that we have very much. And if we've got the ability, desire, and capacity to go and grow our aggregates business, which we do, and take that number that I just gave you 77% push that to 80% and then beyond that, frankly, you should expect us to do that. If we go back through the way that we've long described ourselves, we've said we're aggregates-led, with strategic cement, with targeted downstream. I mean those are, again, very well-conceived, well-thought out adjectives before each one of those businesses. And what you're seeing us to this year is totally consistent with an aggregates-led business and building a business that can outperform through cycles and we think that's so vital to what we're doing. And that's part of what's so important about also this value over volume philosophy that we're bringing to our business. So, yes, you should expect to see that aggregates number continue to go up. And again, that's very consistent with the pipeline that we're looking at today.\nMichael Dudas: Thank you, Ward.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Keith Hughes from Truist. Please ask your question.\nWard Nye: Keith are you there?\nKeith Hughes: Can you hear me now?\nWard Nye: Now, we hear you Keith. Yes sir.\nKeith Hughes: Okay, sorry about that. So, a question on cement and the remaining cement business for 2024, what kind of price volume expectations do you have in the guide?\nJim Nickolas: I'll give you some of that, Keith. It's getting increasingly challenging for us to give too much granularity around that cement business. because that's the only cement business that we have. So, I'm torn between -- I want to make sure I'm transparent giving you everything that you need. I also don't want to put ourselves at a remarkable competitive disadvantage. So, I'll give you an overall sense -- obviously--\nKeith Hughes: Give me what you can.\nJim Nickolas: I'll give you what I can with that -- so look, we obviously kept the larger of the two cement businesses. From a volume perspective, it's going to be modestly over two million tons. From a pricing perspective, we're looking at an increase in North Texas of around $15 per ton. That increase -- if I were you, I'd be modeling that more in an April timeframe as opposed to a January timeframe. Obviously, you saw very attractive margins in that business last year. And what I would suggest to you is our aim would be on a full year basis to maintain the types of margins in that business that you saw in the overall cement business last year in Texas. So, Keith, I hope that gives you broadly what you need.\nKeith Hughes: That\u2019s fine. Thank you.\nJim Nickolas: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Please ask your question.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on aggregates pricing. The outlook is in line with how you framed it coming out of the 3Q call, but and we appreciate your value over volume strategy, but there was a competitor last week that spoke to both trying to take share this year and pricing maybe a little bit more closely to inflation or the rate of deflation that they were seeing. I'm wondering if maybe you're seeing a change in the conversations at all with aggregates pricing going into this year? Are those becoming maybe a little bit more difficult? Maybe I'm over thinking here, but I just thought I'd ask the question on how those discussions have been going?\nWard Nye: No, Garik, it's a fair question. The conversations have actually been pretty constructive with our customers. And keep in mind, several things happen. Number one, location is going to matter a lot. Number two, relationship is going to matter a lot. Number three, I think the swing factor in some places may be what degrees of midyears declined. Again, the only place right now that we've already got stated midyears are in California, where we told people basically we're coming out of the gate in 2024 were $2 a ton up, and then we're going to do another $2 a ton at midyear. Keep in mind, too, that most of our customers are not the owner. They tend to be a general first-year tier sub, second tier sub, third tier sub, et cetera. and they tend to be cost-plus themselves. And if we're looking at being 10% of the cost of a road, 2% of the cost of a home, and somewhere between those two numbers on a non-res project. The price of the stone usually isn't why a project goes or why a contractor gets the job. But at the same time, we're placing that stone once it goes out of our gate can be pretty challenging. So, look, do I think -- do I think we will see years and years of price performance like we saw in 2023? No, I don't think that's going to be the norm. Do I think we're trending more towards -- but I think the norm will be from Martin Marietta this year? Yes, I think we probably are. And to me, that feels like an appropriate place for us to be given the economy, given the difficulties that you can have in replacing some of these reserves in some of these key markets. Remember, we have some urban quarries and locations that trying to find opportunities to come back behind quarries if they're depleted would be hugely challenging. And building new cars will put you further away from the city centers and take degrees of efficiency away. So, again, I hope that gives you, number one, a philosophy on how we approach it. Number two, what our dialogue looks like with our customers and number three, how I think it's going to play out, at least from Martin Marietta over a period of years.\nGarik Shmois: No, that's helpful. Just wanted to follow-up just quickly just on cement margins, recognizing the increasing importance size in that segment. With the finishing coming on later this year, is there any choppiness or inefficiencies that we should be aware of?\nJim Nickolas: No, I don't think so. To the extent -- I mean we're going to be very disciplined about bringing that online. It won't be disruptive to price. We think we'll be able to bring it online gradually in terms of operational approach as well as marketplace impact. It will be very disciplined, and we think it won't be very disruptive at all. So, we're not looking for any kind of noticeable effect from external view on this point. And margins should be enhanced when those come online. So we think it's really going to fit the market is sold out by and large, and we think it will fit nicely with the growing demand there.\nGarik Shmois: Understood. Thanks again and congrats on the quarter.\nWard Nye: Thanks so much Garik.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please ask your question.\nJoe Nolan: Hey, good morning. This is Joe Nolan on for David.\nWard Nye: Hi Joe.\nJoe Nolan: Hi. I just had one quick question on the aggregates volumes guidance, you provided up or down 2%. Just with that, what would be the primary drivers that you're monitoring to drive the high end or low end? And just within that, can you talk about how the value over volume strategy might play into that?\nWard Nye: Yes, happy to. I mean here's a good way to think of it, and this is not a bad laboratory to give it some thoughts. So, if we look in Q2, volume is down 2%. So, last year, we were at 47.7%. The year just ended 46.6%. If we're really looking at that and saying, what were your swing markets or what are you swing factors? Value over volume was probably modestly over 1 million tons of that. So, again, if we think -- what we actually had a better return for shareholders. We kept those reserves in the ground or we kept them in stockpiles. We'll sell them another day, we'll sell them for higher. And that was your primary driver, there was some degrees as well chronicle of market softening in degrees of residential and non-res, but the biggest piece of that was value over volume. So, if we're looking at what swing factors can be, as Jim pointed out, in the quarter, we saw infrastructure volumes up 6%, that wasn't a surprise, but really it was a nice affirmation of what's happening. So, if we continue to see public grow sensibly, if we see res start to do, but we're not predicting it, but you can certainly see that res could have a nice recovery beginning in half two. We think that's important. And again, as we're looking at these mega projects, if we're looking at non-res projects of size and of scale. Depending on how some of those play out, it doesn't take a lot of those. I mean it could take one or two of those to really change the trajectory of degrees of volume. And obviously, we're still having significant conversations on a number of large non-res projects in the Gulf of Mexico and if some of those go -- I think those are your swing factors, Joe, as you think about volumes. So, I hope that helped.\nJoe Nolan: That\u2019s very helpful detail. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nWard Nye: You bet. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Please ask your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys. Great quarter, great outlook.\nWard Nye: Thank you so much Adam. Good to hear your voice.\nAdam Thalhimer: Ward, you talked about data center weakness in Q4. That surprised me. What are you seeing going forward there?\nWard Nye: Well, I'm not sure it was so much -- I was talking more broadly about what some of the writers have said. I think what I was saying is, in our world, it hasn't been as down as people would have thought. Now, keep in mind, it was against a really tough comp. So, that's more other than anything else. But if you just look at general trade publications, they're going to say, look, in warehousing and data center, you're going to start to see some moderation simply because the comps were so high. I guess my point was not all markets are going to be equal. And I think when we start looking at the Southeastern, Southwestern and interestingly, these Midwestern markets, where there's a lot of data center activity, which was why I was calling out, in particular, part of what's happening in Nebraska and Iowa because those have been actually really resilient markets in that particular space, Adam. So, it was something I was really calling up high degrees of weakness. It was more comps are tough and the overall commentary around that is a little bit softer than in some other areas. But again, I think we're holding up better than most.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then clients ask me this, I'll just ask you, are we still early and you guys seeing the benefit from IIJA?\nWard Nye: Yes, I think -- look, I think if we're talking about that in innings, I mean we're in the very early innings of that. I mean, I think as a practical matter, 2024 is really the first year that we're going to start to see significant stone go out the gate on IIJA. So, here's the way I would think of it, Adam. 2024 on that is going to be better than 2023. 2025 is likely to be better than 2024, and I think 2026 could be better than 2025. So, in baseball parlance, we're not anywhere near the seventh inning stretch. I mean we're in a very healthy spot right now, and it's likely to be that way for a number of years.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great answer. Thanks Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Ward for the closing remarks.\nWard Nye: Again, thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's impressive 2023 results underscore the durability and resiliency of our aggregate flood business in unparalleled markets and the efficacy of our value over volume market approach. This solid foundation together with our unyielding commitment to enterprise excellence through the execution of our strategic priorities gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering industry-leading safe, financial and operational performance. With our attractive underlying fundamentals, proven strategic priorities and best-in-class teams, we're excited about our prospects for continued sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders for the foreseeable future. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2024 results in the spring. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now ended. Thank you all for joining. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Jacklyn, thank you. Good morning and thank you so much for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report 2023 was the safest and most profitable year in Martin Marietta's history. We delivered both record financial performance, eclipsing $2.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and also world-class safety results, achieving a world-class total injury incident rate for the third year in a row and a world-class lost-time incident rate for the seventh consecutive year. This year was also highlighted by several portfolio enhancing transactions significantly strengthening both the durability of our business and our balance sheet and which cumulatively, positions us well to continue delivering sustainable growth. Our 2023 achievements were accomplished despite a macroeconomic environment encumbered by restrictive monetary policy, a housing slowdown, and heightened geopolitical tensions. That our team was able to successfully overcome these challenges further underscores the continued success of our strategic operating analysis and review or SOAR plan, the vitality of our purposely curated geographic footprint, our team's steadfast execution of our proven value over volume commercial strategy, and the resiliency and earnings power of our aggregates-led business. Subsequent to year-end, on January 12th, we closed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, expanding our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area. More recently, on February 11, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Alabama, South Carolina, South Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia aggregates operations of Blue Water Industries, a closely held pure-play aggregates producer with a portfolio of 20 active operations and attractive Southeast markets, including Nashville, Knoxville, and Miami. Consistent with our SOAR plan upon closing of the Blue Water Industries acquisition, which is expected to occur later this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, these two pure-play aggregates transactions will not only add approximately 1 billion tons of high-quality reserves in specific SOAR-targeted markets, but also enhance the product mix of our portfolio. Assuming these transactions have closed on January 1, 2024, we would have expected these two acquisitions to generate approximately $180 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024, more than offsetting the adjusted EBITDA divested in the February 9, 2024 sale of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. As we turn the page to 2024, favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy and giving effect to the recently closed Colorado acquisition and Texas divestiture, we expect to deliver consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. However, assuming these transactions and the recently announced Bluewater Industries' acquisition had all been completed as of January 1, 2024, we would have expected the new portfolio to generate adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion in 2024 at the midpoint. Before discussing our full year 2023 results, I'll highlight a few notable takeaways from our record fourth quarter. Aggregates pricing increased 15%, driving product line gross profit of $328.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 36.8% and gross profit per ton of $7.04, a year-over-year increase of 39.8%, both fourth quarter records. While aggregate shipments decreased 2.1%, these financial results clearly demonstrate the success of our sales team's commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves. The primary and disproportionate organic earnings growth driver of our business. Turning now to our full year 2023 results. As previously noted, we established new financial records in each of the following year-over-year metrics. Consolidated total revenues of $6.8 billion, a 10% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $2 billion, a 42.1% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $19.32, a 41% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, a 33% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.93, a 46.4% increase. Moreover, we successfully implemented midyear price increases across the majority of our markets as we endeavor to pass through persistently high cost inflation. Shifting now to our full year 2023 operating performance beginning with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 4.3%, the combined result of our value over volume strategy and softer demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing increased to 18.9% or 17.2% on a mix-adjusted basis as pricing fundamentals remain attractive. Texas Cement shipments decreased 3.4% to 4 million tonnes. Pricing increased 22% or 21.6% on a mix-adjusted basis, driven by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments decreased 12.1%, but that reduction was largely driven by the April 2022 divestiture of the company's Colorado and Central Texas concrete businesses. Pricing increased a robust 20.4%. Asphalt shipments increased 3.5% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing end market trends and our 2024 outlook, Jim will now discuss our full year financial results. Jim? Jim, thanks so much. We're enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's prospects in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate healthy demand in public and heavy non-residential construction will largely offset softness in the residential sector and expected moderation in light non-residential construction. However, anticipated decreases in mortgage rates should provide tailwinds in residential demand and an uptick in single-family home construction as evidenced by recent [Indiscernible] data. As you've heard us say for years in this business, where you are matters and Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these long-term secular trends. Infrastructure activity is expected to remain resilient as funds from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, along with record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, as well as voter-approved state and local transportation-related ballot initiatives coalesce to per years of steady investment and demand. The value of state and local government highway, bridge, and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, grew 8% to $113 billion in 2023. According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, Texas, Colorado, California, Georgia, and Florida, key Martin Marietta states are among some of the largest growing markets based on contract awards. Importantly, our investment in our nation's infrastructure continues to maintain broad bipartisan support. During the November 2023 election, voters approved 88% of transportation-related state and local ballot initiatives, representing approximately $7 billion of additional infrastructure funding. We expect this enhanced level of federal, state, and local infrastructure investment will yield steady, multiyear demand in this important aggregates-intensive often countercyclical end market. Moving to non-residential and starting with heavy industrial, strong demand for large manufacturing and heavy side energy projects is expected to counterbalance ongoing moderation in warehouse and data center construction from its COVID peak. Construction spending from manufacturing in the United States continues to trend positively with the December seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $214 billion, a 61% increase from the December 2022 value of $133 billion. Manufacturing projects continue to be supported by health demand from the ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, including semiconductors and electric vehicle battery manufacturing. As an example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, Toyota announced an $8 billion expansion to their battery manufacturing campus in North Carolina, bringing their total investment to approximately $14 billion. This incremental investment solidifies North Carolina is Toyota's central hub for lithium-ion battery production in North America with this campus having over 7 million square feet. Importantly, our quarries are well-positioned to supply the aggregates needs for this type of multiyear project. Shifting to light non-residential, while demand remained resilient through 2023 despite higher interest rates, high office vacancy rates, and tighter commercial lending additions, we expect 2024 demand in this segment to moderate as it generally follows single-family residential development with a lag. Given the structural housing deficit and favorable population trends in key Martin Marietta markets, we fully expect the affordability-driven single-family residential slowdown will recover as interest rates declined further and monthly mortgage payments become relatively more affordable. Although there's still near-term uncertainty, we're encouraged by recent trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregate demand, which were 1 million units in December, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Looking ahead, we expect 2024 to be another record year for Martin Marietta. As previously mentioned, we anticipate flat aggregate shipments as infrastructure and large-scale non-residential projects should largely offset softness in the residential and light non-residential sectors. With steady product demand, supporting favorable commercial dynamics and the disciplined execution of our value over volume strategy, we expect double-digit aggregates pricing growth to overcome inflationary pressures and lead to expanded gross margins and unit profitability growth. Combined with contributions from our cement, downstream and Magnesia Specialties businesses and contributions from our recently acquired Colorado assets, we are confident in our expectations for consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.24 billion at the midpoint. To conclude, we're extremely proud of our record-setting performance in 2023. We demonstrated our ability to successfully navigate another challenging macroeconomic environment and deliver superior returns for shareholders. As we begin the new year, our teams remain committed to employee health and safety, commercial, and operational excellence, sustainable business practices, and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives as we build the safest, best-performing, and most durable aggregates-led public company. We look forward to continuing our strong momentum in driving responsible and profitable growth in 2024 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. A busy weekend, I'll tell you that. Trey, thanks a lot. I mean that's a really good question because as you recall, last year in Q1 weather was actually disproportionately good. And I think when people saw in Q1 numbers, they thought, wow, that's really something. And you know what I've long said, the first quarter can largely be made or broken by the last two weeks in March. But if you do have really challenging weather in January and February, it can put you back a little bit. So, to that end, you should expect a different cadence. I'm going to turn to Jim and ask him to give you some more detail on what that cadence is likely to look like this year. So, Jim back to you for a moment on that place. Thanks so much. Just one bit more color on that. So, obviously, January was a really challenging month for customers and everyone else as you would imagine. February, as we've seen good weather come through, the business has done what we would have thought. So, I think that's important to note as a footnote to what Jim just took you through. But Trey, thanks for the question. Stanley, thanks for the question. You're right. I mean, we've been really disciplined, very thoughtful in each of our SOAR five-year increments. So, if you go back in time and remember the first one came out in 2010, and that was through 2015. Then in 2015, we did SOAR 2020 than most recently, again, very cleverly SOAR 2025. And we've been able in each of those to effectively double our market cap and we're almost there now. And obviously, we still had some track ahead of us in SOAR 2025. I would say a couple of things. One, the commercial execution that you've seen us focused on is something that we will continue to be focused on. I think you see it in what we've given relative to our guide this year. Again, we're looking at ASP increases at 11% at the midpoint. And again, I think it's important to say, Stanley, that does not contemplate mid-years. That's the same type of conversation we had in 2023 as well. And you'll recall that we came back and actually had mid-years in more than half of our markets. So, again, we'll come back and revisit that at half year and see where that is. The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is you've seen what I think is a lot of very productive, very appropriate M&A. I think it's totally consistent with what we've sent to the market. We are an aggregates-led business. And part of what I moved by, if we look at simply what's occurred so far this year, two large transactions with assets coming into the organization, obviously, Bluewater still has some time to go through the Hart-Scott process. But we'll close on that transaction between Bluewater and what we've done without Frei & Sons, those are two pure-play aggregates businesses. And what I'm particularly moved by as well, if we look at our pipeline, that's what our pipeline looks like, too. I do believe our company is positioned from a quality growth perspective and a very compelling and it's an overused term, but I almost think unique position as well. So, will commercial discipline, be a piece of it? You bet. Will operational excellence be a piece of it? And we think it continue to be, particularly as we bring these businesses into our hold. But again, our ability to do shareholder value increasing transactions, we think here in the near-term, medium term and long-term is a fundamental differentiator for our business. And if we think about what value creation looks like for Martin Marietta and its shareholders, we think those are the key drivers. But Stanley, I hope that's helpful in response to your question. Thank you, Stanley. Good morning. So, happy to take, but I'll ask Jim to go through and give you a bucket-by-bucket view. But overall, you're entirely right. If we're just looking at general inflation, it's going to be in the mid to high single-digits range. That can obviously move around a little bit, but there are some components of our business that are seeing higher pieces of inflation. I think it's important to say that labor is actually not one of those. Those numbers continue to be in a very comfortable place, both for our workforce and for our company, but let Jim take you through some of the puts and takes on some of the other inputs. So, we hope we've been a bit punitive to ourselves. We'll see how that plays out, Anthony. Thanks so much. Well, look, if we look at the overall businesses and looking at the prior business in Colorado, they were doing somewhere between 3.5 million and 4 million tons of stone per annum. Denver is a very attractive marketplace. We'll have to see how that plays out. But you can go back over time and get a good sense of commercially at least how we've approached those markets. As you can imagine, the barriers to some degree of entry and hard rock can be quite high in a number of markets. So, we feel very good about our team in Colorado. They're very cost conscious. They're very commercially focused. And we think the marketplace in Denver will continue to be very attractive for an extended period of time. Keep in mind, if we go back -- let's call it, 13 years. We had no significant business at all in Colorado. We look up and down the Front Range today. We're the clear leader in aggregates up down the I-25 corridor. Remember, that's where 80%-plus the population in Colorado lives. And again, the biggest piece of it being in Denver. And now between the Walstrom quarry, which we picked up in our Spec AGG quarry, a very attractive position in that marketplace. If we go and look at Bluewater, obviously, that transaction has not closed. We're going through the Hart-Scott process soon and we're hoping to have that done half year-ish heavy on the ish, by the way. It could clearly push into the second half of the year. If we look at the overall tonnage, that's going to be around 13 million tons of stone. But importantly, if you look at the markets in which it gives us a nice footprint, these are markets that we've long talked about wanting to have a natural position. And so suddenly, we find ourselves in Nashville. Suddenly, we find ourselves in Knoxville. Now we find ourselves in a much more significant way in South Florida and around Miami. So, if you go back and take a look at the slide presentation that we gave to the analysts and investors in February of 2021, we talked about a series of markets that we wanted to enter when we talk about Northern California, Southern California, Arizona, in and around Austin, Texas. We talked about Middle Tennessee, we talked about South Florida, and we talked about in Northern Virginia. We are literally in a place now that we're putting checks in most of those boxes. So, again, if you take a look at the overall pricing at these facilities relative to our corporate average, it's modestly below our corporate average. So, again, I'm hoping I'm giving you something directionally that you can work with. But that gives you a sense of the market, it gives you a sense of the overall volume. I do think we will operationally bring increased efficiencies to these markets, and we're thrilled to, number one, have already brought the Frei team into the Martin Marietta fold, and we look forward to bringing the Bluewater team into our organization as well. So, hopefully answer that response to your question. You bet, Good morning Jerry. I'm wondering if we just take a step back, historically, in a flat end demand environment, the industry has realized 4 points of price or less. And obviously, we're putting up much better performance here in the price/cost spread widening. As you think about what the industry learned over the course of the hyperinflation period, I guess, do you think the fear of inflation stays with the industry beyond this year? Or could we return to slower pricing cadence in 2025 towards that historical rate? I know it's super early, but I feel like the industry got burned with inflation surprising on the upside. I'm wondering -- does that change the mindset for obviously, you folks and others in your markets? Well, Jerry, the only thing I can speak to is Martin Marietta, of course. And I would say several things. One, obviously, inflation has moved significantly over the last couple of years. And we took the actions that were smart and prudent to protect our company as that went up. Secondly, at least here in our company, we recognize that having these long-lived reserves is significant. We're sitting here today at current extraction rates with reserves in excess of 70 years. Something that I think we talk about inside our company is these reserves are worth more tomorrow than they are today. In some geographies, it's very difficult to replicate or replace the reserves. And I think as we think long term, and that's how we tend to think about this business. If we go back to one of the questions that was earlier, they were asking about SOAR and the fact that we look at our business in five-year increments. But the simple fact is, Jerry, we think about our business in terms of decades, not years, not five years, but really decades. And as we look at it through that lens, we recognize that we have the product that is absolutely essential in every form of heavy side development. You don't need asphalt in every piece of it. You don't need concrete in every piece of -- but you need the aggregates in absolutely every piece of it. So, from our perspective, as we looked at what aggregate sells for on a per ton basis and then we consider, one, its vitality to a product or to a project and its overall cost relative to the project, we think we're actually adding more to an individual project than we're costing a project. That's how we think about what we're doing. So, if we go back to the notion of will commercial excellence continue to be a driver for our organization, and I think make our pricing look fundamentally different going forward than it did, say, a decade ago Yes, I think it probably will. Do I think operationally, we will continue to bring great value to the organization by making our businesses better faster, safer, more efficient, et cetera. Yes, I think we will. But I also think that what you should expect from us, and this ties to a degree to it as well, Jerry we will continue to be a very responsible, very visionary acquirer of attractive businesses in attractive geographies. And I think if you take those building blocks that I've taken you through, it gives you a good sense of how to think about the business overall from a commercial perspective. Jerry, that's a great question. So, here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. Let's assume that Frei's closed, which it is, and let's assume the Bluewater was closed. We'd be leveraged at about 1.85 times. So, keep in mind, through a cycle, we like to be leveraged 2 times to 2.5 times. So, we're still, despite that degree of acquisitive activity, we're still below where we would typically like to be. So, my point is this, when we've seen attractive transactions before, we haven't done it a lot, but we've gone over 3 times. We've delevered actually very quickly and easily when we've done that. I continue to believe that there will be more transactional activity this year. I would be disappointed if there's not. You're right on our Q3 call back in November, I said at that time, I thought 2024 would be a pretty busy year. Obviously, we're about a month and a half into it. It's been a really busy year already. But Jerry, the fact is that I think there's going to be more, I'd be disappointed if there wasn't, and you should expect it to be more pure stone type transactions, Jerry. Thank you. Phil, thanks for your question. A couple of things that I would say. Number one, you're right. I mean, if we're looking at bringing in Frei, and let's call it, 3.5 million tons, one thing that happened in our sale of the Hunter cement plant is we're actually doing some stone production there as well that was going into the cement production. So, in fairness, that was probably about 2 million tonnes. So, really, if you start taking a look at what went the other way in the Hunter transaction, what's going this other way near-term and Frei, keep in mind that you've got a fairly seasonally impacted business in Colorado as well. Again, I think it leads you back to that relatively flattish. So, I wouldn't strain too hard on what those numbers look like because there's just enough movement on the surface of it that it could put you in a much more comfortable place you [indiscernible] booking pure flat. To your point, though, I do believe if we see interest rate reductions and we see a steady, albeit somewhat slow recovery in housing and then what's likely to be degrees of light non-res that comes behind that in the second half of the year. I'm not sure how much is going to push volumes up in half two. I think it certainly could push volumes up in half two. I think what it's really doing is it's setting up 2025 to be even a more productive year. Obviously, on the infrastructure side, we think it's going to be pretty constructive all by itself. I mean if you think about the fact that we're looking at what's happened on highway contract awards and you're looking at basic and LTM from December 2019 through 2023, that's got almost an 11% CAGR involved in it. And then we're looking at our top 10 states and DoT budgets themselves that are up on average, 10%. And here's some percentages to keep in mind. Texas, which had a really heady budget is up 24%. Florida, which has been at record levels, it's up 9%. North Carolina, our home court is up 11%. Minnesota, when we bought the business there from Tiller several years ago, we said that was a really attractive DoT, it's up about 38%. So, again, as we're looking at public, we think that that's going to be pretty compelling. Even as we sit and move to non-res, if we're looking at manufacturing, the reshoring that we mentioned in our opening comments, is pretty significant. We continue to see more activity in that space. I also called out what we're seeing consistently in energy. We got a new battery plant in Kokomo, Indiana. There's some new one coming in the Bowling Green, Kentucky. But what I've been a bit surprised by and I think this may be more geographic intensive as well or sensitive is even in the areas that have had degrees of slowing warehouses and data centers. I mean we've got four data centers under construction right now in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. And there's a new one that looks like it's coming online in Covington, Georgia. So, again, if we look across our geographic footprint and recognize that we've been very selective in the where. Do I think there's a prospect that you could see some upside in the second half of the year on volumes? Yes, I do. I think that cadence that Jim spoke to earlier, it's important to keep in mind because clearly, we're not going to have Q1 that last year. But again, I think Q2, Q3, and Q4 could be attractive, recognizing, hey, pretty heady Q4. We just had this year, too. So, again, Phil, I hope that's helpful and constructive on the volumes and what the end users look like. You bet. Tyler, you with us? Yes sir, we hear you. Hi Tyler. Hey Tyler, let me add this too because Jim nailed it. He's exactly right. The other thing that we're seeing, though, on occasion, and we've seen it more in the last few months is real estate purchases tends to be highly opportunistic. And when the right real estate shows up, you don't always know when it's going to parachute in and we have to have the ability to be pretty agile around that. So, we're looking at some real estate purchases as well that that we think will be important in the near, medium and again, long-term for Martin Marietta, but broadly very much in that range that Jim spoke to, but those are some of the moving parts, both above the water and under the water. So, I'm going to start with capital allocation, and then come back to Jim, and he can just talk you through more degrees of CapEx and how things can move around. If you think about the capital allocation, Katherine, one of the more elegant things about our company is that stays pretty consistent. Our view is our best first dollar spent is on the right transaction. And again, I think our teams are good at that. I think they're good at identifying the deals. So, I think they're good at going through the contracting process. I think they're good at the integration process. I think they're good at the synergy realization process. So, the right transactions will be number one on capital allocation, number two, and Jim will take you through more specifics, we'll be reinvesting in the business. As you know, if you're in the business of crushing stone, you're in the business of destroying iron. So, the fact is we will stay probably in those ranges that Jim spoke about a few minutes ago, but he going to more detail. And then lastly, is returning of cash to shareholders through two things; a meaningful and sustainable dividend, and we say both of those words very intentionally and share buybacks at the right time. So, the capital allocation priorities simply do not change. Now, more to your question on how does this portfolio evolution that we've seen change the way that we look at CapEx for that over to Jim. And Kathryn, let me add one more note to that as well because keep in mind, when we're doing replants or otherwise, we're doing those because the income rates of return on those projects is so compelling. We almost would feel silly if we didn't do them. At the same time, part of what's still compelling about an aggregates business is we have the capacity if we need to, and we did it in COVID, and we've done it before, to pull back on that CapEx lever. If we ever need to, we don't see a need to do that. We think we can do it very constructively. We think we can do it in a very value-additive way. But again, I think as you just step back from our industry compared to others, and you look at the degrees of agility that we can bring to something like CapEx in a heavy industry is decidedly different and we think it's advantaged Martin Marietta. So, again, we hope that's responsive to your question. Jim's got one more point. Thank you, Kathryn. Timna thank you for the question. Number one, we are starting to see that weekend to pull through. And what I would say, obviously, when you're looking at what you and I know, is a $1.2 trillion bipartisan law, that's the big amount of money. That's $110 billion to roads. It's $66 billion for railroad maintenance. It's $42 billion for port and airport infrastructure. But what's important is to start drilling down and seeing what's going on in many respects on a state-by-state or at times MSA-by-MSA basis. So, if we look at where NC DoT is, for example, their budgets up 11%. They're obviously going to see nice federal money flowing through as well. What we're basically seeing is they're increasing infrastructure funding here by $7 billion over the next decade. So, again, that starts to give you a good sense of how that money is flowing through. Texas, they're looking for FY 2024 to be another record year of lettings. That's going to be at about almost $14 billion by the way, that's up about 15% year-over-year. Their unified transportation plan for FY 2024 is expected to exceed $100 billion. Again, that's an 8% increase. So, again, the federal funds that are flowing through are a big part of that. I'm particularly moved by what we've seen happen in Florida because again, the recent Florida 2024 budget increased to $17 billion. Again, that's an all-time high, over what had been an all-time high last year. But again, as we think about what Florida is able to do because of what they're seeing from IIJA you've got the move in Florida Forward Initiative that was announced in late Q3, that's going to bring $4 billion from general revenue surplus into transportation in that state. And even as we look at what's going on in California, their recently passed FY 2024 budget includes $20.5 billion for CALTRANS and that's still a 5% year-over-year increase from FY 2023. So, if we're looking at where the states are, what they're doing with their budgets, how they're taking these funds that are also coming from the Federal government? It's a pretty compelling story, as we sit back and look at it. Jim's got a few things he wants to add as well Timna. For the right transaction, we would certainly do that, Timna. And again, we've demonstrated the capacity if we've done the right transactions to bring down leverage very, very quickly in the organization. So, we'll just have to look at them on a transaction-by-transaction basis. But the short answer is a lot of these, if they came along, you're only going to see them once. And it again can be very opportunistic and sitting at 1.85 times levered today, even having done all that we will have done this year taking into account Frei and Bluewater. We've got a lot of dry powder right now. Thank you, Timna. Good morning. Mike, thanks for the question. I mean, number one, if we look at where we're going to be after the transactions that we've done, our 2024 pro forma gross profit mix would be at 77% aggregates. I mean, should you expect that number to continue to grow? The answer is yes, you should. But I would say this, too and I think this is so important to state. The cement operation that we have in Midland Texas is a fantastic cement business. It's a long way from the Gulf of Mexico, we have our Southwest headquarters in Dallas. We're the largest aggregates producer in Dallas. We're the largest cement producer in Dallas. That business has just from my perspective, eye watering margins, we like the businesses that we have very much. And if we've got the ability, desire, and capacity to go and grow our aggregates business, which we do, and take that number that I just gave you 77% push that to 80% and then beyond that, frankly, you should expect us to do that. If we go back through the way that we've long described ourselves, we've said we're aggregates-led, with strategic cement, with targeted downstream. I mean those are, again, very well-conceived, well-thought out adjectives before each one of those businesses. And what you're seeing us to this year is totally consistent with an aggregates-led business and building a business that can outperform through cycles and we think that's so vital to what we're doing. And that's part of what's so important about also this value over volume philosophy that we're bringing to our business. So, yes, you should expect to see that aggregates number continue to go up. And again, that's very consistent with the pipeline that we're looking at today. Keith are you there? Now, we hear you Keith. Yes sir. No, Garik, it's a fair question. The conversations have actually been pretty constructive with our customers. And keep in mind, several things happen. Number one, location is going to matter a lot. Number two, relationship is going to matter a lot. Number three, I think the swing factor in some places may be what degrees of midyears declined. Again, the only place right now that we've already got stated midyears are in California, where we told people basically we're coming out of the gate in 2024 were $2 a ton up, and then we're going to do another $2 a ton at midyear. Keep in mind, too, that most of our customers are not the owner. They tend to be a general first-year tier sub, second tier sub, third tier sub, et cetera. and they tend to be cost-plus themselves. And if we're looking at being 10% of the cost of a road, 2% of the cost of a home, and somewhere between those two numbers on a non-res project. The price of the stone usually isn't why a project goes or why a contractor gets the job. But at the same time, we're placing that stone once it goes out of our gate can be pretty challenging. So, look, do I think -- do I think we will see years and years of price performance like we saw in 2023? No, I don't think that's going to be the norm. Do I think we're trending more towards -- but I think the norm will be from Martin Marietta this year? Yes, I think we probably are. And to me, that feels like an appropriate place for us to be given the economy, given the difficulties that you can have in replacing some of these reserves in some of these key markets. Remember, we have some urban quarries and locations that trying to find opportunities to come back behind quarries if they're depleted would be hugely challenging. And building new cars will put you further away from the city centers and take degrees of efficiency away. So, again, I hope that gives you, number one, a philosophy on how we approach it. Number two, what our dialogue looks like with our customers and number three, how I think it's going to play out, at least from Martin Marietta over a period of years. Thanks so much Garik. Hi Joe. Yes, happy to. I mean here's a good way to think of it, and this is not a bad laboratory to give it some thoughts. So, if we look in Q2, volume is down 2%. So, last year, we were at 47.7%. The year just ended 46.6%. If we're really looking at that and saying, what were your swing markets or what are you swing factors? Value over volume was probably modestly over 1 million tons of that. So, again, if we think -- what we actually had a better return for shareholders. We kept those reserves in the ground or we kept them in stockpiles. We'll sell them another day, we'll sell them for higher. And that was your primary driver, there was some degrees as well chronicle of market softening in degrees of residential and non-res, but the biggest piece of that was value over volume. So, if we're looking at what swing factors can be, as Jim pointed out, in the quarter, we saw infrastructure volumes up 6%, that wasn't a surprise, but really it was a nice affirmation of what's happening. So, if we continue to see public grow sensibly, if we see res start to do, but we're not predicting it, but you can certainly see that res could have a nice recovery beginning in half two. We think that's important. And again, as we're looking at these mega projects, if we're looking at non-res projects of size and of scale. Depending on how some of those play out, it doesn't take a lot of those. I mean it could take one or two of those to really change the trajectory of degrees of volume. And obviously, we're still having significant conversations on a number of large non-res projects in the Gulf of Mexico and if some of those go -- I think those are your swing factors, Joe, as you think about volumes. So, I hope that helped. You bet. Take care. Thank you so much Adam. Good to hear your voice. Well, I'm not sure it was so much -- I was talking more broadly about what some of the writers have said. I think what I was saying is, in our world, it hasn't been as down as people would have thought. Now, keep in mind, it was against a really tough comp. So, that's more other than anything else. But if you just look at general trade publications, they're going to say, look, in warehousing and data center, you're going to start to see some moderation simply because the comps were so high. I guess my point was not all markets are going to be equal. And I think when we start looking at the Southeastern, Southwestern and interestingly, these Midwestern markets, where there's a lot of data center activity, which was why I was calling out, in particular, part of what's happening in Nebraska and Iowa because those have been actually really resilient markets in that particular space, Adam. So, it was something I was really calling up high degrees of weakness. It was more comps are tough and the overall commentary around that is a little bit softer than in some other areas. But again, I think we're holding up better than most. Yes, I think -- look, I think if we're talking about that in innings, I mean we're in the very early innings of that. I mean, I think as a practical matter, 2024 is really the first year that we're going to start to see significant stone go out the gate on IIJA. So, here's the way I would think of it, Adam. 2024 on that is going to be better than 2023. 2025 is likely to be better than 2024, and I think 2026 could be better than 2025. So, in baseball parlance, we're not anywhere near the seventh inning stretch. I mean we're in a very healthy spot right now, and it's likely to be that way for a number of years. Thank you, Adam. Again, thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's impressive 2023 results underscore the durability and resiliency of our aggregate flood business in unparalleled markets and the efficacy of our value over volume market approach. This solid foundation together with our unyielding commitment to enterprise excellence through the execution of our strategic priorities gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering industry-leading safe, financial and operational performance. With our attractive underlying fundamentals, proven strategic priorities and best-in-class teams, we're excited about our prospects for continued sustainable growth and value creation for our shareholders for the foreseeable future. We look forward to sharing our first quarter 2024 results in the spring. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward and good morning everyone. As Ward mentioned, we completed the sale of our South Texas Cement plant and related concrete operations last week on February 9th. While these businesses were classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of December 31st, revenues and profits from these operations through the divestiture date are included in the earnings from continuing operations. Accordingly, the revenues and profits from these assets are included in both 2023 as reported earnings from continuing operations and in our 2024 earnings guidance through the February 9th close date. The revenues and profits from the Colorado assets acquired on January 12th, 2024, also are included in our forward earnings guidance. Lastly, the Bluewater Industries transaction has not yet closed and remain subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review. Accordingly, the contributions from the pending acquisitions are not included in our 2024 earnings guidance. That said, we will provide updated earnings guidance after closing Bluewater transaction, which is expected to occur later this year. The Building Materials business posted full year 2023 revenues of $6.5 billion, an increase of 10.3% and gross profit of $1.9 billion, a notable 43.7% increase year-over-year, both new records. The aggregates business achieved all-time record revenues in 2023, growing 10.9% to $4.3 billion. Gross profit increased 40.1% to $1.4 billion, and gross margin increased 660 basis points to 32%. Again, both all-time records. Solid pricing growth more than offset lower shipments, further demonstrating how the disciplined execution of our value over volume, commercial strategy yields, higher profits and higher margins even without the benefit of growing volumes. Our Texas Cement business extended its track record of outstanding performance and once again delivered record top and bottom-line results. Revenues increased 17% to $725.5 million and gross profit increased 64.6% to $333.6 million, driven primarily by favorable supply/demand dynamics in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and energy cost tailwinds. As a reminder, the new finish mill at our Midlothian, Texas plant in North Texas is expected to be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024, adding approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high margin annual production capacity. Moving to our targeted downstream businesses. Our concrete revenues increased 5.9% to $1 billion and gross profit increased 44.2% to $102 million, driven primarily by pricing gains and mega project contributions, which more than offset higher upstream, raw material, and delivery costs. Asphalt and paving revenues increased 12.6% to $887.1 million. Gross profit increased 34.7% to $109 million. The result of strong demand and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties full year revenues increased 3.8% to $315.4 million, while gross profit increased 6.9% to $97.1 million. Strong pricing and energy cost tailwinds more than offset weaker demand in certain magnesia end markets, including TPO roofing and cobalt mining. We continue to balance our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities to responsibly grow our business. In 2023, we invested $650 million of capital into our business and returned $324 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and share repurchases. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February of 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.4 times as of December 31st, assuming the Albert Frei & Sons and Bluewater Industries' acquisitions and South Texas Cement and related concrete operations divestiture were effective as of January 1st, 2024, after giving effect to the impacts of these transactions, our net debt to EBITDA ratio would have been 1.85 times, just below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, which would provide ample dry powder to take advantage of additional value-enhancing acquisitions. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward to discuss end market trends. Yes, sure. Happy to do that. So, we've closed now on two transactions, the acquisition of Al Frei, that is in -- and that -- you can think about that maybe between $40 million and $45 million of EBITDA coming from that business. And then we've also closed the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and ready-mix business. And you can think about that as around $170 million of EBITDA that was divested. So, those are coming out of what you would have seen from the 2023 view. The Bluewater acquisition, call it, $135 or so million of EBITDA that is not -- that would be a full year run rate view that is not included in our guide. We will, of course, include that -- when that closes, we'll update our guidance for that additional EBITDA at that point. But hopefully, that provides the necessary ins and outs for you to make that work. Yes. So, Q1 2023, as Ward mentioned, was unseasonably good. That year, Q1 represented 15% of our gross profit. I'm speaking on a consolidated basis, so it's not a product-by-product. But on a consolidated basis, 15% of gross profits were earned in Q1. Again, it's a lower -- EBIT lower profit quarter. So, small changes can have big percentage impacts. And then pointing out, as you did the weather this year is worse in Q1. I'm now going to guess around 11.5% of our gross profits that occurred in Q1 of this year. So, that's about a 350 basis point drop. I would say with Q2, Q3, and Q4 would each be about a little bit more than 1 percentage points increasing versus what they were last year. Again, that's percentages of total yearly profits. Does that help? Yes, you're right. It's about 7% inflation on the COGS -- on the aggregates business, COGS per ton. So, here are the items that are above 7% or north of 7%. Oil lubricants, we're expecting to be up quite a bit explosive, still remain high. The parts and equipment for the plants, also about the ZIP code. So, those are the areas that are pushing it above 7%, areas that are pushing it below 7 are, as Ward mentioned, labor, which is our biggest cost component and also diesel and electricity, nat gas. Those are not expected to be headwinds in 2024. So, those are the large buckets, I would say, that are deviating from the 7%, some are more than 7%, others are well below the 7%. But on a blended basis, that's where we're ending up. There's a smidge of a headwind in for diesel, not much off of current spot prices. Yes, good question. Our range is between 8% to 10%, typically, 9% is the most common at the midpoint. But we do have a couple of large projects in there. And you're right, the finished mill seven is among those that's one of the larger spends in 2024 as we wrap up that project. Another one is our Beckman plant in San Antonio is getting a significant upgrade there as well. So, the largest items that are helping to push that up to a little bit more than normal, but still well within the range of what I think is typical for us. Yes. So, I would expect it to go either be very constant with historical levels or maybe a little bit higher as we as we look to replant many of our aggregate plants to keep them efficient and highly automated. So, as far as cadence for the year, I would expect it to be similar to last year and the year before Q1 and Q4 a little bit heavier on the CapEx, Q2 and Q3 a little bit lighter. But of course, the things that can throw that out of whack -- on occasion would be the occasional opportunistic generation of land purchase. That would be something that could, of course, grow those percentages and historical patterns out of kilter. But hopefully, that answers the question, Kathy. One more point kind of an overall cash perspective, Kathryn. So, our operating cash flow grew tremendously this year. I'm comparing year-over-year now. Our CapEx did grow, but our cash conversion ratio improved in 2023 over 2022 meaningfully. So, we're very mindful of our cash flow. We think it's good and getting better even with slightly higher CapEx in 2024. We think that trend will continue. Sure. Yes. It's actually, it's net interest expense. So, it's gross interest expense of, call it, $160 million interest income of, call it, $100 million. So, net interest expense of about $60 million at the midpoint. Yes. Our volumes were down 2% for the quarter, but I'll point out our infrastructure volumes were actually up 6%. So, we think those are -- we're seeing it's coming through those infrastructure volumes. I'll give you some of that, Keith. It's getting increasingly challenging for us to give too much granularity around that cement business. because that's the only cement business that we have. So, I'm torn between -- I want to make sure I'm transparent giving you everything that you need. I also don't want to put ourselves at a remarkable competitive disadvantage. So, I'll give you an overall sense -- obviously-- I'll give you what I can with that -- so look, we obviously kept the larger of the two cement businesses. From a volume perspective, it's going to be modestly over two million tons. From a pricing perspective, we're looking at an increase in North Texas of around $15 per ton. That increase -- if I were you, I'd be modeling that more in an April timeframe as opposed to a January timeframe. Obviously, you saw very attractive margins in that business last year. And what I would suggest to you is our aim would be on a full year basis to maintain the types of margins in that business that you saw in the overall cement business last year in Texas. So, Keith, I hope that gives you broadly what you need. You bet. No, I don't think so. To the extent -- I mean we're going to be very disciplined about bringing that online. It won't be disruptive to price. We think we'll be able to bring it online gradually in terms of operational approach as well as marketplace impact. It will be very disciplined, and we think it won't be very disruptive at all. So, we're not looking for any kind of noticeable effect from external view on this point. And margins should be enhanced when those come online. So we think it's really going to fit the market is sold out by and large, and we think it will fit nicely with the growing demand there."

Martin Marietta once again delivered record results across nearly every financial and operational measure extending our long track record of industry-leading performance and responsible profitable growth. Thanks to the dedication of our colleagues across the enterprise, we achieved accompanying milestone by exceeding $2 billion in trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA for the first time. Our exceptional third quarter is highlighted by a 42% improvement in aggregates gross profit per ton despite lower shipments further validating the benefits of our value over volume commercial strategy and our commitment to operating with excellence, while meeting and exceeding our customers' needs. Importantly, while our work in continuous safety improvement is never done, I'm proud to report the company concluded our safest third quarter on record with total and lost time incident rates surpassing world-class levels. On another third quarter event it's notable that just yesterday on October 31 we finalized the sale of our Tehachapi California Cement plant substantially completing the planned asset sales from the 2021 Lehigh Hanson West acquisition. Consistent with our SOAR 2025 initiatives, this divestiture of a non-strategic asset provides us with additional balance sheet flexibility to advance our well-articulated path of quality aggregates-led growth. As detailed in today's earnings release, we raised our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, as pricing momentum will more than offset lower shipments and recently increased energy and related costs. Turning now to Martin Marietta's third quarter financial performance. We established all-time quarterly records across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $2 billion, a 10.1% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $676 million, a 38.6% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.94 of 48.6% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $705.2 million, a 32.3% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $7.89 of 42.4% increase. These results reinforce the durability of our aggregates-led business, which is strategically situated in well-curated geographies. These record results also reflect our team's focus on what we can control, despite heightened geopolitical tensions and persistent macroeconomic headwinds, including growth restrictive monetary policy and continued inflation. Shifting now to our third quarter shipment and pricing results. Aggregate shipments declined 7.3%. Our value over volume strategy is clearly an unapologetic component of that result, as a softening demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, which was partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive with pricing increasing 20% or 17.2% on a mix adjusted basis, as we continue to expect fair value for our depleting resources. Near sold-out Texas cement conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, continue to drive strong product demand in a favorable commercial environment. Third quarter cement shipments of 1.1 million tons were flat to last year's comparable period and pricing grew 18.9%, as we continue to largely sell as much as we can produce. We expect favorable Texas Cement pricing dynamics will continue and accordingly announced a $15 per ton price increase effective January 1. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3.6%, while pricing improved a solid 20.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 5.7% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing our outlook for the remainder of 2023 and a preliminary view of 2024, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good morning, everyone. The Building Materials business posted record quarterly revenue of $1.92 billion, a 10.5% increase over last year's third quarter and record quarterly gross profit of $649.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 38.4%. Aggregates gross profit improved to 32.1% relative to the prior year period to a record $440.6 million, as pricing growth more than offset lower shipments and higher production costs, underscoring the strength and effectiveness of our value-over-volume commercial strategy, as a distinguishing hallmark to grow profitability through economic cycles. The business also achieved an aggregate gross profit margin of 36.2%, setting a new all-time profitability record despite the shipment decline. Our Texas Cement business also extended its track record of outstanding performance. Revenues increased 18.3% to $199.1 million, while gross profit increased 61.5% to $108.7 million. Pricing growth and lower energy costs, more than offset higher raw materials and maintenance costs. Domestic production capacity constraints and robust demand continue to drive extremely tight supply particularly in North Texas. As a reminder, Martin Marietta has taken two notable steps to increase our Texas Cement production capacity to capitalize on the supply-demand dynamics. First, we've homely converted our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement also known as Type 1L, at both our Midlothian and Hunter Texas plants. This conversion not only reduces our carbon footprint, but also expanded our production capacity by approximately 10%. Second, our Midlothian Texas plant is installing a new finish mill, providing 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity. This project should be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024. As previously discussed, we began utilizing the new silos to low customer trucks in July. In addition to increasing cement storage capacity by over 60%, these silos have considerably enhanced the customer experience by reducing lot cycle times and are saving our customers up to an hour at peak shipping times each day. Our concrete revenues increased 25.3% to $285.2 million and gross profit increased 81.8% to $34.1 million, driven primarily by steady volume growth pricing gains and mega project contributions which more than offset higher upstream raw material and delivery costs. Our asphalt and paying revenues increased 14.6% on $359.9 million and gross profit increased 33% to $66.1 million, reflecting higher selling prices and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $75.5 million in the third quarter in line with the prior period and gross profit increased 3.6% to $21.4 million, softening demand in certain Magnesia end markets including TPO roofing and metal lining was more than offset by commercial and operational excellence initiatives and energy tailwinds. We expect demand to soften due to labor unrest in the automotive sector and Magnesia end-markets remaining weak in the fourth quarter and as such have reduced our Magnesia Specialties full year gross profit guidance. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase to our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, demonstrating its confidence in the durability and sustainability of our company's future growth and free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.96. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times as of September 30th, representing balance sheet strength and flexibility to responsibly grow through quality acquisitions and prudent capital investments, while returning capital to Martin Marietta to shareholders. To conclude my prepared remarks, I want to emphasize that the record-breaking financial performance of this quarter and year-to-date has demonstrated a disciplined execution of our value over volume commercial strategy yields higher margins, higher profits and higher cash flow without the benefit of growing volumes. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2024, we remain confident Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals across our coast-to-coast footprint, specifically infrastructure demand from increased federal and state level investments and heavy industrial projects of scale should counterbalance headwinds in the light nonresidential and historically underbuilt residential sectors, which are more sensitive to tightening credit conditions and higher for longer interest rate expectations. In the third quarter, infrastructure accounted for 39% of total shipments, predictably building to a higher and more normalized portion of our overall business. The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand is meaningfully higher year-over-year. These infrastructure contract awards grew 18% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period, ending September 30, 2023. Collectively, we anticipate that the historic increase in public sector investment from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, record state departments of transportation budgets and voter-approved state and local transportation ballot initiatives will provide sustained multiyear demand to this aggregates intensive often countercyclical end market. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 33% of our third quarter shipments. Heavy side energy and manufacturing projects of scale continue to drive demand in this segment, as warehouse and data center construction continues to moderate from the post-COVID period. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States continues to trend favorably with the August season adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $198 billion at 66% increase from the August 2022 value of $120 billion. The Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS act together with significant private investments, provide funding certainty for these large-scale manufacturing and energy projects that we believe will be disproportionately and positively impactful in Martin Marietta markets. Importantly, we have both the ability and capacity to supply these large projects and with the successful execution of our commercial and operational excellence strategies will do so in a manner that is margin accretive. Moving to white non-residential, while third quarter shipments remained resilient, we expect the recent interest rate acceleration together with tighter commercial lending conditions may impact future demand. That said, the anticipated softness in this segment should be partially offset by the extended cycle and strength of the more aggregates intensive heavy nonresidential sector. Softening in the residential end market, which accounted for 23% of aggregate shipments this quarter, is expected to continue, driven by current mortgage rates which are nearing 23-year highs at 8%. While single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregates demand signaled a near-term bottom and inflection point over the summer, the current higher rates are exacerbating affordability challenges and driving our revised expectations of soft demand in this end market. Nonetheless, we fully expect this current single-family housing slowdown will reverse once home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium, as demand far exceeds supply across key Martin Marietta markets, the result of significant underbuilding over the last decade and homeowners' reluctance to abandon low-rate mortgages. As we look to 2024, our preliminary view anticipates aggregate shipments will be effectively flat as increased infrastructure investment coupled with robust activity from heavy non-residential projects of scale should help balance expected softness in interest rate sensitive private construction end markets. We remain confident that favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy will be supported by 2023 exit rates as well as the realization of our previously announced January 1, 2024 price increases. Together, we expect this will drive low-double-digit growth in aggregates pricing and another year of profitable growth in 2024. To conclude, our team achieved impressive results in nearly every aspect of our business against a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. One of Martin Marietta enduring qualities is our proven ability to adapt quickly and respond effectively and durably to changing circumstances. Accordingly, we are extremely proud of our company's exceptional safety, operational and financial performance through the first nine months of 2023. Moreover, our record-setting third quarter performance, together with our fourth quarter expectations, reinforce our confidence that we will deliver our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $2.1 billion on organic improvement of $500 million or 31% over 2022. Through the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, we intend to continue driving responsible and profitable growth in 2023 and into the future. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi. Thank you for taking my question today. Just following-up on the value over volume is clearly is showing through with the pricing performance this quarter and throughout the year. But it can have an impact on relative market share, because it's principally you're willing to give up some volume and for secure pricing. So could you discuss how it's working and speaks to what it means to relative market share and how it affects your business not just only now but a bigger picture over the next several years? Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet. Kathryn thanks for the question. So, several things. Can it affect degrees of tonnage going out the gate? Yes, it can. So if we're looking at the tonnage down this quarter versus the prior year quarter probably a little bit less than half of that was due to value over volume. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. We've got depleting reserves. That said, on average, we've got 70 years of reserves at current extraction rates. So we've got a long-lived business. But we know the reserves are worth more in the ground tomorrow than they are today. And if we're looking at really where we're seeding some share on, it tends to be lower-margin products. In other words things like base and fines. So part of what we're trying to do is we're talking with our customers to make sure that they understand really twice a year is something that we're looking at on revisiting our pricing. The other thing that's important to keep in mind relative to aggregates, and this is different from some other functions as well. It doesn't have to be a 24/7 business. In fact, in most of our locations, it's not and where you've got 24/7 businesses incremental volume can give a high degree of operating leverage. That's just not something with which we're encumbered, in aggregate. So we shut down each evening, and open up each morning and that gives us an enormous amount of flexibility. And then probably most importantly, Kathryn, when the volume does come back and by the way it typically does. It typically comes back at higher pricing. So, you can see the math. I mean the value over volume strategy works, it protects our reserves. It protects the longevity of our business. And it's something that we've been very clear, with our team is important to us and part of what you can see in the numbers is, that it's coming through. So, I hope that's responsive, Kathryn. Thank you for the question.\nKathryn Thompson: Yes. And just one quick follow-up with the sale of the California Cement asset, do you speak to just general state of your Texas Cement operations our inventories relative to demand? Have you seen any changes? Just to kind of that business, as you plan for next year.\nWard Nye: Thanks for the question. As you know, when we went into cement in Texas, we said, we view that as a strategic cement business. And my prepared comments said, we sold a non-strategic asset in California. And we set strategic cement for set where we're an aggregates leader, where the market is naturally vertically integrated where we have a downstream business taking a significant portion of it in Texas it's about 30%, and where it cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water. Our Texas Cement business is very solid. And part of the reason on it is, it's in Dallas-Fort Worth and it's in San Antonio. So, it removed from the vicissitude of imports largely. So what we're seeing in that marketplace and what you saw in the quarter, is volumes were largely flat because we're broadly sold out. And we continue to largely sell, what we're producing. And part of what we're anticipating and part of what we've announced, is a $15 a ton price increase for cement effective January 1. So, I think that -- those data points give you, a good snapshot of where Texas Cement is today.\nKathryn Thompson: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nTrey Grooms: Thanks and good morning.\nWard Nye: Hi, Trey.\nTrey Grooms: So, maybe sticking to the pricing theme here particularly in aggregates. If you could maybe talk through your initial 2024 aggregates pricing outlook of low double digits growth that you've laid out, and maybe unpack how much you have coming from carryover 2023 midyear increases, and how you're setting the stage for low double digits price improvement in 2024?\nWard Nye: Happy to try. Thanks for that. So we're thinking about the 2024 guide, similar to the way that we did the 2023 guide. What I mean by that, is the guide that we've given I think this is more to stay out immediately, does not include any midyears and again, just as we saw in 2023, we think we're going to have mid-years in 2024. But right now, the guide that we've given, does not assume that. So, I think that's important. Secondly, as I indicated in the previous question, we think midyears are becoming more and more the norm, with our customers and we think the expectations have been set, the customer letters that have gone out indicate that pricing is largely effective from January 1 to June 30. So in the correspondence that has already gone, people know that we're going to protect them through midyear. Now, in fairness there's a footnote to that. And the notable exception is California, where our pricing letters already include announced midyear so that our customers can plan for that in that marketplace. We've long talked about what we inherited when we bought the business in California and we're trying to address that. Just to be clear, California totaled 2024 increases right now look like that's going to be about $4 a ton across all products and markets, as we continue to implement that strategy in particular in what's a relatively new marketplace for Martin Marietta. Now to your point, if we're thinking about the way carryovers are going to work carryovers next year are probably going to be in the low single-digits so a little bit lower than they were this year. But again, we've got a lot of confidence in what we think we will come out with on January 1. And then, again, if we have something that even begins to replicate what we saw in midyear next year and frankly there's probably some upside to that Trey. So I think that gives you a good build on the way that we see that working based off exit rates in 2023.\nTrey Grooms: Yeah. Super helpful Ward. Thank you so much and good luck.\nWard Nye: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nStanley Elliott: Hey, good morning, everyone and congratulations. Can you guys talk about what you guys are seeing on the M&A front? I mean, historically, you've done a nice job strategically expanding the footprint. Leverage the 18% free cash flow cement sale even better by year-end. What is the M&A market looking like these days?\nWard Nye: Stanley, thanks for the question and for the comments on the quarter. The M&A market is actually looking increasingly attractive. The level of dialogue has ramped up in the second half of this year. From my perspective, that wasn't a tremendous surprise. As you know, 2021 was a big year for M&A for us. And part of what we've been doing, since then is a lot of what you saw in today's announcement relative to the sale of Tehachapi, making sure we're getting our pricing right in different markets making sure we're getting our hands around the operations. And now, as we sit here today, several things are apparent. Number one, we're looking at a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. So that's below our targeted range. Two, you can see from the financials what the cash flow in this organization looks like that can clearly help fuel and will fuel some aggregates led frankly from my perspective pure aggregate transactions. And then two or three, when we had the proceeds that have just come in from Tehachapi, it puts us in a very attractive place. Do I think we'll have anything to announce here in the rest of this year? Probably not. Do I hope that we'll have some things that we can announce early next year? I think that we will. So, more to come on that Stanley. But again, we like financially where we're sitting. We like strategically where we're sitting. We like what we believe or what we know we can do from a regulatory perspective because we think that's a differentiator right now. So we believe that we can continue to give you price. We believe we can continue to give you really good cost control. And we believe we can keep giving you good solid attractive M&A. And we think that's a hattrick that we can offer today.\nStanley Elliott: Great. Thanks so much and best of luck.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Stanley.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nWard Nye: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Hi. Just pulling together what you shared in your preliminary comments double-digit pricing growth, flat volumes, embedding call it high single-digit COGS per unit growth. I mean, that essentially gets you to roughly $200 million of aggregate profit growth 2024 versus 2023 which is I think probably consistent with the consensus growth expectations for total company EBITDA 2024 versus 2023. So I know you're not providing your full 2024 outlook here, but it does feel like you're giving us the pieces to get the consensus EBITDA numbers with probably higher profitability and lower volumes than what folks expected on a bottom on basis. Is that fair? And any other puts and takes that you would add?\nWard Nye: Yes, I think, that's relatively fair. And if you think about it Jerry I think that's what we did in Q2 and I think that's what we've done in Q3. I mean I think part of what you're seeing is the world can go through different degrees of economic turmoil and this is a business that continues to be very steady very durable in all forms of markets. So I don't disagree at all. I'll turn it over to Jim in just a moment so he can add if there are any particular things that he wants to make sure he calls out. But one of the things that I think is worth noting Jerry, I mean, did energy help us this quarter? Absolutely it did. But I think part of what's so striking to me is even if we did not have the energy tailwind that we did this quarter we would have set new records this quarter anyway. And I think it's so important because I know what you're looking for those puts and takes I wanted to go ahead and address that one upfront because, while in the quarter that was powerful. It would have been a very powerful quarter even without that. Jim anything you want to add?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. No it's just that the cost inflation continues to moderate slightly still elevated compared to historical levels. But again as we've demonstrated this year, we expect it to happen next year pricing growth exceeds cost inflation. So we do expect margins to expand next year.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I just follow-up the downstream businesses you folks are executing really well this year how much of that has been because of a helpful move in diesel and liquid asphalt versus what's sustainable in the new portfolio particularly on the ready-mix side post the divestiture?\nWard Nye: Yes, Jerry, thanks for the question. I would say several things. One if you think about our ready-mix business it's almost uniquely in Texas and Arizona. And those are two very good markets. And one reason that they're good is look you're in New York if you look at your window you're going to see asphalt streets and when you get to the bridges you'll have concrete bridges. If you're in Texas you're writing on concrete roads and concrete bridges and you're building things structurally with concrete as well. So those markets tend to be more durable from a supply perspective because again you've got that really non-cyclical or often countercyclical infrastructure market that will place some meaningfully in in our ready-mix business. And clearly ASP was up 20% in ready-mix. That helped a lot but frankly volume was up very modestly. And again Texas is 80% of our volume in ready-mix. Now alternatively, if you go to HMA give you a sense of that's going to be full year probably about nine million tons. So it's a fairly notable business. Now practically speaking, it's in three places. It's in Minnesota, it's up and down the Rocky Mountains and it's in California. And what we saw there was ASP was up 6.7% because liquid wasn't moving as much. But the fact was Q3 was an all-time record of almost 3.9 million tons for us in asphalt. And keep in mind asphalt's going to be about 95% crushed down. So from our perspective that's a very attractive business, particularly, in Minnesota where as you recall Jerry it's largely an FOB business. So it's truly a material business for us there. And of that nine million tons, Minnesota is going to be a little bit over $3 million of it. So at least those are the quick puts and takes that we've got on that. Jim anything you want to add on that?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. I mean, obviously, the bitumen pricing costs did help the asphalt pay business. improve margins. It wasn't wholly due to that of course. But on the ready mixed side I would say was very, very little additive from the lower energy costs. So hopefully that answers the question too just rounding out what Ward provided.\nJerry Revich: It does. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jerry and take care.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Pettinari: Good morning.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hey. Ward, you talked about some softness in ag in the quarter in the Southwest and the Midwest, if I heard that right. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. Was that weather driven or maybe a specific end market? Just wondering if there's any carryover into 4Q or potential reads into 2024?\nWard Nye: Thanks for the question. We had a couple of things. One in the Southwest, frankly, you had a lot of heat and the heat slowed some things down and you also had some timing relative to the large energy projects as well. So I see a lot of that being pushed off to the right. I mean clearly and it's not just the Southwest or Midwest issue. There are some degrees of softening relative to warehousing and data centers. I mean that's not a surprise. We anticipated that. But what we are seeing is a nice renaissance relative to manufacturing and then the timing of energy coming. Energy is not one of those issues that we have any concerns about. It's just relative to pace. So I think more than anything we had degrees of timing and we had certain degrees of softness that, from my perspective were broadly anticipated. And I think that's one of the reasons that when we were giving you our results at half year, part of what we indicated to you, is we thought we would probably see a near-term nature in volumes in the third quarter. So if we're looking at the way Q3 worked from our perspective Anthony, honestly, no big surprises including the way the pull-through came through and some -- obviously some very attractive incrementals in the quarter.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPhil Ng: Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. And obviously, your price -- your value over volume approach is showing in your results. But I'm just curious how much line of sight do you have on your aggregate pricing in 2024? How are your competitors behaving in this environment? Is that value over volume approach potentially at risk tier volumes? The reason why I ask is because one of your bigger competitors calling for perhaps weaker volumes than your flattish outlook. So I just want to understand how the competitive landscape is behaving on pricing?\nWard Nye: Well, the things that we stay focused on Phil is what can we control and how do we run our business and we do that based on what our needs are. So we're very focused on Martin Marietta. We're focused on where operations are we're focused on what our inventories look like. We're focused on what our reserves look like in the ground. And we're focused on what we feel like the market can bear relative to these products. So our perspective, those are really the unique drivers on that. As I indicated before, if you're looking at volumes for the quarter were our volumes down a little bit more than others yes probably, so are we okay with that? You bet. Do I feel like that's probably going to find more degrees of equilibrium going forward? I think it probably will. At the same time, if I'm looking at the geographies in which we tend to be focused, let's face it we're talking about Texas, that's going to be awfully good. I mean we're looking at a Texton budget for FY 2024 that it exceeds $18.5 billion. I mean that's just a massive budget in Colorado, recently passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill, that's going to be massive in that state here in North Carolina and it was something that I'm proud to have been part of the project. We structurally change the way that we're paying for infrastructure here. Now we're using a degree of sales taxes. And in FY 2024, it's going to ramp up to 4% here in North Carolina, because North Carolina recognized they needed to increase their spending by over $7 billion over the next decade. But even separate distinct from that, if we're looking in Florida right now, Florida is looking at a $17.2 billion budget for FY 2024 and that's an all-time record. And I feel like I've said for probably the last six or seven years, that every year is an all-time record for transportation in Florida, largely because it has been. And in California where we brought that new business the Caltrans budget is $20.5 billion next year. Now to give you a sense of it, that's a 5.5% or 5.6% year-over-year increase with $12.1 billion designated for highway and bridge capital spending. So as we're thinking about what that public funding looks like and we're coming back and looking at what's happening industrially in places like Atlanta what's going on in South Georgia, literally just yesterday, Toyota announced they're adding $8 billion to what is already a large battery plant that's underway in Randolph County that's just downside of Greensboro. These are the types of things that we're seeing in our markets both in public and heavy non-res that gives us a lot of confidence around the way that we think volumes will work next year. And the fact is with the footprint that we have, I don't have any doubt that we're going to get our fair share of that business. I just want to make sure that we're doing for what we feel like is fair value for that business.\nPhil Ng: Super. And Ward, you mentioned maybe some of the weakness recently is tied to some of these bigger projects whether its energy mega products, getting pushed out. Can you give us a little perspective when you see that kind of ramping up? Is that early next year middle part of next year? And then on the public infrastructure side, we could all appreciate there's a lot of money coming. How do you kind of see that ramping up and building into 2024?\nWard Nye: Yeah. Phil, those are great questions. I think on the public infrastructure side, we're still where we were. We said, we thought we would start to see that building in for and then build into 2024 -- when I say four, I mean Q4 of this year. And that was part of what led us to the commentary around the fact that we thought we'd probably see this type of dip in Q3. So again very anticipated, if we're looking for example at the large LNG projects, part of what we're seeing right now is several projects that are already underway. Golden Pass is underway, Chevron Phillips has a large facility in Orange, Texas that's underway, Port Arthur LNG, at least portions of that are underway, Cheniere has a lot this underway. But if we look going forward, I can think of at least four big jobs and I think this gives you a sense from a timing perspective in Texas that we're watching. Cheniere has another one in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. We are grand LNG in Brownsville and Freeport LNG in Texas, all are looking at we believe 2024 start dates. We're actually anticipating some acceptance of materials maybe as soon as this week on some of those projects. So it continues to be a live conversation. So if we think about it for the year has timing been a little bit of a headwind on those, yeah, it has. Do we think they're going away? Absolutely not. And part of what we're seeing and frankly in degrees this is helpful, you've got degrees of material tightness in some of those markets and that continues to underscore at least the notion of the overall economy in Texas today. So I hope that gives you a snapshot at least on some of the heavy non-recipe.\nPhil Ng: Appreciate the great color.\nWard Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Hey good morning everyone.\nWard Nye: Hi Timna.\nTimna Tanners: I want to follow up on one would just appreciate that...\nWard Nye: Timna, I'm sorry to interrupt you. We're having a hard time hearing you. Can you lean that a little bit more please?\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Is that better?\nWard Nye: Yes ma'am, it is. Thank you.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Sorry about that. So I appreciate the commentary on big projects and starting up in 2024. We have heard some delays and cost overruns. So does that affecting your geographies perhaps as much? Or are you budgeting for that as well?\nWard Nye: I don't think, they're affecting number one our geographies that much and two, to the extent that inflation or varying degrees of it continues to go through. Frankly, if we can keep up with that or stay ahead of it Timna, it's actually been an ally to our business, not an enemy to our business. So I do think if we had a strikingly different geographic profile then we have, I would probably feel differently about it than I do. But if we go back to that conversation I was having just a little while ago relative to our leading states and the degree of both public and private activity that we're seeing in Texas and Colorado and the Carolinas and Georgia and Florida. Those are very powerful steady markets right now. And I'm even taken to by the continued resiliency in markets like Indiana and in Iowa as well. Iowa is a state that has been very steady all the way through cycles for us including probably the single most steady market in which we participated during the great financial crisis. So, I just call that out, because it's one of those states that doesn't come to mind immediately, if you're in New York or Chicago or Dallas or Los Angeles thinking about this industry. But it's been one that for us that's been actually quite important and very durable.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Helpful. And then just on the commentary on M&A. I know in the past you would have hoped to have some done by the end of this year now talking about next year. Is that just a timing issue? Or is there anything that you can share there?\nWard Nye: It's more of a timing issue than anything else, Timna. Obviously, you know what the process looks like. You're going to have dialogue with a potential company you want to acquire, you'll go through a valuation process, you might go through a letter of intent contracting and then you also have regulatory processes that you have to go through. And none of that's easy, but our team is essentially very good at it, but we're going to be thoughtful as we do it. So it's not the fact that you haven't seen more done is not indicative of anything other than it's just an ordinary process. Now part of what's been different too in fairness, we're typically not in the selling business. And we've been in the selling business for the last 1.5 years more than we ordinarily would be. And you've seen what we've done relative to the reading plant in Northern California, the tax replan in Southern California and even relative to our ready-mix business in Colorado. I mean, if you think back to it between Stockton, Reading to Tehachapi and our Colorado business that we sold, that's over $1 billion worth of divestitures. And that's not ordinary for us. But again we talk about the fact that, it's an aggregates-led business. And when we talk about cement, we talk about a strategic cement business. So -- some years most years we're going to be busier buying than selling. The last 1.5 years we've actually had more on the sell side than on the buy side for all the right reasons.\nTimna Tanners: Got it. Thanks, again.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nTyler Brown: Hi. Good morning.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Tyler\nTyler Brown: I want to come back to cost a little bit. So it feels like costs are -- they're obviously remaining fairly sticky here. You mentioned a little bit of easing. So just specifically, where are you seeing some of that moderation? Are you seeing in labor consumables, is maintenance starting to roll? Just a little bit of color there, would be helpful.\nWard Nye: Sure. I'll tell you, what I'll do I'll turn it to Jim, and ask him to come back and give you more granularity. If you think about overall cost, I mean have we seen supplies go up mid-single digits, yes. Have repairs gone up low double digits, yes, and contract services as well. But Jim, can give you a little bit more color on that.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. It's largely the same story as before, which is a continuing slow moderation in cost inflation, still elevated versus historical levels, slowly coming back to normal from where it was very elevated, but it still remains elevated. I would say, the most problematic areas are parts costs are still quite high. I don't see those coming down for a bit. But labor is behaving more and more normal, as we go on. But otherwise, I'd say, high single digits mid- to high single digit is the right way to think about it for the rest of this year getting a little bit better moderating next year. Again, I'm holding aside energy, which is very volatile and just holding that one aside because we don't know where that ends up going. Does that answer your question?\nTyler Brown: Yes. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate it.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Tyler.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. \nWard Nye: David, are you there?\nDavid MacGregor: I'm here now. Sorry, about that. I apologize. Congratulations, on a great quarter.\nWard Nye: Thanks so much David.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, I just wanted to sort of revisit the slide in your deck, on highway contract awards up 18%. And I get your thoughts in terms of what's changing in the lag from awards to stone demand and stone shipments?\nWard Nye: Yes. No, I think it's been Dave from my perspective, a fairly predictable and I think in large measure because we went for such an extended period of time, without more money coming from the federal government in a meaningful way on that. So, if you think about what happened, we had a decade plus of continuing resolutions. Then we had the FAST Act, that didn't have more money, but it did have more time. And so now what's happened is, you've had that very attractive double whammy of hey, here comes more money. Here comes more time. And you also had DOTs who had actually been building up their own budgets, for about 15 years because they weren't getting more money and more time from the federal government. So I think what we're going to see particularly in Martin Marietta states is, it's not so much driven by maintenance and repair. It's going to be more driven by bringing in new capacity. And that's important for a number of reasons. Number one, our states have had a lot of people move to them. So, if we're simply looking at overall population trends, I mean it's pretty eye-popping to think about the fact that, Texas has led all the states and population gains over the past decade adding four million people. If we're looking at Colorado, their population has grown 14.8% just since 2010. And mean North Carolina has been one of the fastest-growing states in the country. Georgia is going to move up to number 8 in the country in population. So if you think about, why these states need to add capacity, as opposed to maintenance and repair. That's a big reason. And if you're thinking about what happens from a lag perspective, on rather than putting new asphalt, on top of old asphalt but rather adding a new lane or building new roads, it frankly takes a little bit longer. Now, the punchline is it ends up being considerably more aggregates intensive. So, for us, it's like a big birthday. It's worth the wait sometimes. So, we feel like good things are coming from this but I think that's really driving that lag that we've seen the dollars are there. And you can see where they are. You can see what the state DOT budgets are. But again I think it's those states those budgets those population inflows that are driving a different nature of construction. What we'll see in Charlotte, what we'll see in Atlanta, what we'll see in Dallas is going to be a very different story than what you'll see in New York or what you'll see in Chicago.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Thanks very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning Jacklyn, Jim, Ward.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Dudas: You've been terrific observations about the markets and some of the puts and takes heading into end of this year 2024. Just wondering as you look at the residential side of the business in your important states it seems -- we're at a -- is that the flywheel that could impact positively expectations on volume given it seems like we're at a bottom or in this kind of longer base bottom given the affordability issues. Is that kind of where the help could come if volumes could get better? And is that a market that you'd be able to take advantage of given your positioning in your -- certainly your backlog and your ability to serve?\nWard Nye: Yes. Look, I think the answer Michael is yes and yes to all of the above. It's interesting because you've got two issues relative to housing in the United States today. We've talked about one of them and that is affordability and clearly seeing mortgage rates move to 23-year highs drive some of that. The other issue that doesn't get the airtime that it probably should but it does in our states is availability. And that's a big issue today. And single-family housing in the US is structurally underbuilt. I mean it's a practical matter it ought to be trending comfortably over one million starts a year at least as we drill it down to the markets in which most of our business is because again we're back to those population trends that I mentioned in the dialogue with Dave MacGregor just a few minutes ago. If you come to Raleigh, your biggest issue is can you find a house. Same issue in Charlotte. Same issue in Atlanta. In various degrees, the same issues in Dallas-Fort Worth and in Colorado today. So, to the extent that there could be some upside there. Could it be single-family housing-driven? I think so. And for example several things are happening. Our homebuilders looking at having their own mortgage companies within homebuilding companies? They are. Are they doing that because they want to keep building? They do. Do they want to keep building because they know the market is there? Absolutely. And in some instances are they building and basically building to rent even in the near-term because they recognize that they can do that. So, I think your point around a swing factor on housing is important. And I think it's relevant to say keep in mind single-family housing is two to three times more aggregates-intensive than is multifamily. So, if you're watching housing look is it nice to see multifamily go? Yes. Is it really nice to see single-family go? The answer is yes. But I think what we've just described is worth watching and could be a build in 2024. And I hope that helps Michael.\nMichael Dudas: It sure does. Excellent Ward. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning guys. Great quarter. Two quick questions, getting late in the call. Two quick questions. One where do you want us for Q4 because the range is pretty wide. And I'm just curious if we wanted to bake in an early onset to winter where would that put us? And then the second question is do you ever see yourself recreating what you've built in Texas and other geographies?\nWard Nye: Well, that's two big questions for a guy late in the call today Adam. A couple of things. I'll take the second part of that. I'll leave the first part to Jim. Texas is a tremendous market. And when we bought TXI and when we've done some of the moves that we've made in Texas since then frankly we thought it was going to be that kind of a market. But at the same time we're in some other markets today that are enormously attractive. Do we think we can do some very great things in California? Yeah, I think we can. Can we continue to grow our business in places like Florida and still in Texas and in Tennessee and others? The short answer is yes. But one thing I think is so important for me to say Adam is you should expect us to continue to be an aggregates-led company. And I think that part of what is so evident in these numbers is again how durable that is. Now with respect to Q4, I'll pivot over to Jim and he can talk to you a little bit more about how we see some puts and takes on that. But frankly a lot of it is going to be driven by when does winter show up in different parts of our business. So Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. So Q4 I would say look generally speaking look at the midpoint of whatever we put out that sort of -- the best way to think about it. What could push it to the bottom end? Ward mentioned obviously bad weather, rainy weather in Texas, early winter in the north part of our footprint. And then, of course, there's cost timing and shifts. There's nothing fundamentally happening that's troubling. Costs could shift from one quarter to the next causing volatility. It was slipped into Q1 that would help Q4. If they don't that would hurt Q4. So I think I'd just stick with the midpoint for now Adam and go with that.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. Thanks guys.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.\nWard Nye: Thank you again for joining today's earnings conference call. To conclude our strong third quarter results underscore the resiliency and secular durability of our aggregates-led business model through various business cycles. Our focus remains on building the world's safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates led public company for the benefit of our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders. Thanks to the disciplined execution of SOAR and the fidelity of our teams to safety, commercial and operational excellence. Martin Marietta is poised to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value in 2024 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results with you in February. As always we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes your conference call for today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacklyn. Welcome, everyone and thank you for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta once again delivered record results across nearly every financial and operational measure extending our long track record of industry-leading performance and responsible profitable growth. Thanks to the dedication of our colleagues across the enterprise, we achieved accompanying milestone by exceeding $2 billion in trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA for the first time. Our exceptional third quarter is highlighted by a 42% improvement in aggregates gross profit per ton despite lower shipments further validating the benefits of our value over volume commercial strategy and our commitment to operating with excellence, while meeting and exceeding our customers' needs. Importantly, while our work in continuous safety improvement is never done, I'm proud to report the company concluded our safest third quarter on record with total and lost time incident rates surpassing world-class levels. On another third quarter event it's notable that just yesterday on October 31 we finalized the sale of our Tehachapi California Cement plant substantially completing the planned asset sales from the 2021 Lehigh Hanson West acquisition. Consistent with our SOAR 2025 initiatives, this divestiture of a non-strategic asset provides us with additional balance sheet flexibility to advance our well-articulated path of quality aggregates-led growth. As detailed in today's earnings release, we raised our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, as pricing momentum will more than offset lower shipments and recently increased energy and related costs. Turning now to Martin Marietta's third quarter financial performance. We established all-time quarterly records across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $2 billion, a 10.1% increase. Consolidated gross profit of $676 million, a 38.6% increase. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $6.94 of 48.6% increase. Adjusted EBITDA of $705.2 million, a 32.3% increase and aggregates gross profit per ton of $7.89 of 42.4% increase. These results reinforce the durability of our aggregates-led business, which is strategically situated in well-curated geographies. These record results also reflect our team's focus on what we can control, despite heightened geopolitical tensions and persistent macroeconomic headwinds, including growth restrictive monetary policy and continued inflation. Shifting now to our third quarter shipment and pricing results. Aggregate shipments declined 7.3%. Our value over volume strategy is clearly an unapologetic component of that result, as a softening demand in certain Midwest and Southwest markets, which was partially offset by continued strength in key Southeast markets. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain very attractive with pricing increasing 20% or 17.2% on a mix adjusted basis, as we continue to expect fair value for our depleting resources. Near sold-out Texas cement conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, continue to drive strong product demand in a favorable commercial environment. Third quarter cement shipments of 1.1 million tons were flat to last year's comparable period and pricing grew 18.9%, as we continue to largely sell as much as we can produce. We expect favorable Texas Cement pricing dynamics will continue and accordingly announced a $15 per ton price increase effective January 1. Turning to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready-mixed concrete shipments increased 3.6%, while pricing improved a solid 20.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 5.7% and pricing increased 6.7%. Before providing our outlook for the remainder of 2023 and a preliminary view of 2024, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our third quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and into 2024, we remain confident Martin Marietta is well positioned to capitalize on attractive market fundamentals across our coast-to-coast footprint, specifically infrastructure demand from increased federal and state level investments and heavy industrial projects of scale should counterbalance headwinds in the light nonresidential and historically underbuilt residential sectors, which are more sensitive to tightening credit conditions and higher for longer interest rate expectations. In the third quarter, infrastructure accounted for 39% of total shipments, predictably building to a higher and more normalized portion of our overall business. The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand is meaningfully higher year-over-year. These infrastructure contract awards grew 18% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period, ending September 30, 2023. Collectively, we anticipate that the historic increase in public sector investment from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, record state departments of transportation budgets and voter-approved state and local transportation ballot initiatives will provide sustained multiyear demand to this aggregates intensive often countercyclical end market. Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market accounted for 33% of our third quarter shipments. Heavy side energy and manufacturing projects of scale continue to drive demand in this segment, as warehouse and data center construction continues to moderate from the post-COVID period. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States continues to trend favorably with the August season adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 at $198 billion at 66% increase from the August 2022 value of $120 billion. The Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS act together with significant private investments, provide funding certainty for these large-scale manufacturing and energy projects that we believe will be disproportionately and positively impactful in Martin Marietta markets. Importantly, we have both the ability and capacity to supply these large projects and with the successful execution of our commercial and operational excellence strategies will do so in a manner that is margin accretive. Moving to white non-residential, while third quarter shipments remained resilient, we expect the recent interest rate acceleration together with tighter commercial lending conditions may impact future demand. That said, the anticipated softness in this segment should be partially offset by the extended cycle and strength of the more aggregates intensive heavy nonresidential sector. Softening in the residential end market, which accounted for 23% of aggregate shipments this quarter, is expected to continue, driven by current mortgage rates which are nearing 23-year highs at 8%. While single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregates demand signaled a near-term bottom and inflection point over the summer, the current higher rates are exacerbating affordability challenges and driving our revised expectations of soft demand in this end market. Nonetheless, we fully expect this current single-family housing slowdown will reverse once home prices and borrowing rates find equilibrium, as demand far exceeds supply across key Martin Marietta markets, the result of significant underbuilding over the last decade and homeowners' reluctance to abandon low-rate mortgages. As we look to 2024, our preliminary view anticipates aggregate shipments will be effectively flat as increased infrastructure investment coupled with robust activity from heavy non-residential projects of scale should help balance expected softness in interest rate sensitive private construction end markets. We remain confident that favorable commercial dynamics underpinned by our value over volume pricing strategy will be supported by 2023 exit rates as well as the realization of our previously announced January 1, 2024 price increases. Together, we expect this will drive low-double-digit growth in aggregates pricing and another year of profitable growth in 2024. To conclude, our team achieved impressive results in nearly every aspect of our business against a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. One of Martin Marietta enduring qualities is our proven ability to adapt quickly and respond effectively and durably to changing circumstances. Accordingly, we are extremely proud of our company's exceptional safety, operational and financial performance through the first nine months of 2023. Moreover, our record-setting third quarter performance, together with our fourth quarter expectations, reinforce our confidence that we will deliver our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $2.1 billion on organic improvement of $500 million or 31% over 2022. Through the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, we intend to continue driving responsible and profitable growth in 2023 and into the future. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. You bet. Kathryn thanks for the question. So, several things. Can it affect degrees of tonnage going out the gate? Yes, it can. So if we're looking at the tonnage down this quarter versus the prior year quarter probably a little bit less than half of that was due to value over volume. And by the way, we're perfectly okay with that. We've got depleting reserves. That said, on average, we've got 70 years of reserves at current extraction rates. So we've got a long-lived business. But we know the reserves are worth more in the ground tomorrow than they are today. And if we're looking at really where we're seeding some share on, it tends to be lower-margin products. In other words things like base and fines. So part of what we're trying to do is we're talking with our customers to make sure that they understand really twice a year is something that we're looking at on revisiting our pricing. The other thing that's important to keep in mind relative to aggregates, and this is different from some other functions as well. It doesn't have to be a 24/7 business. In fact, in most of our locations, it's not and where you've got 24/7 businesses incremental volume can give a high degree of operating leverage. That's just not something with which we're encumbered, in aggregate. So we shut down each evening, and open up each morning and that gives us an enormous amount of flexibility. And then probably most importantly, Kathryn, when the volume does come back and by the way it typically does. It typically comes back at higher pricing. So, you can see the math. I mean the value over volume strategy works, it protects our reserves. It protects the longevity of our business. And it's something that we've been very clear, with our team is important to us and part of what you can see in the numbers is, that it's coming through. So, I hope that's responsive, Kathryn. Thank you for the question. Thanks for the question. As you know, when we went into cement in Texas, we said, we view that as a strategic cement business. And my prepared comments said, we sold a non-strategic asset in California. And we set strategic cement for set where we're an aggregates leader, where the market is naturally vertically integrated where we have a downstream business taking a significant portion of it in Texas it's about 30%, and where it cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water. Our Texas Cement business is very solid. And part of the reason on it is, it's in Dallas-Fort Worth and it's in San Antonio. So, it removed from the vicissitude of imports largely. So what we're seeing in that marketplace and what you saw in the quarter, is volumes were largely flat because we're broadly sold out. And we continue to largely sell, what we're producing. And part of what we're anticipating and part of what we've announced, is a $15 a ton price increase for cement effective January 1. So, I think that -- those data points give you, a good snapshot of where Texas Cement is today. Hi, Trey. Happy to try. Thanks for that. So we're thinking about the 2024 guide, similar to the way that we did the 2023 guide. What I mean by that, is the guide that we've given I think this is more to stay out immediately, does not include any midyears and again, just as we saw in 2023, we think we're going to have mid-years in 2024. But right now, the guide that we've given, does not assume that. So, I think that's important. Secondly, as I indicated in the previous question, we think midyears are becoming more and more the norm, with our customers and we think the expectations have been set, the customer letters that have gone out indicate that pricing is largely effective from January 1 to June 30. So in the correspondence that has already gone, people know that we're going to protect them through midyear. Now, in fairness there's a footnote to that. And the notable exception is California, where our pricing letters already include announced midyear so that our customers can plan for that in that marketplace. We've long talked about what we inherited when we bought the business in California and we're trying to address that. Just to be clear, California totaled 2024 increases right now look like that's going to be about $4 a ton across all products and markets, as we continue to implement that strategy in particular in what's a relatively new marketplace for Martin Marietta. Now to your point, if we're thinking about the way carryovers are going to work carryovers next year are probably going to be in the low single-digits so a little bit lower than they were this year. But again, we've got a lot of confidence in what we think we will come out with on January 1. And then, again, if we have something that even begins to replicate what we saw in midyear next year and frankly there's probably some upside to that Trey. So I think that gives you a good build on the way that we see that working based off exit rates in 2023. Great. Thanks so much. Stanley, thanks for the question and for the comments on the quarter. The M&A market is actually looking increasingly attractive. The level of dialogue has ramped up in the second half of this year. From my perspective, that wasn't a tremendous surprise. As you know, 2021 was a big year for M&A for us. And part of what we've been doing, since then is a lot of what you saw in today's announcement relative to the sale of Tehachapi, making sure we're getting our pricing right in different markets making sure we're getting our hands around the operations. And now, as we sit here today, several things are apparent. Number one, we're looking at a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x. So that's below our targeted range. Two, you can see from the financials what the cash flow in this organization looks like that can clearly help fuel and will fuel some aggregates led frankly from my perspective pure aggregate transactions. And then two or three, when we had the proceeds that have just come in from Tehachapi, it puts us in a very attractive place. Do I think we'll have anything to announce here in the rest of this year? Probably not. Do I hope that we'll have some things that we can announce early next year? I think that we will. So, more to come on that Stanley. But again, we like financially where we're sitting. We like strategically where we're sitting. We like what we believe or what we know we can do from a regulatory perspective because we think that's a differentiator right now. So we believe that we can continue to give you price. We believe we can continue to give you really good cost control. And we believe we can keep giving you good solid attractive M&A. And we think that's a hattrick that we can offer today. Thank you, Stanley. Hi, Jerry. Yes, I think, that's relatively fair. And if you think about it Jerry I think that's what we did in Q2 and I think that's what we've done in Q3. I mean I think part of what you're seeing is the world can go through different degrees of economic turmoil and this is a business that continues to be very steady very durable in all forms of markets. So I don't disagree at all. I'll turn it over to Jim in just a moment so he can add if there are any particular things that he wants to make sure he calls out. But one of the things that I think is worth noting Jerry, I mean, did energy help us this quarter? Absolutely it did. But I think part of what's so striking to me is even if we did not have the energy tailwind that we did this quarter we would have set new records this quarter anyway. And I think it's so important because I know what you're looking for those puts and takes I wanted to go ahead and address that one upfront because, while in the quarter that was powerful. It would have been a very powerful quarter even without that. Jim anything you want to add? Yes, Jerry, thanks for the question. I would say several things. One if you think about our ready-mix business it's almost uniquely in Texas and Arizona. And those are two very good markets. And one reason that they're good is look you're in New York if you look at your window you're going to see asphalt streets and when you get to the bridges you'll have concrete bridges. If you're in Texas you're writing on concrete roads and concrete bridges and you're building things structurally with concrete as well. So those markets tend to be more durable from a supply perspective because again you've got that really non-cyclical or often countercyclical infrastructure market that will place some meaningfully in in our ready-mix business. And clearly ASP was up 20% in ready-mix. That helped a lot but frankly volume was up very modestly. And again Texas is 80% of our volume in ready-mix. Now alternatively, if you go to HMA give you a sense of that's going to be full year probably about nine million tons. So it's a fairly notable business. Now practically speaking, it's in three places. It's in Minnesota, it's up and down the Rocky Mountains and it's in California. And what we saw there was ASP was up 6.7% because liquid wasn't moving as much. But the fact was Q3 was an all-time record of almost 3.9 million tons for us in asphalt. And keep in mind asphalt's going to be about 95% crushed down. So from our perspective that's a very attractive business, particularly, in Minnesota where as you recall Jerry it's largely an FOB business. So it's truly a material business for us there. And of that nine million tons, Minnesota is going to be a little bit over $3 million of it. So at least those are the quick puts and takes that we've got on that. Jim anything you want to add on that? Thank you, Jerry and take care. Good morning, Anthony. Thanks for the question. We had a couple of things. One in the Southwest, frankly, you had a lot of heat and the heat slowed some things down and you also had some timing relative to the large energy projects as well. So I see a lot of that being pushed off to the right. I mean clearly and it's not just the Southwest or Midwest issue. There are some degrees of softening relative to warehousing and data centers. I mean that's not a surprise. We anticipated that. But what we are seeing is a nice renaissance relative to manufacturing and then the timing of energy coming. Energy is not one of those issues that we have any concerns about. It's just relative to pace. So I think more than anything we had degrees of timing and we had certain degrees of softness that, from my perspective were broadly anticipated. And I think that's one of the reasons that when we were giving you our results at half year, part of what we indicated to you, is we thought we would probably see a near-term nature in volumes in the third quarter. So if we're looking at the way Q3 worked from our perspective Anthony, honestly, no big surprises including the way the pull-through came through and some -- obviously some very attractive incrementals in the quarter. Thank you. Well, the things that we stay focused on Phil is what can we control and how do we run our business and we do that based on what our needs are. So we're very focused on Martin Marietta. We're focused on where operations are we're focused on what our inventories look like. We're focused on what our reserves look like in the ground. And we're focused on what we feel like the market can bear relative to these products. So our perspective, those are really the unique drivers on that. As I indicated before, if you're looking at volumes for the quarter were our volumes down a little bit more than others yes probably, so are we okay with that? You bet. Do I feel like that's probably going to find more degrees of equilibrium going forward? I think it probably will. At the same time, if I'm looking at the geographies in which we tend to be focused, let's face it we're talking about Texas, that's going to be awfully good. I mean we're looking at a Texton budget for FY 2024 that it exceeds $18.5 billion. I mean that's just a massive budget in Colorado, recently passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill, that's going to be massive in that state here in North Carolina and it was something that I'm proud to have been part of the project. We structurally change the way that we're paying for infrastructure here. Now we're using a degree of sales taxes. And in FY 2024, it's going to ramp up to 4% here in North Carolina, because North Carolina recognized they needed to increase their spending by over $7 billion over the next decade. But even separate distinct from that, if we're looking in Florida right now, Florida is looking at a $17.2 billion budget for FY 2024 and that's an all-time record. And I feel like I've said for probably the last six or seven years, that every year is an all-time record for transportation in Florida, largely because it has been. And in California where we brought that new business the Caltrans budget is $20.5 billion next year. Now to give you a sense of it, that's a 5.5% or 5.6% year-over-year increase with $12.1 billion designated for highway and bridge capital spending. So as we're thinking about what that public funding looks like and we're coming back and looking at what's happening industrially in places like Atlanta what's going on in South Georgia, literally just yesterday, Toyota announced they're adding $8 billion to what is already a large battery plant that's underway in Randolph County that's just downside of Greensboro. These are the types of things that we're seeing in our markets both in public and heavy non-res that gives us a lot of confidence around the way that we think volumes will work next year. And the fact is with the footprint that we have, I don't have any doubt that we're going to get our fair share of that business. I just want to make sure that we're doing for what we feel like is fair value for that business. Yeah. Phil, those are great questions. I think on the public infrastructure side, we're still where we were. We said, we thought we would start to see that building in for and then build into 2024 -- when I say four, I mean Q4 of this year. And that was part of what led us to the commentary around the fact that we thought we'd probably see this type of dip in Q3. So again very anticipated, if we're looking for example at the large LNG projects, part of what we're seeing right now is several projects that are already underway. Golden Pass is underway, Chevron Phillips has a large facility in Orange, Texas that's underway, Port Arthur LNG, at least portions of that are underway, Cheniere has a lot this underway. But if we look going forward, I can think of at least four big jobs and I think this gives you a sense from a timing perspective in Texas that we're watching. Cheniere has another one in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. We are grand LNG in Brownsville and Freeport LNG in Texas, all are looking at we believe 2024 start dates. We're actually anticipating some acceptance of materials maybe as soon as this week on some of those projects. So it continues to be a live conversation. So if we think about it for the year has timing been a little bit of a headwind on those, yeah, it has. Do we think they're going away? Absolutely not. And part of what we're seeing and frankly in degrees this is helpful, you've got degrees of material tightness in some of those markets and that continues to underscore at least the notion of the overall economy in Texas today. So I hope that gives you a snapshot at least on some of the heavy non-recipe. You bet. Hi Timna. Timna, I'm sorry to interrupt you. We're having a hard time hearing you. Can you lean that a little bit more please? Yes ma'am, it is. Thank you. I don't think, they're affecting number one our geographies that much and two, to the extent that inflation or varying degrees of it continues to go through. Frankly, if we can keep up with that or stay ahead of it Timna, it's actually been an ally to our business, not an enemy to our business. So I do think if we had a strikingly different geographic profile then we have, I would probably feel differently about it than I do. But if we go back to that conversation I was having just a little while ago relative to our leading states and the degree of both public and private activity that we're seeing in Texas and Colorado and the Carolinas and Georgia and Florida. Those are very powerful steady markets right now. And I'm even taken to by the continued resiliency in markets like Indiana and in Iowa as well. Iowa is a state that has been very steady all the way through cycles for us including probably the single most steady market in which we participated during the great financial crisis. So, I just call that out, because it's one of those states that doesn't come to mind immediately, if you're in New York or Chicago or Dallas or Los Angeles thinking about this industry. But it's been one that for us that's been actually quite important and very durable. It's more of a timing issue than anything else, Timna. Obviously, you know what the process looks like. You're going to have dialogue with a potential company you want to acquire, you'll go through a valuation process, you might go through a letter of intent contracting and then you also have regulatory processes that you have to go through. And none of that's easy, but our team is essentially very good at it, but we're going to be thoughtful as we do it. So it's not the fact that you haven't seen more done is not indicative of anything other than it's just an ordinary process. Now part of what's been different too in fairness, we're typically not in the selling business. And we've been in the selling business for the last 1.5 years more than we ordinarily would be. And you've seen what we've done relative to the reading plant in Northern California, the tax replan in Southern California and even relative to our ready-mix business in Colorado. I mean, if you think back to it between Stockton, Reading to Tehachapi and our Colorado business that we sold, that's over $1 billion worth of divestitures. And that's not ordinary for us. But again we talk about the fact that, it's an aggregates-led business. And when we talk about cement, we talk about a strategic cement business. So -- some years most years we're going to be busier buying than selling. The last 1.5 years we've actually had more on the sell side than on the buy side for all the right reasons. Thank you, Timna. Good morning, Tyler Sure. I'll tell you, what I'll do I'll turn it to Jim, and ask him to come back and give you more granularity. If you think about overall cost, I mean have we seen supplies go up mid-single digits, yes. Have repairs gone up low double digits, yes, and contract services as well. But Jim, can give you a little bit more color on that. Thank you, Tyler. David, are you there? Thanks so much David. Yes. No, I think it's been Dave from my perspective, a fairly predictable and I think in large measure because we went for such an extended period of time, without more money coming from the federal government in a meaningful way on that. So, if you think about what happened, we had a decade plus of continuing resolutions. Then we had the FAST Act, that didn't have more money, but it did have more time. And so now what's happened is, you've had that very attractive double whammy of hey, here comes more money. Here comes more time. And you also had DOTs who had actually been building up their own budgets, for about 15 years because they weren't getting more money and more time from the federal government. So I think what we're going to see particularly in Martin Marietta states is, it's not so much driven by maintenance and repair. It's going to be more driven by bringing in new capacity. And that's important for a number of reasons. Number one, our states have had a lot of people move to them. So, if we're simply looking at overall population trends, I mean it's pretty eye-popping to think about the fact that, Texas has led all the states and population gains over the past decade adding four million people. If we're looking at Colorado, their population has grown 14.8% just since 2010. And mean North Carolina has been one of the fastest-growing states in the country. Georgia is going to move up to number 8 in the country in population. So if you think about, why these states need to add capacity, as opposed to maintenance and repair. That's a big reason. And if you're thinking about what happens from a lag perspective, on rather than putting new asphalt, on top of old asphalt but rather adding a new lane or building new roads, it frankly takes a little bit longer. Now, the punchline is it ends up being considerably more aggregates intensive. So, for us, it's like a big birthday. It's worth the wait sometimes. So, we feel like good things are coming from this but I think that's really driving that lag that we've seen the dollars are there. And you can see where they are. You can see what the state DOT budgets are. But again I think it's those states those budgets those population inflows that are driving a different nature of construction. What we'll see in Charlotte, what we'll see in Atlanta, what we'll see in Dallas is going to be a very different story than what you'll see in New York or what you'll see in Chicago. Thank you, David. Good morning, Michael. Yes. Look, I think the answer Michael is yes and yes to all of the above. It's interesting because you've got two issues relative to housing in the United States today. We've talked about one of them and that is affordability and clearly seeing mortgage rates move to 23-year highs drive some of that. The other issue that doesn't get the airtime that it probably should but it does in our states is availability. And that's a big issue today. And single-family housing in the US is structurally underbuilt. I mean it's a practical matter it ought to be trending comfortably over one million starts a year at least as we drill it down to the markets in which most of our business is because again we're back to those population trends that I mentioned in the dialogue with Dave MacGregor just a few minutes ago. If you come to Raleigh, your biggest issue is can you find a house. Same issue in Charlotte. Same issue in Atlanta. In various degrees, the same issues in Dallas-Fort Worth and in Colorado today. So, to the extent that there could be some upside there. Could it be single-family housing-driven? I think so. And for example several things are happening. Our homebuilders looking at having their own mortgage companies within homebuilding companies? They are. Are they doing that because they want to keep building? They do. Do they want to keep building because they know the market is there? Absolutely. And in some instances are they building and basically building to rent even in the near-term because they recognize that they can do that. So, I think your point around a swing factor on housing is important. And I think it's relevant to say keep in mind single-family housing is two to three times more aggregates-intensive than is multifamily. So, if you're watching housing look is it nice to see multifamily go? Yes. Is it really nice to see single-family go? The answer is yes. But I think what we've just described is worth watching and could be a build in 2024. And I hope that helps Michael. Well, that's two big questions for a guy late in the call today Adam. A couple of things. I'll take the second part of that. I'll leave the first part to Jim. Texas is a tremendous market. And when we bought TXI and when we've done some of the moves that we've made in Texas since then frankly we thought it was going to be that kind of a market. But at the same time we're in some other markets today that are enormously attractive. Do we think we can do some very great things in California? Yeah, I think we can. Can we continue to grow our business in places like Florida and still in Texas and in Tennessee and others? The short answer is yes. But one thing I think is so important for me to say Adam is you should expect us to continue to be an aggregates-led company. And I think that part of what is so evident in these numbers is again how durable that is. Now with respect to Q4, I'll pivot over to Jim and he can talk to you a little bit more about how we see some puts and takes on that. But frankly a lot of it is going to be driven by when does winter show up in different parts of our business. So Jim? Thank you, Adam. Thank you again for joining today's earnings conference call. To conclude our strong third quarter results underscore the resiliency and secular durability of our aggregates-led business model through various business cycles. Our focus remains on building the world's safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates led public company for the benefit of our shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders. Thanks to the disciplined execution of SOAR and the fidelity of our teams to safety, commercial and operational excellence. Martin Marietta is poised to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value in 2024 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results with you in February. As always we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "content": "Thank you, Ward and good morning, everyone. The Building Materials business posted record quarterly revenue of $1.92 billion, a 10.5% increase over last year's third quarter and record quarterly gross profit of $649.5 million, a year-over-year increase of 38.4%. Aggregates gross profit improved to 32.1% relative to the prior year period to a record $440.6 million, as pricing growth more than offset lower shipments and higher production costs, underscoring the strength and effectiveness of our value-over-volume commercial strategy, as a distinguishing hallmark to grow profitability through economic cycles. The business also achieved an aggregate gross profit margin of 36.2%, setting a new all-time profitability record despite the shipment decline. Our Texas Cement business also extended its track record of outstanding performance. Revenues increased 18.3% to $199.1 million, while gross profit increased 61.5% to $108.7 million. Pricing growth and lower energy costs, more than offset higher raw materials and maintenance costs. Domestic production capacity constraints and robust demand continue to drive extremely tight supply particularly in North Texas. As a reminder, Martin Marietta has taken two notable steps to increase our Texas Cement production capacity to capitalize on the supply-demand dynamics. First, we've homely converted our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement also known as Type 1L, at both our Midlothian and Hunter Texas plants. This conversion not only reduces our carbon footprint, but also expanded our production capacity by approximately 10%. Second, our Midlothian Texas plant is installing a new finish mill, providing 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity. This project should be fully operational in the third quarter of 2024. As previously discussed, we began utilizing the new silos to low customer trucks in July. In addition to increasing cement storage capacity by over 60%, these silos have considerably enhanced the customer experience by reducing lot cycle times and are saving our customers up to an hour at peak shipping times each day. Our concrete revenues increased 25.3% to $285.2 million and gross profit increased 81.8% to $34.1 million, driven primarily by steady volume growth pricing gains and mega project contributions which more than offset higher upstream raw material and delivery costs. Our asphalt and paying revenues increased 14.6% on $359.9 million and gross profit increased 33% to $66.1 million, reflecting higher selling prices and lower bitumen costs. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $75.5 million in the third quarter in line with the prior period and gross profit increased 3.6% to $21.4 million, softening demand in certain Magnesia end markets including TPO roofing and metal lining was more than offset by commercial and operational excellence initiatives and energy tailwinds. We expect demand to soften due to labor unrest in the automotive sector and Magnesia end-markets remaining weak in the fourth quarter and as such have reduced our Magnesia Specialties full year gross profit guidance. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase to our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, demonstrating its confidence in the durability and sustainability of our company's future growth and free cash flow generation. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.96. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times as of September 30th, representing balance sheet strength and flexibility to responsibly grow through quality acquisitions and prudent capital investments, while returning capital to Martin Marietta to shareholders. To conclude my prepared remarks, I want to emphasize that the record-breaking financial performance of this quarter and year-to-date has demonstrated a disciplined execution of our value over volume commercial strategy yields higher margins, higher profits and higher cash flow without the benefit of growing volumes. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ward. Yes. No it's just that the cost inflation continues to moderate slightly still elevated compared to historical levels. But again as we've demonstrated this year, we expect it to happen next year pricing growth exceeds cost inflation. So we do expect margins to expand next year. Yes. I mean, obviously, the bitumen pricing costs did help the asphalt pay business. improve margins. It wasn't wholly due to that of course. But on the ready mixed side I would say was very, very little additive from the lower energy costs. So hopefully that answers the question too just rounding out what Ward provided. Yes. It's largely the same story as before, which is a continuing slow moderation in cost inflation, still elevated versus historical levels, slowly coming back to normal from where it was very elevated, but it still remains elevated. I would say, the most problematic areas are parts costs are still quite high. I don't see those coming down for a bit. But labor is behaving more and more normal, as we go on. But otherwise, I'd say, high single digits mid- to high single digit is the right way to think about it for the rest of this year getting a little bit better moderating next year. Again, I'm holding aside energy, which is very volatile and just holding that one aside because we don't know where that ends up going. Does that answer your question? Yeah. So Q4 I would say look generally speaking look at the midpoint of whatever we put out that sort of -- the best way to think about it. What could push it to the bottom end? Ward mentioned obviously bad weather, rainy weather in Texas, early winter in the north part of our footprint. And then, of course, there's cost timing and shifts. There's nothing fundamentally happening that's troubling. Costs could shift from one quarter to the next causing volatility. It was slipped into Q1 that would help Q4. If they don't that would hurt Q4. So I think I'd just stick with the midpoint for now Adam and go with that."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company\u2019s website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.\nJennifer Park: Thank you. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance.

A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Welcome everyone and thanks for joining this quarterly teleconference. I am pleased to report Martin Marietta\u2019s exceptional performance across nearly every safety, financial and operational measure in the second quarter, which built upon our record first quarter performance. Given the overall challenging macroeconomic environment, including continued monetary policy tightening and the related residential housing slowdown, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team\u2019s focus and resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also finalized the divestiture of our Stockton, California cement import terminal in the second quarter, further enhancing our company\u2019s margin profile and improving the durability of our business through cycles. As indicated in today\u2019s earnings release, we revised our 2023 guidance to reflect the company\u2019s results from the first half of the year and our current expectations for the second half. Notably, we raised our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to range from $2 billion to $2.1 billion or a 28% increase at the midpoint as compared with the prior year. The core assumption underpinning the adjusted EBITDA guidance is that accelerated commercial momentum will more than offset lower shipments and higher costs as we endeavor to continue managing the last 2 years of historic inflation. Further, given the typical lag effect between single-family housing starts and aggregates demand, we expect recent aggregate shipments declines will find a bottom in the third quarter of 2023. Against that backdrop, Martin Marietta achieved strong second quarter results across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $1.82 billion, an 11% increase; consolidated gross profit of $560 million, a 32% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $596 million, a 25% increase; and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.80, a 28% increase. These stellar results reflect the continued disciplined execution of our strategic plan through economic cycles. Shifting now to our second quarter shipment and pricing results, starting with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 5.7% as we experienced the expected lag between last year\u2019s decline in single-family housing starts and our shipments to the residential market. Predictably though, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 18.6% or 17% on a mix-adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Second quarter shipments were a record 1.1 million tons and pricing grew 21.8%. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and expect solid realization of the $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 1.7%, while pricing increased a robust 21.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 1.7% and pricing improved 7.9%. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our second quarter discussion with a review of the company\u2019s financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward and good day to everyone. The Building Materials business posted record second quarter revenues of $1.74 billion, an 11.6% increase over last year\u2019s comparable period and a quarterly gross profit record of $536.1 million, a 34.3% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 20.7% relative to the prior year period resulting in a quarterly record of $370.9 million as strong pricing growth and lower diesel fuel expenses more than offset lower shipments and increased non-energy-related costs. Our Texas cement business also continued its track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.7% to $197.7 million and gross profit increased 84% to $93.3 million. As previously discussed, our Midlothian, Texas plant is installing a new finish mill that we expect to be finished in the third quarter of 2024. Upon completion, the new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today\u2019s sold-out Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace. This project will achieve its first major milestone this month as our new cement titles will begin loading customer trucks. The new silos and load-out system are dramatically improving customer service by reducing load-out cycle times by as much as 45 to 60 minutes per truck during periods of peak shipping. In addition, this project has increased cement storage capacity by over 60%. The process of converting our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as Type 1L is now complete at both our Midlothian and Hunter, Texas plants. We expect the Type 1L conversion to provide additional production capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022 and helped reduce our carbon footprint. Our ready-mix concrete revenues increased 19.7% to $271.4 million and gross profit increased 142.3% to $35.4 million, driven primarily by strong pricing gains in the quarter, more than offsetting higher upstream raw material costs. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 11.7% to $240.9 million and gross profit increased 37.9% to $36.5 million due to pricing improvement, coupled with lower bitumen costs as compared to the prior period. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $80.5 million in the second quarter, in line with the prior year quarter and gross profit increased 13% to $27.7 million. Notably, gross margin increased 440 basis points from the prior year quarter to 34.4%, driven by pricing growth and moderating energy expenses. As a general matter, energy costs are down from last year\u2019s highs and have now seemingly stabilized. Non-energy costs continue to grow at rates well above historical averages and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of this year. That said, expected midyear price increases should serve to offset the expected cost inflation. During the quarter, we returned $116 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 178,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $422 per share in the second quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.1x, within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. This balance sheet strength gives us ample flexibility to continue investing in the business and pursuing accretive acquisition opportunities, while at the same time, extending our long record of returning capital to Martin Marietta\u2019s shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. With this year\u2019s construction season well underway, we are confident in Martin Marietta\u2019s bright prospects for the remainder of 2023. We continue to be encouraged by a number of factors that support sustainable demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy non-residential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the infrastructure investment in Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects for years to come. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated from any mild-to-moderate private sector contraction. We began with infrastructure, which accounted for 36% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government, highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is again meaningfully higher year-over-year, with growth of 25% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2023. Importantly, in addition to incoming IIJA funding, state legislatures are choosing to commit considerable investment to transportation projects. For example, Texas and North Carolina have directed portions of sales tax collections to infrastructure, while Florida is transferring general funds to augment State Department of Transportation resources. We expect this increase in public sector investment to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important often countercyclical end market. Moving now to non-residential construction, which represented 35% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. As warehouse construction has moderated from its post-COVID peak, other heavy industrial projects led by onshore manufacturing and energy continued to drive demand in this segment, accounting for the majority of total non-residential shipments. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States has accelerated to well above record levels as the MACE seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 is $194 billion, a 76% increase from the May 2022 value of $110 billion. Since 2021, supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act, private companies have announced over $500 billion in commitments to invest in critical sectors like semiconductors and electronics, electric vehicle and related batteries and clean energy as those projects are both economic and national security consequence. Further, the nation\u2019s aim to be the global leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to drive substantial demand for new data centers for the foreseeable future. As a result, we expect an extended cycle within the aggregates intensive heavy non-residential sector. We also remain optimistic about Martin Marietta\u2019s light non-residential end markets, where we have yet to experience any notable weakness as shipments to in-process projects continue. We are actively monitoring this portion of the segment, but expect any possible future softness to be partially offset by the relative strength of the more aggregates intensive, heavy non-residential project pipeline. Moving to residential. Shipments to this segment accounted for 24% of total aggregate shipments this past quarter. Given the structural housing deficit in key Martin Marietta markets, we correctly anticipated that the affordability-driven residential slowdown would be short-lived. Accordingly, we are encouraged by recent public homebuilder sentiment and single-family starts data, which are indicative of a near-term bottoming and inflection point. The significant underbuilding over the last decade, coupled with existing homeowners reluctance to abandon their low rate mortgages, is exacerbating the housing deficit, thus available home inventory is being disproportionately driven by new home construction, a notable trend that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting second quarter performance provides outstanding momentum and a solid foundation for the balance of the year. As a result, we are confident in our ability to achieve our raised 2023 financial guidance. We believe our most recent results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model and our team\u2019s steadfast commitment to health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives will support our success. We remain focused on building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Ward, Jim.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Trey.\nTrey Grooms: I guess I want to touch on the cement volume, Ward. It was \u2013 seeing it was actually up slightly year-over-year on a tough comp and it\u2019s no secret that Texas weather wasn\u2019t particularly favorable in the quarter. And granted, I think maybe cement can hold up a little bit better in bad weather than maybe aggregates or asphalt, but that\u2019s still impressive. Could you give us a little more color on kind of the drivers there in Texas for cement what you are seeing there with those end markets? And with that, you mentioned you expect favorable traction on the midyear cement increase. Any additional color you could give us around that?\nWard Nye: Happy to, Trey. Thank you for the question. So first, you are right, it was weather in Texas. We had 20 weather-impacted days this quarter as opposed to 16 in the last quarter. I think what that does tell you is the essence of what you asked is right. That is cement because some of it is going to vertical construction as opposed to horizontal construction can actually weather better than aggregates can or asphalt can, because they are both going down literally on the ground in most instances. What I would say relative to the business, number one, it is very durable in Texas. If we go back to our definition of strategic cement, the business we have in Dallas and the business we have in San Antonio fits it perfectly. If we think about Texas as the market all by itself, North Texas is the single healthiest market in Texas. So if we look at the way Midlothian continues to perform and it\u2019s performing very well. That was the single strongest cement performer that we had. That said, Hunter was a very solid performer as well. So if we are looking at overall volumes at 1.1 million tons, the important thing to remember is markets largely sold out. So in essence, short of that capital project coming through next year, we are basically running at capacity. So having a cement business in Texas with the biggest piece of it in Dallas-Fort Worth, running at capacity is a really good start for a cement business. The second part of your question was relative to the midyear, we have announced a $10 per ton midyear price increase in cement in Texas. We think we are going to get very good traction on that, so more to come on that as we come toward Q3, but again, a very solid performance by our team. They continue operationally to run that business extraordinarily well. Again, if you are looking at what the pricing has done. Q2 saw pricing up 21.8%, even if you look at mix adjusted, it was still over 21%. But as Jim outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to see in different parts of the business, degrees of inflation. So part of what we are trying to do with our pricing is stay at least even or try to do some catch-up on that. So Trey, I hope that\u2019s responsive.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the color, Ward and keep up good work. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Trey.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nStanley Elliott: Hye, good morning, Ward, Jim. Thank you, guys for the question. Ward, I guess we\u2019re getting halfway to the point of the SOAR \u201825 program you outlined a couple of years ago. Where do you think we are strategically from an overall perspective, and I say it in the context that now you have an infrastructure bill, there is other government programs that really weren\u2019t on the table at that time? I\u2019d just like to see how you\u2019re thinking about things.\nWard Nye: Stanley, thanks for that question. So a couple of things. One, if we think about what we outlined is important. We talked about value over volume. If we\u2019re looking at price cost spread, we\u2019re 200 bps ahead of that today. So I think from that perspective, where we thought we would be. If we\u2019re looking at bringing operational excellence to the enterprise, and we\u2019re looking at the best safety metric rates at this time of year we\u2019ve ever seen. If we\u2019re looking at continued throughput and tons produced per working man hour, they continue to go up. But if we also take a look at what we said we would do relative to growing our business, the short answer is we\u2019re ahead of plan on that. If in year 1 in 2021, we bought Tiller and Lehigh West. We spent year 2 really last year and the year before, doing portfolio shaping and really getting our leverage back down to the areas that we told you that we would. So keep in mind, in a post West Coast world, we are modestly over 3x levered. Today, we\u2019re down to 2.1x. So when we\u2019re looking at our range of debt to EBITDA to 2.5x, we\u2019re actually the lower end of that. And then I think importantly, if we\u2019re looking at the pipeline that we have today to continue growing our business, it\u2019s a very attractive pipeline. And I think what\u2019s important in that, Stanley, is it\u2019s attractive in the areas that we\u2019ve continued to say are most important to our business, and that\u2019s back to the notion of an aggregates-led business. So again, if we\u2019re measuring where we were from the perspective of, we said we thought during that 5-year period, we could double our market cap. Math tells me we\u2019re like 60% plus there. and we\u2019re about halfway through. So again, tactically, I like where we sit. If we look strategically on how we think it\u2019s coming together. Look, I think at the end of the day, the plan works. So thank you so much for the question.\nStanley Elliott: Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.\nWard Nye: You bet. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Please go ahead.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. I guess some good color on guidance, but just a couple of clarifications on the updated EBITDA guidance. pricing is improving, but volumes are adjusted given today\u2019s results, they can step back. How much does pricing versus lower costs for certain categories playing the change? And what are you seeing in key end markets? We know Texas and North Carolina are key states that are doing quite well, but are there other end markets from a geographic standpoint that are contributing to the change in guidance? Thank you.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Kathryn, thanks for the question, too. So look, if we\u2019re looking at really what the drivers are, clearly, what we\u2019re seeing relative to average selling price is the single largest driver that we have right now. If we\u2019re looking at Q2 in aggregates up 18.6%, a really nice performance, obviously, in cement. We talked about that over 20% ready-mix, tracking the same thing. These are all important points relative to the revised EBITDA guidance. And it does give you a sense that in today\u2019s world, pricing is actually considerably more powerful than volume is. And I think that\u2019s, to me, in so many respects, part of what\u2019s important to underline. To that end, if we\u2019re looking at the volume and we\u2019re seeing what some of the differences are several things are worth noting. One, relative to volume, we think in the quarter, we lost about 1 million tons simply due to weather. If you were here in the Mid-Atlantic, what you saw is the second half of June was, frankly, a washout. It rained nearly every day. So when the Carolinas and Georgia are feeling that we feel that on volume. I think importantly, too, if we\u2019re looking at value over volume and what we think that cost us relative to volume for the quarter, we think that was probably about 1 million tons. And by the way, we think that was probably a pretty good trade. Equally, if we\u2019re looking at what Jim and I both spoke to in our prepared comments and that is with respect to the residential market. Again, we think housing itself has found bottom, but we tend to lag in that on the stone finds us waiting new subdivisions. So we think we\u2019re actually troughing in that as we sit here probably today going into the third quarter, we think that probably cost us about 0.5 million tons. So again, if you\u2019re looking at what the drivers are going to be, will price be the disproportionate driver? Yes. Have we given up some volume on occasion intentionally and purposely because we feel like really holding firm on some of the pricing that we feel like is fair, is the right thing to do relative to our shareholders? We do. And then to the last part of your question relative to how different markets look, here\u2019s what I would tell you. The Southeast remains strong. If we\u2019re looking at the Carolinas, if we\u2019re looking at Atlanta, if we\u2019re looking at coastal markets in the East, they continue to be quite good. If we\u2019re looking in Texas, in many respects, the results speak for themselves. But in particular, Dallas-Fort Worth in the North and Austin are strong. San Antonio and Houston are feeling degrees of residential weakness. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a surprise any place. If we\u2019re looking at Colorado, Colorado had a very wet June, as I mentioned, it was the wettest June on record. But if we\u2019re looking in California and Arizona, here\u2019s where we see really strong demand in Phoenix. We see strong demand in Southern California. The places that are a little bit weaker, it\u2019s a little bit weaker in San Francisco Bay Area. We thought it would be coming into the year. It\u2019s a little bit weaker in portions of the Midwest. Again, that\u2019s a cold weather market that in many respects, it\u2019s just starting to hit its stride right now. But modestly weaker there. But overall, if we\u2019re doing a heat map across our markets in the United States, given how intentional we\u2019ve been in building our business in areas that continue to have good population inflows, very good public spending and good private growth. We\u2019re seeing better markets than not. And again, that\u2019s not a big surprise to us, Kathryn. So again, I think I hit the points that you wanted to be raised, but I hope that helps.\nKathryn Thompson: Yes. Thanks very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Ward, I just wanted to maybe build on Kathryn\u2019s question there about the time you walk through 1.5 million tons of displaced business that related to weather and other I guess I just wanted to get your assessment of maybe the totality of what you might be behind in terms of tonnage here just because of disruptive weather and construction projects generally running behind at this point of the year? And how much of that can realistically be captured in the second half of \u201823? And I guess just secondly, how much availability is there in the current transportation and handling infrastructure capacity to support the fourth quarter volume surge in seasonal markets if that\u2019s an option, if that\u2019s a possibility?\nWard Nye: David, good morning. Thanks for the question. Again, if I go through and telling them look, I think weather was 1 million. I think value over volume is another 1 million. I think residential market softening was probably 500,000. I think in some instances, frankly, just having availability of certain sizes was probably somewhere north of 500,000. So again, you start telling those up, you\u2019re getting a lot closer to 3 million than 2 million by just some quick math. If I think about really what it looks like for the rest of the year, we did our best to try to capture in the revised guidance, how we thought that was going to play I do think it\u2019s important to reemphasize what I said in the commentary. Look, I think we\u2019re likely because of housing and the timing on housing defined volume in Q3, the most challenged of the year. I think so. Do I think we\u2019re likely to see an inflection in 4. I do in large measure because last year\u2019s 4 was not a particularly compelling fourth quarter. And again, as we see the build go through 3, I think we\u2019ve taken a very measured view. And of course, it\u2019s easier to do it in late July than it is in late February on how the year is going. So I think we\u2019ve captured pretty well how we think volume is going to play out for the rest of the year. And the other thing that I think is worth keeping in mind, David, is the way pricing is working now and how we see that working for the rest of the year. Because keep in mind, part of what happens at this time of year, as we report Q2 is the central part of the United States that tend to be cold weather markets, but equally don\u2019t tend to be as high priced markets as some of the ones that we have on the East Coast simply rolled in. So what do I mean by that? Aggregates cost more in Charlotte than they do in Cincinnati. So remember, you\u2019re always going to have a little bit of an optical headwind relative to pricing at half year. So again, as we think about volume, we feel like we\u2019re in a perfectly good place on volume, and we think it\u2019s going to build going into 4. We really like the way pricing has worked. And keep in mind, we took so much of our pricing and accelerated that first price increase from January and April, almost exclusively to January. So you had a number of different themes that are in play that in some respects, the market is seen for the very first time in this quarter, at least through an annual snapshot. But David, what I try to do is give you a sense of how we think volumes will build, how we think the pricing is going to come back to support that. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we saw midyear price increases in over half of our markets. And I think if somebody had thought that\u2019s what Martin Marietta is going to see when we came out with our guidance in February, I think they would have been very pleased with that. an I know we are as a management team.\nDavid MacGregor: And just on that Ward, normally, your mid-year pricing would be mid to high 20s traction. In this environment, are we likely to see higher traction rates on these mid-years this year?\nWard Nye: I think the traction rate will actually be good on the midyears. And as I\u2019m sitting here looking at the guide, honestly, if I\u2019m wondering if there is some place that we might be a little bit light on it, it may be on that pricing guide. I think the pricing is going to actually look really good for the year. And I think we can exit the year probably in some instances, pretty close to a 20 figure this year, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Great. Thanks very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Thank you. Hi, good morning, everyone.\nWard Nye: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: What I wonder if you could just pick up the discussion where you just left off in terms of the carryover effect of the mid-year price increases? So essentially, with the bulk of the benefits coming in 2024. Can you talk about what level of price carryover effect will we just naturally have in \u201824 before taking into account the January 1 price increase based on the magnitude and the traction of the mid-years?\nWard Nye: Yes, Jerry, that\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t want to go into specific details on that yet because, obviously, we will come out early next year and give good guidance for 2024. But I think several things are worth thinking, Jerry. One, do I think it will give us a nice carryover into \u201824? The answer is yes. Do I think we will end up seeing good price increases in January that will help build on that? The answer to that again is yes. So I think what we\u2019re seeing is a pricing cycle right now that\u2019s going to be better than the pricing cycle that you\u2019ve typically seen even separate and apart from what has been a pretty high inflationary market. In other words, if you go back and look at what aggregates were doing at a normal rhythm and cadence even prior to the last, say, 1.5 years. I think what you can expect going forward is going to outkick that coverage that you would have historically seen. So again, do I think midyear help with that? I do. Do I think the price increases that will come back in, in January will help build upon that? Yes. And do I think we\u2019re going to continue to see good sticking on the midyears that we put in place this year. And the answer to that is, again, a resounding, yes, Jerry. So I think from an outlook perspective, pricing has always been something that people have looked to Martin Marietta and said it broadly works. And I think what they are going to come to the conclusion of is it\u2019s going to work in the future even better than it has in the past. And I think that\u2019s saying something.\nJerry Revich: And Ward, in one of the prepared materials that you folks have for the call, you spoke about pretty low pricing starting point in California on the assets that you just acquired. Can you just talk about the pricing path and the decision not to put even more substantial price increases considering where the starting point is for that asset?\nWard Nye: So I guess I just want to make sure that my writing was clear in some instances, maybe wasn\u2019t. What we\u2019re saying is we\u2019ve seen, since we bought that business, ASPs up around $4.50 a ton in that marketplace. And by the way, that was a marketplace that \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about it, Jerry, it was below Martin Marietta corporate average in a state that typically sees higher pricing. So seeing aggregate up since we\u2019ve acquired that business about $4.50 a ton. We think given the barriers to entry, we think with the reserve depletion plays at the California sees generally, that\u2019s a very responsible place for us to be on moving that. The other thing that I\u2019ll tell you is as we\u2019re sitting here now, we\u2019re expecting probably another $2 a ton when we start getting closer to January 2024. So just as we\u2019ve seen in different markets, when we bring the commercial philosophy to a business over an extended period of time, the pricing and the commercial aspects of the business tend to work quite well. And again, I haven\u2019t been surprised by anything that we\u2019ve seen in California, and I\u2019m pretty pleased with where that business is going. And the other piece of it, Jerry, that you\u2019ve watched very carefully is our team has been superb at managing what we\u2019ve had in discontinued operations since we bought the business. So as you can tell, there is very little left now in disc ops. And again, we\u2019ve been very intentional in skinning that business down to what we do, what we do best, very focused and our work there, frankly, is almost done and the commercial aspects of clearly work. So Jerry, I hope that helps.\nJerry Revich: Absolutely. Thank you, Ward. And can I ask just one last one? Jim, in terms of COGS per ton for aggregates, it looks like they were up about 14% year-over-year in the second quarter. I\u2019m wondering any items that you\u2019d call out because diesel, I think, should have been a tailwind. Obviously, volumes were down, but any other factors that impacted...\nWard Nye: Let me ask Jim to respond to that. So what you\u2019re going to hear is energy is a good guy. And then there is some other things that are a bit of a headwind.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. No, the non-energy cost inflation is still with us, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, but things that are also above and beyond that, we did ship more tons via rail this quarter and the rate per ton on those rails shipped stone was higher as well. So that had a disproportionate effect. And again, it\u2019s only quarter so it\u2019s an outsized effect but that was a big piece of it as well as additional repairs costs that we incurred in the quarter. So those are the two things that will probably help drive that number up a bit, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Got it. Thank you. And congrats to the team.\nWard Nye: Jerry, thanks so much. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks. Wondering about cement gross margin. It\u2019s at an all-time high at this point. And I know you\u2019re adding the finishing mill next year to Midlothian. But conceptually, has the margin structure in that business been changed for the long-term?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. Jerry, it\u2019s Jim \u2013 Garik, sorry. It definitely has changed. I think the margins you\u2019re seeing today are not anomalous. I would expect them to continue. The only thing that might affect that is if we saw a spike in natural gas prices, of course. But that\u2019s \u2013 I would say at this point, it\u2019s performing where we like it at. We think there is other ways to improve it further down the road, but I would view today\u2019s margins as repeatable and enduring.\nWard Nye: And to that end, part of what the team has done so well in Texas. They have been focused on reliability. They have been focused on utilization. And they have also been focused on making sure commercially again, they are getting the right value for that product. And remember, that marketplace is largely sold out. So that certainly helps us. So then coming back as we will here over the next year, with the Midlothian FM 7 project and adding much-needed tonnage to that on top of reliability on top of utilization should put that business in an even more enviable position. And part of what I think we can be so proud of as a team has been the evolution of what that cement businesses look like in North Texas since the 2014, 2015 time frame. It\u2019s consistently gotten better, and we think it can continue to do just that, Garik.\nGarik Shmois: Makes sense. Thanks. \nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Keith Hughes of Truist. Please go ahead.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. The implied guidance in aggregates in the second half of the year, is there any way to tease out what infrastructure is going to be that. I\u2019m really looking for the influence of the infrastructure law, what role it\u2019s playing in the second half of the year?\nWard Nye: Yes. Thank you for the call, Keith. So, as we just think through the way that we think that\u2019s going to look, we think infrastructure for the year is likely to be up mid-single digits. And previously, we had been at mid-single to high-single. So again, we continue to see this roll out. We think, particularly as we get towards the 3 and 4, and remember, we said we thought this would be a back half loaded from an infrastructure perspective. We see that continuing to play the same way. Again, when we came out early in the year, we said we thought single-family would be down low-double digits, I think that\u2019s exactly what we are going to see, so no big surprise there. Again, if we look at non-res for the quarter that just ended, we had a basic breakdown of 55% heavy, 45% light. And what we actually think we are going to see is that heavy piece of it is actually going to get heavier. So, as we watch that rollout and we see some of these large manufacturing jobs come in, again, we think that\u2019s likely to be overall for the year, probably down mid-single digits. So, we do think looking at the end users, infrastructure is the one that\u2019s really starting to move at this point. And we think the primary volume play is that switches that we talked about a minute ago, and that is where we are with housing found, we believe, having found bottom, but shipments not yet having caught up with that. So, Keith, I hope that helps you think about the end users and at least the way we are looking at it on a percentage basis.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.\nWard Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPhil Ng: Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Cement results were really good guys. Were there any one-time drivers maybe timing of maintenance that led to that upside, or can we just kind of take that run rate in the first half and build off of that? And then Jim, you talked about how you are unlocking potentially some storage capacity and the ramp-up on PLC. Will that be bigger contributors on the volume side in the back half of this year, or you already started seeing it this year already?\nJim Nickolas: No. It\u2019s \u2013 well, to answer your first question, there is not really any one-time good guy in this quarter for cement. So, that\u2019s why when I answered the question earlier, I think it\u2019s enduring. Again, there is no anomalous things happening this quarter. So, we can expect these margins to repeat. As it relates to the cement storage capacity, that helps us throughout the year that we will going forward, it\u2019s in our guidance. And then the, of course, finish mill seven to when it comes online next year, that will be another boost to our capacity and our volumes. But our guidance number includes those volumes at this point for this year.\nWard Nye: Just one quick note to that. As we said, the transition to PLC or Type 1 does give us modestly more volume this year as compared to last. But it\u2019s not a huge mover. We are talking, again, mid-single digits on a percentage basis.\nPhil Ng: Got it. And then sorry to sneak one more in. Implicit in your guidance, Jim, are you baking in midyear price increases for cement and agg in the numbers along with what are you assuming on your assumptions on energy? I think previously, you were talking about diesel being kind of flattish in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about it at this point in your guidance?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. The first part of the answer to your question is yes, midyears are in for both agg and cement in the guidance. On energy, it\u2019s, we use, again, really late Q2 energy levels and assume that continues for the rest of the year. So, that\u2019s sort of the foundation for the guidance. Now of course, oil prices have come up a bit since then, but we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to stick or not, but that\u2019s how we think about it. I would say, in total, this guidance versus prior guidance, energy is a bit of a larger tailwind than we thought. Non-energy costs were a bit of a larger headwind than we thought they kind of net out, leaving us with, the upside is largely price driven, and some of that\u2019s taken back with lower volumes. That\u2019s how I would think about it in the broad buckets, Phil.\nPhil Ng: Okay. Really helpful. Appreciate it.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTimna Tanners: Yes. Good morning and thanks for the detail. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on Slide 11. Two questions on these categories. One is if you could talk to us about the aggregates intensity of them, in particular, trying to focus on warehouses since that\u2019s been such a big delta with some of the starts data coming through a lot lower. And then trying to also get color on each of these categories on what you are seeing in your order books or your backlogs, particularly in some of these big categories? Thanks a lot.\nWard Nye: Timna, thank you so much for that. So, I guess I would say several things. One, if we are looking at domestic manufacturing and energy and data centers. So, those are items one, two and three on Slide 11. What I would say is, number one, we capture all of those as heavy non-res. So, again, in today\u2019s world, probably 55% of our non-res book of business. Number two, if we compare that to what maybe like commercial, retail and hospitality would look like, I have to tell you, it\u2019s probably 7x to 9x more intensive than a single-standing big-box store maybe. So, if you are looking at the overall square footage, number one, and you are looking at the nature of the construction, number two, meaning what do the roads look like going in, they are almost all concrete. What did the walls look like, they are almost all concrete. What did the floors look like, they are concrete. And then if we throw a bone to our Magnesia Specialties business, oftentimes, the roofing is TPO. So, these large domestic manufacturing and data centers are almost Martin Marietta envelope. So obviously, energy does not because it\u2019s typically open. But if we also think about what\u2019s going on with those very large energy projects along the Gulf Coast of the United States, Again, the notices to proceed are coming on those \u2013 the tonnage that\u2019s required on those is very significant tonnage, and we are starting to see movement in lending of those contracts. So again, if we look at 11 and we look at the outlook for those top three that shows full green. And we look at the outlook for the lighter piece of it that\u2019s showing yellow. It doesn\u2019t mean that those that are in yellow were not going forward, they are. It just doesn\u2019t have the same rate and pace. But what we have at the top of the page tends to be some of the more aggregates-intensive. And again, from a percentage perspective, I would say oftentimes 7x to 9x more aggregate intensive than other light non-res activity.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So, just to be clear then on the warehouses, in particular, we heard that was a huge contributor in the past several years to demand and now seeing those starts come down in the most recent data as much as over 50%. So, I am just wondering if you have seen kind of the big swing there. It doesn\u2019t look like it from the yellow color, but I just wanted a little more information.\nWard Nye: No, I appreciate it. And in the prepared remarks, like we said that we haven\u2019t seen even on the light side of it, that big a change yet. And we are watching it and we are sensitive to what could happen because of the way interest rates are moving because that tends to be something pay that\u2019s more interest rate-sensitive. Obviously, some of that was driving simply because of COVID, the way that people are shopping and the way some of that work. Obviously, Amazon was very clear that they said they were pulling back on some of that. The fact is there were others who frankly had some catch-up that they needed to do. And I think one reason we haven\u2019t felt as acutely as others, Timna, is how intentional we have been in building on corridors. So, if you look at the Martin Marietta footprint, you are going to see I-5 as a major corridor. You can see I-25 and the Rockies is a major corridor. You are going to see I-35 through the middle of Texas is a major corridor, not to mention 85 and 95 on the East. And then another component of it that I think is important, we are the largest shipper of stone by rail in the United States. So, we will ship almost 2x what our closest competitor will by rail. The reason I mentioned that is distribution up and down rail networks, we think is going to be pretty notable as well. So, when we go through those and you see yellow in areas that you otherwise might think based on commentary, it might be trending towards red. I think a lot of that\u2019s driven by the where and the how that we are moving our stone.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detail.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Timna.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning.\nWard Nye: Hi Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Jim, first in aggregate, so I think you answered my question on baseline diesel. But what is the expected non-fuel unit cost inflation expected to be for this fiscal year that\u2019s based in the guide because it feels very high? And then secondly, Ward, just given that supply chain issues have eased, it feels like the OEs seem to be improving deliveries, whether it\u2019s yellow iron or trucks, and we have seen some par price disinflation. But basically, my question is, is there any building optimism that repairs and supplies could be a good story into \u201824 on the cost side, or am I maybe a little bit out of my skis on that? Thanks and sorry, for the double question.\nJim Nickolas: Sure. So, I would say that on the non-energy inflation front, high-single digits is what we are looking at for the rest of the year. I do expect that to taper a bit as we go into the year, into next year, and I would expect it to be lower next year, more closer to normal. But \u2013 and so from that perspective, there may be a tailwind. But the repairs expense that we are incurring this year, I wouldn\u2019t view it as just for the quarter that is going to cause much of a comparison good or bad for next year, if that was the \u2013 if that was the answer to your question.\nWard Nye: And I think, Tyler, going back to your other question on supply chain and how that\u2019s working. Look, we are seeing contract services up almost 10%. As Jim indicated, supply is up closer to 15%. So, do I think we could see some degree of moderation in that as we go into \u201824, the short answer is yes, I think we probably will. Has it been at what we feel like are unnaturally elevated levels over the last 18 months to 24 months, again I think the answer is yes. I think part of what our business has shown is a high degree of agility when we are faced with those to be able to come back and address them from a commercial perspective. So, I think we will continue to be able to do that. But I think to your point on are supply chains getting better, yes. Are we likely to see some easing in that dimension, probably so. Obviously, we will give you more detail on that as we come into \u201824, but at least those are some topside thoughts.\nTyler Brown: Yes. No, that\u2019s good stuff. Thank you.\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning Ward, Jim and Jennifer.\nWard Nye: Hi Michael.\nMichael Dudas: Ward, you and Jim talked in your prepared remarks, you have done a really good job of getting the leverage down and where your net debt ratios are today. And you have highlighted about portfolio optimization. So, where do you stand today relative to the optimization and looking at the pipeline for acquisitions? Is that something that might be a bit more pull forward as you look at some of the opportunities at the market that you need to serve, given you should be a pretty reasonable recovery in volumes and business as we move into \u201824 and beyond?\nWard Nye: But the short answer is I agree with you. Number one, kudos to Jim, the finance group and our operating team to find ourselves to a 2.1x leverage ratio. I mean that\u2019s nice de-levering after what had been some of the largest M&A that the company has ever done. To your point on future growth, part of what\u2019s attractive now about having a coast-to-coast business in markets that have been carefully curated by us and where we want to be is two things happen now. One, our aperture relative to bolt-on transactions has been opened considerably. And of course, bolt-on transactions, if you think about a return on investment, being able to get very quick synergies, that\u2019s really the best type of transaction you can do. But here is the glory of it. Almost any transaction we would do now is going to be a bolt-on, whether it\u2019s a single site or whether it\u2019s multiple sites. So, I think where we positioned ourselves tactically and strategically for future growth it\u2019s actually very important. I will tell you, we are engaged in a number of what we feel like are very meaningful conversations today, separate and distinct from the dialogue that\u2019s ongoing relative to our discontinued operations that I mentioned before. And the dialogues in which we are engaged are primarily, if not almost exclusively on the aggregate side. So, should you expect us to continue growing our aggregates footprint, absolutely. Will we ever surprise you, I think not, because we have largely said where we want to grow and why we want to grow there. So, do we have an appetite for it, we do. And one reason we have an appetite for it, and I mean this is a complement to our team. They are good at it. They are good at identifying businesses. They are good at the contracting phase of it. And they are good at the integration phases of it as well. So, I hope to be able to tell you at some point in the year, some good stories that we can talk about specifically in the M&A. And by that, I mean the buy side and on the sell side.\nMichael Dudas: Excellent. Ward, thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kevin Gainey of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nKevin Gainey: Good morning everyone. It\u2019s Kevin on for Adam.\nWard Nye: Okay.\nKevin Gainey: So, I wanted to maybe touch on ready-mix. It looks like it\u2019s probably the best margin since maybe 2016, I don\u2019t want to make too much of one quarter, but as far as that business, is there any structurally improvement there that maybe change things after a number of challenging years?\nWard Nye: Yes, I would say several things. One, the pricing worked well in ready-mix, number one. Number two, the ready-mix business that we have is largely a Texas ready-mix business and an Arizona ready-mix business. So number one, they tend to be warm weather states. Number two, keep in mind, particularly in Texas, we are selling aggregates to that business. We are selling cement to that business. So, about 30% of our cement is going to find its way to our own ready-mix business. We are selling degrees of our own cement in Arizona though not the same degree. So, if we look at what the drivers were, I mean you saw shipments were relatively flat. ASP was up 21%. And part of what we are seeing, and this is not a surprise, is strength in infrastructure and non-res really served to offset what had been degrees of residential softness, particularly around San Antonio and Texas. So again, you saw a very nice rise in gross profit. You saw gross margin increased 660 basis points. So again, what you are seeing is that business get back to a point that\u2019s largely consistent with the way that we told you we thought that business would work. We told you we thought the margins would be in that low to mid-teens. So, part of what we have done over time, again, I am going to use the word I used before, we have curated the business. And we really have ready-mix there for our overall enterprise. It makes the single most sense, Kevin. So, I hope that gives you an answer to your question.\nKevin Gainey: Yes. Perfect. Thank you, Ward.\nWard Nye: Kevin, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes. Just thanks for taking my follow-up question. There has been a few questions here about cement margins. I am just wondering to what extent are the cement margins benefiting from Martin\u2019s kind of unique position as a large-scale supplier of both cement and aggregates to large Texas projects and your ability to just extract maybe a synergistic margin like winning on both materials?\nWard Nye: First of all, you sly devil coming back for a second question here, David. No, look, I think your question is a really good one. I think you are right. And I think it goes back to our view of such strategic cement. Strategic cement is in a marketplace where we are the leading aggregates player. Strategic cement is where we have a notable downstream business. Strategic cement is where the market is overall built that way. And it\u2019s not close to water. That\u2019s exactly what Dallas-Fort Worth is. That\u2019s exactly what San Antonio is. So, when we go back to the way that we defined strategic cement almost 9 years ago, and what we thought we could do with the business with those attributes. The cement business is benefiting from that. And clearly, we have got a very healthy concrete business. In North Texas and Central Texas that has benefited from some large projects, for example, in South Texas, what we did with Testa [ph], what we are doing in North Texas right now on any number of large projects. So, I think they have been any number of issues, David, that have come together nicely, but I am going to add, it hasn\u2019t been by accident or happens. This has been a business that we have very carefully built and turned into something that\u2019s a very powerful aspect of who we are. It\u2019s not our aim to be a nationwide global cement player or otherwise. But an aggregates-led business with strategic cement that fits the definition that we have is what we have in Texas, and you can see what the financial results are. So, I hope that helps.\nDavid MacGregor: Thanks very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.\nWard Nye: Michelle, thanks so much for your hosting this today, and thank you all for joining today\u2019s earnings conference call. Martin Marietta\u2019s track record of success proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates led business model. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence and are confident in Martin Marietta\u2019s prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhanced shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2023 results with you in the fall. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenny. Welcome everyone and thanks for joining this quarterly teleconference. I am pleased to report Martin Marietta's exceptional performance across nearly every safety, financial and operational measure in the second quarter, which built upon our record first quarter performance. Given the overall challenging macroeconomic environment, including continued monetary policy tightening and the related residential housing slowdown, our strong quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus and resiliency of our differentiated business model. In addition to our results and consistent with our aggregates-led product strategy, we also finalized the divestiture of our Stockton, California cement import terminal in the second quarter, further enhancing our company's margin profile and improving the durability of our business through cycles. As indicated in today's earnings release, we revised our 2023 guidance to reflect the company's results from the first half of the year and our current expectations for the second half. Notably, we raised our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance to range from $2 billion to $2.1 billion or a 28% increase at the midpoint as compared with the prior year. The core assumption underpinning the adjusted EBITDA guidance is that accelerated commercial momentum will more than offset lower shipments and higher costs as we endeavor to continue managing the last 2 years of historic inflation. Further, given the typical lag effect between single-family housing starts and aggregates demand, we expect recent aggregate shipments declines will find a bottom in the third quarter of 2023. Against that backdrop, Martin Marietta achieved strong second quarter results across a number of areas, including consolidated total revenues of $1.82 billion, an 11% increase; consolidated gross profit of $560 million, a 32% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $596 million, a 25% increase; and aggregates gross profit per ton of $6.80, a 28% increase. These stellar results reflect the continued disciplined execution of our strategic plan through economic cycles. Shifting now to our second quarter shipment and pricing results, starting with aggregates. Aggregate shipments declined 5.7% as we experienced the expected lag between last year's decline in single-family housing starts and our shipments to the residential market. Predictably though, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 18.6% or 17% on a mix-adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Second quarter shipments were a record 1.1 million tons and pricing grew 21.8%. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and expect solid realization of the $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses, ready-mix concrete shipments decreased 1.7%, while pricing increased a robust 21.9%. Asphalt shipments increased 1.7% and pricing improved 7.9%. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I will turn the call over to Jim to conclude our second quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. With this year's construction season well underway, we are confident in Martin Marietta's bright prospects for the remainder of 2023. We continue to be encouraged by a number of factors that support sustainable demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy non-residential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation, including the infrastructure investment in Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects for years to come. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated from any mild-to-moderate private sector contraction. We began with infrastructure, which accounted for 36% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government, highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is again meaningfully higher year-over-year, with growth of 25% to a record $114 billion for the 12-month period ending May 31, 2023. Importantly, in addition to incoming IIJA funding, state legislatures are choosing to commit considerable investment to transportation projects. For example, Texas and North Carolina have directed portions of sales tax collections to infrastructure, while Florida is transferring general funds to augment State Department of Transportation resources. We expect this increase in public sector investment to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important often countercyclical end market. Moving now to non-residential construction, which represented 35% of our second quarter aggregate shipments. As warehouse construction has moderated from its post-COVID peak, other heavy industrial projects led by onshore manufacturing and energy continued to drive demand in this segment, accounting for the majority of total non-residential shipments. Construction spending for manufacturing in the United States has accelerated to well above record levels as the MACE seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending for 2023 is $194 billion, a 76% increase from the May 2022 value of $110 billion. Since 2021, supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act, private companies have announced over $500 billion in commitments to invest in critical sectors like semiconductors and electronics, electric vehicle and related batteries and clean energy as those projects are both economic and national security consequence. Further, the nation's aim to be the global leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning is expected to drive substantial demand for new data centers for the foreseeable future. As a result, we expect an extended cycle within the aggregates intensive heavy non-residential sector. We also remain optimistic about Martin Marietta's light non-residential end markets, where we have yet to experience any notable weakness as shipments to in-process projects continue. We are actively monitoring this portion of the segment, but expect any possible future softness to be partially offset by the relative strength of the more aggregates intensive, heavy non-residential project pipeline. Moving to residential. Shipments to this segment accounted for 24% of total aggregate shipments this past quarter. Given the structural housing deficit in key Martin Marietta markets, we correctly anticipated that the affordability-driven residential slowdown would be short-lived. Accordingly, we are encouraged by recent public homebuilder sentiment and single-family starts data, which are indicative of a near-term bottoming and inflection point. The significant underbuilding over the last decade, coupled with existing homeowners reluctance to abandon their low rate mortgages, is exacerbating the housing deficit, thus available home inventory is being disproportionately driven by new home construction, a notable trend that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting second quarter performance provides outstanding momentum and a solid foundation for the balance of the year. As a result, we are confident in our ability to achieve our raised 2023 financial guidance. We believe our most recent results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model and our team's steadfast commitment to health and safety, commercial and operational excellence, sustainable business practices and the execution of our SOAR 2025 initiatives will support our success. We remain focused on building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions. Good morning, Trey. Happy to, Trey. Thank you for the question. So first, you are right, it was weather in Texas. We had 20 weather-impacted days this quarter as opposed to 16 in the last quarter. I think what that does tell you is the essence of what you asked is right. That is cement because some of it is going to vertical construction as opposed to horizontal construction can actually weather better than aggregates can or asphalt can, because they are both going down literally on the ground in most instances. What I would say relative to the business, number one, it is very durable in Texas. If we go back to our definition of strategic cement, the business we have in Dallas and the business we have in San Antonio fits it perfectly. If we think about Texas as the market all by itself, North Texas is the single healthiest market in Texas. So if we look at the way Midlothian continues to perform and it's performing very well. That was the single strongest cement performer that we had. That said, Hunter was a very solid performer as well. So if we are looking at overall volumes at 1.1 million tons, the important thing to remember is markets largely sold out. So in essence, short of that capital project coming through next year, we are basically running at capacity. So having a cement business in Texas with the biggest piece of it in Dallas-Fort Worth, running at capacity is a really good start for a cement business. The second part of your question was relative to the midyear, we have announced a $10 per ton midyear price increase in cement in Texas. We think we are going to get very good traction on that, so more to come on that as we come toward Q3, but again, a very solid performance by our team. They continue operationally to run that business extraordinarily well. Again, if you are looking at what the pricing has done. Q2 saw pricing up 21.8%, even if you look at mix adjusted, it was still over 21%. But as Jim outlined in his prepared remarks, we continue to see in different parts of the business, degrees of inflation. So part of what we are trying to do with our pricing is stay at least even or try to do some catch-up on that. So Trey, I hope that's responsive. Thank you, Trey. Stanley, thanks for that question. So a couple of things. One, if we think about what we outlined is important. We talked about value over volume. If we're looking at price cost spread, we're 200 bps ahead of that today. So I think from that perspective, where we thought we would be. If we're looking at bringing operational excellence to the enterprise, and we're looking at the best safety metric rates at this time of year we've ever seen. If we're looking at continued throughput and tons produced per working man hour, they continue to go up. But if we also take a look at what we said we would do relative to growing our business, the short answer is we're ahead of plan on that. If in year 1 in 2021, we bought Tiller and Lehigh West. We spent year 2 really last year and the year before, doing portfolio shaping and really getting our leverage back down to the areas that we told you that we would. So keep in mind, in a post West Coast world, we are modestly over 3x levered. Today, we're down to 2.1x. So when we're looking at our range of debt to EBITDA to 2.5x, we're actually the lower end of that. And then I think importantly, if we're looking at the pipeline that we have today to continue growing our business, it's a very attractive pipeline. And I think what's important in that, Stanley, is it's attractive in the areas that we've continued to say are most important to our business, and that's back to the notion of an aggregates-led business. So again, if we're measuring where we were from the perspective of, we said we thought during that 5-year period, we could double our market cap. Math tells me we're like 60% plus there. and we're about halfway through. So again, tactically, I like where we sit. If we look strategically on how we think it's coming together. Look, I think at the end of the day, the plan works. So thank you so much for the question. You bet. Good morning, Kathryn, thanks for the question, too. So look, if we're looking at really what the drivers are, clearly, what we're seeing relative to average selling price is the single largest driver that we have right now. If we're looking at Q2 in aggregates up 18.6%, a really nice performance, obviously, in cement. We talked about that over 20% ready-mix, tracking the same thing. These are all important points relative to the revised EBITDA guidance. And it does give you a sense that in today's world, pricing is actually considerably more powerful than volume is. And I think that's, to me, in so many respects, part of what's important to underline. To that end, if we're looking at the volume and we're seeing what some of the differences are several things are worth noting. One, relative to volume, we think in the quarter, we lost about 1 million tons simply due to weather. If you were here in the Mid-Atlantic, what you saw is the second half of June was, frankly, a washout. It rained nearly every day. So when the Carolinas and Georgia are feeling that we feel that on volume. I think importantly, too, if we're looking at value over volume and what we think that cost us relative to volume for the quarter, we think that was probably about 1 million tons. And by the way, we think that was probably a pretty good trade. Equally, if we're looking at what Jim and I both spoke to in our prepared comments and that is with respect to the residential market. Again, we think housing itself has found bottom, but we tend to lag in that on the stone finds us waiting new subdivisions. So we think we're actually troughing in that as we sit here probably today going into the third quarter, we think that probably cost us about 0.5 million tons. So again, if you're looking at what the drivers are going to be, will price be the disproportionate driver? Yes. Have we given up some volume on occasion intentionally and purposely because we feel like really holding firm on some of the pricing that we feel like is fair, is the right thing to do relative to our shareholders? We do. And then to the last part of your question relative to how different markets look, here's what I would tell you. The Southeast remains strong. If we're looking at the Carolinas, if we're looking at Atlanta, if we're looking at coastal markets in the East, they continue to be quite good. If we're looking in Texas, in many respects, the results speak for themselves. But in particular, Dallas-Fort Worth in the North and Austin are strong. San Antonio and Houston are feeling degrees of residential weakness. I don't think that's a surprise any place. If we're looking at Colorado, Colorado had a very wet June, as I mentioned, it was the wettest June on record. But if we're looking in California and Arizona, here's where we see really strong demand in Phoenix. We see strong demand in Southern California. The places that are a little bit weaker, it's a little bit weaker in San Francisco Bay Area. We thought it would be coming into the year. It's a little bit weaker in portions of the Midwest. Again, that's a cold weather market that in many respects, it's just starting to hit its stride right now. But modestly weaker there. But overall, if we're doing a heat map across our markets in the United States, given how intentional we've been in building our business in areas that continue to have good population inflows, very good public spending and good private growth. We're seeing better markets than not. And again, that's not a big surprise to us, Kathryn. So again, I think I hit the points that you wanted to be raised, but I hope that helps. Thank you, Kathryn. David, good morning. Thanks for the question. Again, if I go through and telling them look, I think weather was 1 million. I think value over volume is another 1 million. I think residential market softening was probably 500,000. I think in some instances, frankly, just having availability of certain sizes was probably somewhere north of 500,000. So again, you start telling those up, you're getting a lot closer to 3 million than 2 million by just some quick math. If I think about really what it looks like for the rest of the year, we did our best to try to capture in the revised guidance, how we thought that was going to play I do think it's important to reemphasize what I said in the commentary. Look, I think we're likely because of housing and the timing on housing defined volume in Q3, the most challenged of the year. I think so. Do I think we're likely to see an inflection in 4. I do in large measure because last year's 4 was not a particularly compelling fourth quarter. And again, as we see the build go through 3, I think we've taken a very measured view. And of course, it's easier to do it in late July than it is in late February on how the year is going. So I think we've captured pretty well how we think volume is going to play out for the rest of the year. And the other thing that I think is worth keeping in mind, David, is the way pricing is working now and how we see that working for the rest of the year. Because keep in mind, part of what happens at this time of year, as we report Q2 is the central part of the United States that tend to be cold weather markets, but equally don't tend to be as high priced markets as some of the ones that we have on the East Coast simply rolled in. So what do I mean by that? Aggregates cost more in Charlotte than they do in Cincinnati. So remember, you're always going to have a little bit of an optical headwind relative to pricing at half year. So again, as we think about volume, we feel like we're in a perfectly good place on volume, and we think it's going to build going into 4. We really like the way pricing has worked. And keep in mind, we took so much of our pricing and accelerated that first price increase from January and April, almost exclusively to January. So you had a number of different themes that are in play that in some respects, the market is seen for the very first time in this quarter, at least through an annual snapshot. But David, what I try to do is give you a sense of how we think volumes will build, how we think the pricing is going to come back to support that. And I think it's important to note that we saw midyear price increases in over half of our markets. And I think if somebody had thought that's what Martin Marietta is going to see when we came out with our guidance in February, I think they would have been very pleased with that. an I know we are as a management team. I think the traction rate will actually be good on the midyears. And as I'm sitting here looking at the guide, honestly, if I'm wondering if there is some place that we might be a little bit light on it, it may be on that pricing guide. I think the pricing is going to actually look really good for the year. And I think we can exit the year probably in some instances, pretty close to a 20 figure this year, David. Thank you. Good morning, Jerry. Yes, Jerry, that's a great question. I don't want to go into specific details on that yet because, obviously, we will come out early next year and give good guidance for 2024. But I think several things are worth thinking, Jerry. One, do I think it will give us a nice carryover into \u201824? The answer is yes. Do I think we will end up seeing good price increases in January that will help build on that? The answer to that again is yes. So I think what we're seeing is a pricing cycle right now that's going to be better than the pricing cycle that you've typically seen even separate and apart from what has been a pretty high inflationary market. In other words, if you go back and look at what aggregates were doing at a normal rhythm and cadence even prior to the last, say, 1.5 years. I think what you can expect going forward is going to outkick that coverage that you would have historically seen. So again, do I think midyear help with that? I do. Do I think the price increases that will come back in, in January will help build upon that? Yes. And do I think we're going to continue to see good sticking on the midyears that we put in place this year. And the answer to that is, again, a resounding, yes, Jerry. So I think from an outlook perspective, pricing has always been something that people have looked to Martin Marietta and said it broadly works. And I think what they are going to come to the conclusion of is it's going to work in the future even better than it has in the past. And I think that's saying something. So I guess I just want to make sure that my writing was clear in some instances, maybe wasn't. What we're saying is we've seen, since we bought that business, ASPs up around $4.50 a ton in that marketplace. And by the way, that was a marketplace that \u2013 and we've talked about it, Jerry, it was below Martin Marietta corporate average in a state that typically sees higher pricing. So seeing aggregate up since we've acquired that business about $4.50 a ton. We think given the barriers to entry, we think with the reserve depletion plays at the California sees generally, that's a very responsible place for us to be on moving that. The other thing that I'll tell you is as we're sitting here now, we're expecting probably another $2 a ton when we start getting closer to January 2024. So just as we've seen in different markets, when we bring the commercial philosophy to a business over an extended period of time, the pricing and the commercial aspects of the business tend to work quite well. And again, I haven't been surprised by anything that we've seen in California, and I'm pretty pleased with where that business is going. And the other piece of it, Jerry, that you've watched very carefully is our team has been superb at managing what we've had in discontinued operations since we bought the business. So as you can tell, there is very little left now in disc ops. And again, we've been very intentional in skinning that business down to what we do, what we do best, very focused and our work there, frankly, is almost done and the commercial aspects of clearly work. So Jerry, I hope that helps. Let me ask Jim to respond to that. So what you're going to hear is energy is a good guy. And then there is some other things that are a bit of a headwind. Jerry, thanks so much. Take care. And to that end, part of what the team has done so well in Texas. They have been focused on reliability. They have been focused on utilization. And they have also been focused on making sure commercially again, they are getting the right value for that product. And remember, that marketplace is largely sold out. So that certainly helps us. So then coming back as we will here over the next year, with the Midlothian FM 7 project and adding much-needed tonnage to that on top of reliability on top of utilization should put that business in an even more enviable position. And part of what I think we can be so proud of as a team has been the evolution of what that cement businesses look like in North Texas since the 2014, 2015 time frame. It's consistently gotten better, and we think it can continue to do just that, Garik. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the call, Keith. So, as we just think through the way that we think that's going to look, we think infrastructure for the year is likely to be up mid-single digits. And previously, we had been at mid-single to high-single. So again, we continue to see this roll out. We think, particularly as we get towards the 3 and 4, and remember, we said we thought this would be a back half loaded from an infrastructure perspective. We see that continuing to play the same way. Again, when we came out early in the year, we said we thought single-family would be down low-double digits, I think that's exactly what we are going to see, so no big surprise there. Again, if we look at non-res for the quarter that just ended, we had a basic breakdown of 55% heavy, 45% light. And what we actually think we are going to see is that heavy piece of it is actually going to get heavier. So, as we watch that rollout and we see some of these large manufacturing jobs come in, again, we think that's likely to be overall for the year, probably down mid-single digits. So, we do think looking at the end users, infrastructure is the one that's really starting to move at this point. And we think the primary volume play is that switches that we talked about a minute ago, and that is where we are with housing found, we believe, having found bottom, but shipments not yet having caught up with that. So, Keith, I hope that helps you think about the end users and at least the way we are looking at it on a percentage basis. You bet. Just one quick note to that. As we said, the transition to PLC or Type 1 does give us modestly more volume this year as compared to last. But it's not a huge mover. We are talking, again, mid-single digits on a percentage basis. Thank you, Phil. Timna, thank you so much for that. So, I guess I would say several things. One, if we are looking at domestic manufacturing and energy and data centers. So, those are items one, two and three on Slide 11. What I would say is, number one, we capture all of those as heavy non-res. So, again, in today's world, probably 55% of our non-res book of business. Number two, if we compare that to what maybe like commercial, retail and hospitality would look like, I have to tell you, it's probably 7x to 9x more intensive than a single-standing big-box store maybe. So, if you are looking at the overall square footage, number one, and you are looking at the nature of the construction, number two, meaning what do the roads look like going in, they are almost all concrete. What did the walls look like, they are almost all concrete. What did the floors look like, they are concrete. And then if we throw a bone to our Magnesia Specialties business, oftentimes, the roofing is TPO. So, these large domestic manufacturing and data centers are almost Martin Marietta envelope. So obviously, energy does not because it's typically open. But if we also think about what's going on with those very large energy projects along the Gulf Coast of the United States, Again, the notices to proceed are coming on those \u2013 the tonnage that's required on those is very significant tonnage, and we are starting to see movement in lending of those contracts. So again, if we look at 11 and we look at the outlook for those top three that shows full green. And we look at the outlook for the lighter piece of it that's showing yellow. It doesn't mean that those that are in yellow were not going forward, they are. It just doesn't have the same rate and pace. But what we have at the top of the page tends to be some of the more aggregates-intensive. And again, from a percentage perspective, I would say oftentimes 7x to 9x more aggregate intensive than other light non-res activity. No, I appreciate it. And in the prepared remarks, like we said that we haven't seen even on the light side of it, that big a change yet. And we are watching it and we are sensitive to what could happen because of the way interest rates are moving because that tends to be something pay that's more interest rate-sensitive. Obviously, some of that was driving simply because of COVID, the way that people are shopping and the way some of that work. Obviously, Amazon was very clear that they said they were pulling back on some of that. The fact is there were others who frankly had some catch-up that they needed to do. And I think one reason we haven't felt as acutely as others, Timna, is how intentional we have been in building on corridors. So, if you look at the Martin Marietta footprint, you are going to see I-5 as a major corridor. You can see I-25 and the Rockies is a major corridor. You are going to see I-35 through the middle of Texas is a major corridor, not to mention 85 and 95 on the East. And then another component of it that I think is important, we are the largest shipper of stone by rail in the United States. So, we will ship almost 2x what our closest competitor will by rail. The reason I mentioned that is distribution up and down rail networks, we think is going to be pretty notable as well. So, when we go through those and you see yellow in areas that you otherwise might think based on commentary, it might be trending towards red. I think a lot of that's driven by the where and the how that we are moving our stone. Thank you, Timna. Hi Tyler. And I think, Tyler, going back to your other question on supply chain and how that's working. Look, we are seeing contract services up almost 10%. As Jim indicated, supply is up closer to 15%. So, do I think we could see some degree of moderation in that as we go into \u201824, the short answer is yes, I think we probably will. Has it been at what we feel like are unnaturally elevated levels over the last 18 months to 24 months, again I think the answer is yes. I think part of what our business has shown is a high degree of agility when we are faced with those to be able to come back and address them from a commercial perspective. So, I think we will continue to be able to do that. But I think to your point on are supply chains getting better, yes. Are we likely to see some easing in that dimension, probably so. Obviously, we will give you more detail on that as we come into \u201824, but at least those are some topside thoughts. Hi Michael. But the short answer is I agree with you. Number one, kudos to Jim, the finance group and our operating team to find ourselves to a 2.1x leverage ratio. I mean that's nice de-levering after what had been some of the largest M&A that the company has ever done. To your point on future growth, part of what's attractive now about having a coast-to-coast business in markets that have been carefully curated by us and where we want to be is two things happen now. One, our aperture relative to bolt-on transactions has been opened considerably. And of course, bolt-on transactions, if you think about a return on investment, being able to get very quick synergies, that's really the best type of transaction you can do. But here is the glory of it. Almost any transaction we would do now is going to be a bolt-on, whether it's a single site or whether it's multiple sites. So, I think where we positioned ourselves tactically and strategically for future growth it's actually very important. I will tell you, we are engaged in a number of what we feel like are very meaningful conversations today, separate and distinct from the dialogue that's ongoing relative to our discontinued operations that I mentioned before. And the dialogues in which we are engaged are primarily, if not almost exclusively on the aggregate side. So, should you expect us to continue growing our aggregates footprint, absolutely. Will we ever surprise you, I think not, because we have largely said where we want to grow and why we want to grow there. So, do we have an appetite for it, we do. And one reason we have an appetite for it, and I mean this is a complement to our team. They are good at it. They are good at identifying businesses. They are good at the contracting phase of it. And they are good at the integration phases of it as well. So, I hope to be able to tell you at some point in the year, some good stories that we can talk about specifically in the M&A. And by that, I mean the buy side and on the sell side. Thank you. Okay. Yes, I would say several things. One, the pricing worked well in ready-mix, number one. Number two, the ready-mix business that we have is largely a Texas ready-mix business and an Arizona ready-mix business. So number one, they tend to be warm weather states. Number two, keep in mind, particularly in Texas, we are selling aggregates to that business. We are selling cement to that business. So, about 30% of our cement is going to find its way to our own ready-mix business. We are selling degrees of our own cement in Arizona though not the same degree. So, if we look at what the drivers were, I mean you saw shipments were relatively flat. ASP was up 21%. And part of what we are seeing, and this is not a surprise, is strength in infrastructure and non-res really served to offset what had been degrees of residential softness, particularly around San Antonio and Texas. So again, you saw a very nice rise in gross profit. You saw gross margin increased 660 basis points. So again, what you are seeing is that business get back to a point that's largely consistent with the way that we told you we thought that business would work. We told you we thought the margins would be in that low to mid-teens. So, part of what we have done over time, again, I am going to use the word I used before, we have curated the business. And we really have ready-mix there for our overall enterprise. It makes the single most sense, Kevin. So, I hope that gives you an answer to your question. Kevin, thank you. First of all, you sly devil coming back for a second question here, David. No, look, I think your question is a really good one. I think you are right. And I think it goes back to our view of such strategic cement. Strategic cement is in a marketplace where we are the leading aggregates player. Strategic cement is where we have a notable downstream business. Strategic cement is where the market is overall built that way. And it's not close to water. That's exactly what Dallas-Fort Worth is. That's exactly what San Antonio is. So, when we go back to the way that we defined strategic cement almost 9 years ago, and what we thought we could do with the business with those attributes. The cement business is benefiting from that. And clearly, we have got a very healthy concrete business. In North Texas and Central Texas that has benefited from some large projects, for example, in South Texas, what we did with Testa [ph], what we are doing in North Texas right now on any number of large projects. So, I think they have been any number of issues, David, that have come together nicely, but I am going to add, it hasn't been by accident or happens. This has been a business that we have very carefully built and turned into something that's a very powerful aspect of who we are. It's not our aim to be a nationwide global cement player or otherwise. But an aggregates-led business with strategic cement that fits the definition that we have is what we have in Texas, and you can see what the financial results are. So, I hope that helps. Thank you, David. Michelle, thanks so much for your hosting this today, and thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's track record of success proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates led business model. We continue to strive for safety, commercial and operational excellence and are confident in Martin Marietta's prospects to continue driving attractive growth and enhanced shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2023 results with you in the fall. As always, we are available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward and good day to everyone. The Building Materials business posted record second quarter revenues of $1.74 billion, an 11.6% increase over last year's comparable period and a quarterly gross profit record of $536.1 million, a 34.3% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 20.7% relative to the prior year period resulting in a quarterly record of $370.9 million as strong pricing growth and lower diesel fuel expenses more than offset lower shipments and increased non-energy-related costs. Our Texas cement business also continued its track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.7% to $197.7 million and gross profit increased 84% to $93.3 million. As previously discussed, our Midlothian, Texas plant is installing a new finish mill that we expect to be finished in the third quarter of 2024. Upon completion, the new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today's sold-out Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace. This project will achieve its first major milestone this month as our new cement titles will begin loading customer trucks. The new silos and load-out system are dramatically improving customer service by reducing load-out cycle times by as much as 45 to 60 minutes per truck during periods of peak shipping. In addition, this project has increased cement storage capacity by over 60%. The process of converting our construction cement customers from Type 1, Type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as Type 1L is now complete at both our Midlothian and Hunter, Texas plants. We expect the Type 1L conversion to provide additional production capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022 and helped reduce our carbon footprint. Our ready-mix concrete revenues increased 19.7% to $271.4 million and gross profit increased 142.3% to $35.4 million, driven primarily by strong pricing gains in the quarter, more than offsetting higher upstream raw material costs. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 11.7% to $240.9 million and gross profit increased 37.9% to $36.5 million due to pricing improvement, coupled with lower bitumen costs as compared to the prior period. Magnesia Specialties revenues totaled $80.5 million in the second quarter, in line with the prior year quarter and gross profit increased 13% to $27.7 million. Notably, gross margin increased 440 basis points from the prior year quarter to 34.4%, driven by pricing growth and moderating energy expenses. As a general matter, energy costs are down from last year's highs and have now seemingly stabilized. Non-energy costs continue to grow at rates well above historical averages and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of this year. That said, expected midyear price increases should serve to offset the expected cost inflation. During the quarter, we returned $116 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 178,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $422 per share in the second quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.5 billion to shareholders through combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.1x, within our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x. This balance sheet strength gives us ample flexibility to continue investing in the business and pursuing accretive acquisition opportunities, while at the same time, extending our long record of returning capital to Martin Marietta's shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward. Yes. No, the non-energy cost inflation is still with us, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, but things that are also above and beyond that, we did ship more tons via rail this quarter and the rate per ton on those rails shipped stone was higher as well. So that had a disproportionate effect. And again, it's only quarter so it's an outsized effect but that was a big piece of it as well as additional repairs costs that we incurred in the quarter. So those are the two things that will probably help drive that number up a bit, Jerry. Yes. Jerry, it's Jim \u2013 Garik, sorry. It definitely has changed. I think the margins you're seeing today are not anomalous. I would expect them to continue. The only thing that might affect that is if we saw a spike in natural gas prices, of course. But that's \u2013 I would say at this point, it's performing where we like it at. We think there is other ways to improve it further down the road, but I would view today's margins as repeatable and enduring. No. It's \u2013 well, to answer your first question, there is not really any one-time good guy in this quarter for cement. So, that's why when I answered the question earlier, I think it's enduring. Again, there is no anomalous things happening this quarter. So, we can expect these margins to repeat. As it relates to the cement storage capacity, that helps us throughout the year that we will going forward, it's in our guidance. And then the, of course, finish mill seven to when it comes online next year, that will be another boost to our capacity and our volumes. But our guidance number includes those volumes at this point for this year. Yes. The first part of the answer to your question is yes, midyears are in for both agg and cement in the guidance. On energy, it's, we use, again, really late Q2 energy levels and assume that continues for the rest of the year. So, that's sort of the foundation for the guidance. Now of course, oil prices have come up a bit since then, but we don't know if that's going to stick or not, but that's how we think about it. I would say, in total, this guidance versus prior guidance, energy is a bit of a larger tailwind than we thought. Non-energy costs were a bit of a larger headwind than we thought they kind of net out, leaving us with, the upside is largely price driven, and some of that's taken back with lower volumes. That's how I would think about it in the broad buckets, Phil. Sure. So, I would say that on the non-energy inflation front, high-single digits is what we are looking at for the rest of the year. I do expect that to taper a bit as we go into the year, into next year, and I would expect it to be lower next year, more closer to normal. But \u2013 and so from that perspective, there may be a tailwind. But the repairs expense that we are incurring this year, I wouldn't view it as just for the quarter that is going to cause much of a comparison good or bad for next year, if that was the \u2013 if that was the answer to your question. Thank you, Tyler."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jennifer Park, Martin Marietta's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jennifer, you may begin.\nJennifer Park: Thank you. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Ward Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation, after which Ward will conclude with market trends and our outlook for 2023. A question-and-answer session will follow. [Operator Instructions].  I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jenny. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that this year is off to a very strong start for Martin Marietta with first quarter records by nearly every measure. Given our focus on operating safely and responsibly, we're especially pleased that total and lost time incident rates were down 21% and 50%, respectively, in the first quarter. The exceptional quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus on commercial and operational excellence and the resiliency of our differentiated business model that separates us from others in our industry. We continue to adhere to a value-over-volume approach, focusing on an aggregates-led product strategy and carefully expanding and honing our service footprint, which today is national in scope. In brief, the results we've reported over the recent past, including the first quarter results announced today, are a tribute to our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan and gives us confidence that we will deliver 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, consistent with the high end of our previously announced guidance range. As is common practice, we will revisit our guidance more formally at [indiscernible] year. As for the first quarter, our product demand remained robust. We experienced a modest decline in aggregate shipments as historically wet weather in California was partially offset by a mild winter in the Southeast. However, aggregates pricing momentum continued to build with a 12.8% sequential increase driven by the carryover effects of our 2022 inflation management actions and by broad acceptance of our January 1, 2023 increases, which were pulled forward from April 1 in the vast majority of our markets. These combined shipments and pricing results demonstrate the relative price and elasticity of aggregate demand where customer service and availability of quality in materials tend to be of greater importance than product cost. Our intentional approach to capacity expansion investments at key facilities across our footprint has positioned us well to better serve our customers during this period of high product demand across many of our locations, including markets in the Southeast and Texas. Now let's turn to our financial results. We established a number of first quarter records for Martin Marietta, including consolidated total revenues of $1.35 billion, a 10% increase; consolidated gross profit of $303 million, a 94% increase; diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.16, a 454% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $324 million, a 64% increase; and $5.70 aggregates gross profit per ton, a 134% increase. These results demonstrate the advantages of our value over volume commercial strategy, which was paramount to offsetting continued albeit moderating inflationary pressures. That said, the April OPEC+ production cuts were broadly unexpected and are likely to put upward pressure on fuel expenses throughout the remainder of the year, which tends to flow through to other cost categories. As such, our teams are actively advising customers of midyear price increases, which we anticipate will be more widely accepted and larger in scope and magnitude than we were initially considering a few months ago. Longer term, Martin Marietta is well positioned to benefit from what is expected to be an increasingly favorable and extended pricing cycle. Let's now turn to our first quarter operating performance beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments decreasing only 300,000 tons despite an approx but 1 million-ton shipment decline in weather-impacted California. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 22.6% or 19.6% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions particularly in the Dallas/Fort Worth [indiscernible]. Yet largely due to wet and cold weather to start the year, first quarter shipments declined 6.8%. Importantly, we delivered pricing growth of 32.2% more than offsetting the effect of lower weather-impacted shipments. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and accordingly, have announced a $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready mixed concrete shipments decreased 37.1% and pricing increased 20.2%. As a reminder, our first quarter 2023 ready mixed concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested nearly 13 months ago on April 1, 2022, impacting the comparability to the prior year quarter. Asphalt shipments decreased 25.1%, driven primarily by wet weather in California and Arizona. Pricing improved 9.9% following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our first quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The Building Materials business posted first quarter revenues of $1.27 billion, a 10.1% increase over last year's comparable period and a first quarter gross profit record of $276 million, a 99.4% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 131.7% relative to the prior year, resulting in a first quarter record of $238 million. Aggregate gross margin improved 1,250 basis points to 26.1% as strong pricing growth more than offset modestly lower shipments and continued inflationary pressure impacting most cost categories. Aggregates gross margin also benefited from geographic shipment mix, which reflected a larger contribution from the higher-margin Southeast markets. Geographic mix is expected to normalize over the balance of the year. Our Texas cement business delivered record first quarter top and bottom line results, continuing its recent track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.9% to $169 million, while gross profit increased 75.4% to $47 million. Importantly, execution of our disciplined commercial strategy drove gross margin expansion of 860 basis points to 28% as pricing gains and normalization of natural gas expenses more than offset lower operating leverage and higher raw materials and maintenance costs. As we shared previously, our Midlothian, Texas plant has several initiatives underway to increase production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill that we expect to complete in the third quarter of 2024. The new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today's nearly sold out marketplace. At both our Midlothian and Hunter Texas plants, the process of converting our construction cement customers from type 1, type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as type 1L, is substantially complete. We expect those efforts to provide additional capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022. Our ready mixed concrete revenue declined 24.4% to $220 million and gross profit declined 48.9% to $11 million driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations last April, impacting prior year comparability. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 2.1% to $58 million as increased pricing offset weather-impacted shipments in California and Arizona. Consistent with its typical seasonality, this business posted a $20.5 million gross loss as the Minnesota operations are inactive during the first quarter given that market's late spring start to the construction season. Ideally, most asphalt installations occur when both ground and air temperatures are between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Magnesia Specialties generated record first quarter revenues of $83 million an 8.4% increase. Despite top line growth, gross profit declined 2.7% to $25 million due to higher supplies and contract services expenses, resulting in a 330 basis point decline and gross margin to 30%. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, which emphasizes responsible growth through acquisitions, reinvestment in our business operations and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $117 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 204,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $368 per share in the first quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.4x, within our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. We like Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we begin this year with great promise. We continue to experience healthy customer backlogs and are encouraged by a number of factors that support near, medium and long-term demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated. We'll start with infrastructure, which accounted for 32% of first quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government highway bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is meaningfully higher year-over-year with growth of 16% to a record $104 billion for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2023. Importantly, state Departments of Transportation, or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states are well positioned from a readiness and resource perspective to utilize the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. Also late last year, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package, which included the Cornyn - Padilla Amendment, allowing states and local municipalities to allocate unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. This amendment alone is estimated to provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding to Martin Marietta's top 10 states. We expect this step change in public sector investment stemming from a number of historic legislative actions to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important, often countercyclical end market. Moving now to nonresidential construction, this quarter's largest end-use representing 38% of our aggregate shipments. Heavy industrial projects led by energy, onshore manufacturing and data centers continue to drive demand in the segment accounting for the majority of total nonresidential shipments. The large project pipeline remains robust. As an example, estimated aggregates requirements for key Gulf Coast petrochemical projects have increased by over 33% since our last earnings report. The aggregates intensity of these Gulf Coast projects is immense. And importantly, we have the production capacity and the long-haul logistics capabilities to supply specification products to these significant projects in a timely manner. In addition to large petrochemical facilities, electric vehicle and related battery plants, semiconductor and other critical product domestic manufacturing projects will be supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and Ships Act, resulting in an extended cycle with the aggregate-intensive, heavy nonresidential sector. With respect to the light nonresidential end market, we've yet to experience any notable weakness in this segment as shipments due in-process projects continue. With that said, new projects may have more difficulty accessing capital if commercial lending conditions meaningfully tighten. As such, we expect a slowdown in product shipments to the light nonresidential sector later this year. Residential shipments accounted for 25% of total aggregate shipments this quarter, reflecting a modest 2.6% decline from the prior year as resilient multifamily construction, partially offset the single-family affordability air pocket. Importantly, recent public homebuilder sentiment has been notably upbeat with respect to single-family housing, and we have observed recent positive data indicative of a near-term bottoming in certain of our [indiscernible] markets. Longer term, the structural housing deficit resulting from a decade of underbuilding is expected to drive a base level of demand for single-family homes across key Martin Marietta geographies for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting first quarter performance provides excellent momentum going into the balance of the year. As a result, we're confident in our ability to achieve the high end of our previously announced 2023 financial guidance range and navigate the current macroeconomic backdrop. Taking a broader view, we believe that our financial results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model as we continue along our path of building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Guys, amazing quarter. Was there anything -- maybe it's a question for Jim, but was there anything that specifically helped Q1 aggregates margins? And how are you thinking about aggregates margins as we move into the middle of the year?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. The main answer to the question is ASP growth. That carried a lot of the weight, and it was just obviously a phenomenal performance this year. So that really is the answer. And of course, that's going to carry through into the subsequent quarters as well. That sticks, as you know. So no real changes or unusual items on the cost side but ASO did the [indiscernible] work. Plus, as you know, we advanced pricing increases from April 1 into January 1 successfully this year, and that had a big impact as well.\nWard Nye: Adam, one thing I'll add to that too to keep in mind, what we've said on pricing so far this year does not take into account the midyears that we think we're going to have in place this year. You heard me speak to them in the prepared remarks, we think we see more mid-years. And we think we see higher midyears coming in this year than we thought we saw even in February. And so I think there are a couple of different components as we think about the margins going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.\nKathryn Thompson: And I appreciate the color that you gave previously on pricing. And tagging into that and just a bigger picture question. When we look at -- for big trends that are impacting the U.S. reshoring, near shoring, population shift, increasing environmental focus and then government support through IIJA, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. When you look at those 4 factors, how does Martin Marietta win in this? And what does that mean for pricing realistically in the mid- to long term?\nWard Nye: Kathryn, thanks for your question. To your question, as we think about pricing and we think about markets, I think several things. One, Kathryn, what you said I agree with. I sum up much of what you said in these words, so I think we're looking at what can be a manufacturing renaissance in the United States. The fact is we as a nation has to get back to building things. And what we're going to see is a nice combination of public spending relative to infrastructure or I should say, investment. We're going to see a lot more manufacturing in the United States, whether it's CHIPS or otherwise. And we're already seeing a nice burgeoning growth in energy. So let's take those 3 things and then step back away from it and think about the where. And I think that's where Martin Marietta is going to be uniquely positioned to win, as you said, going through this because as we think about the position that we've built in the Eastern United States along the I-5, I-95, I-40 corridor, where we are in the central U.S. along the I-35 corridor in Texas, which remember that corridor in Texas all by itself has more people than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If you look at the slowest -- I mean, excuse me, the smallest mega region, but fastest growing up and down the I-25 corridor in Colorado, again, we have a very attractive position up and down I-25 where a lot of people are coming in. And now we have to position up and down the I-4 corridor in California as well. So I do think the commercial aspect of what we're doing now and the commercial aspect of what we're doing going forward will be very attractive. But I think the way that we have very intentionally built out this business in mega regions in the United States trading out of areas that were slower growth into areas that are faster growth and will be that way for the long term is going to make the difference. Similarly, keep in mind, we positioned ourselves in states that are in very good shape from a DOT perspective, and we think that matters a lot. So if we're looking at public spend, which we think it's likely to be the single biggest driver of our business over the next several years, keep in mind, 1/3 of the $110 billion in the IIJA that are going to roads and bridges, a full 1/3 of that is going to our top 10 states. So we talk about housing a lot of times just generally, and it's all about location. I would tell you this business, too, is about location. And that location will drive volumes and that location will also drive the pricing. So Kathryn, I hope that gives you a good snapshot of how we look at it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.\nTrey Grooms: So first, just as a point of clarity, you mentioned, Ward, that your guidance doesn't include maybe your increases, I know for sure, in aggregates. But is that also the case for the $10 cement price increase that you just talked about?\nWard Nye: Yes, Trey, it is. So again, we've communicated with our customers in April that we're looking for a $10 a ton increase at half year. And again, that is not yet included in our guidance, which we're saying we're going to revisit more formally at half year.\nTrey Grooms: Okay. Ward, I wanted to ask about your Tehachapi cement plant since the FTC recently put that deal to the sidelines. And just would love to get some color from you on maybe your expectations for that asset going forward.\nWard Nye: Happy to respond to that. Thank you, Trey. Yes, it was interesting when the termination of that transaction with CalPortland was announced, we actually had a good bit of incoming, and that was not a surprise to us. So we've heard from a number of parties expressing interest in that asset as you saw from our release today. We've also transacted and sold the import cement business in California at Stockton. So again, consistent with our view of what is strategic cement, strategic cement for us is that wonderful cement business that you've heard about in Texas. We will continue to move forward with the process relative to Tehachapi. We feel confident that we will get very attractive value for that. And we feel confident we will transact on that this year. So that's the way we're looking at that right now, Trey.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.\nStanley Elliott: Congratulations on the strong start to the year. I guess, kind of sticking on the Texas cement market, it's certainly been a differentiator for you all. Maybe can you speak to some of the confidence or some of the conversations you're having around the second increase with pricing up, what, like 30% year-over-year? And then also kind of the health of the market and the ability to absorb the additional production on the PLC side. And then finally, maybe expectations around cost there?\nWard Nye: Stanley, thank you so much for the question. So if we really think about what we're looking at from a volume perspective in that state, it's probably going to be around 4.2 million tons this year. Keep in mind, the need for cement in Texas is far greater than the ability to produce it domestically is in Texas today. So number one, you start with that market fundamental, and that's a very attractive place to be. As you know, the largest portion of our cement business is in North Texas. It's led by our Midlothian plant. So as we indicated for the quarter, volumes were down 6.8% overall, largely due to weather. But if we're looking at North Texas, they were down about 1.6%. So again, biggest single piece of our business in Texas remains very robust. Relative to the pricing conversations that we're having with customers, they're aware of where we're going. They're aware of the cost inputs that we continue to see in portions of our business, particularly relative to supplies, materials, those types of things. So as we're sitting here today, again, we've recognized the vast majority of the price increase that we put in place relative to January 1. We're anticipating success on the one that we're looking at on July 1 as well. And we think the overall position of the Texas market -- and keeping in mind a lot of the infrastructure in that state is concrete, most of the roads in Texas are concrete roads and about half of our cement finds its way to infrastructure. So I think when you take the way that state is literally built and where our positions are in Central and North Texas: number one, we feel confident in the durability of the business; and number two, we feel confident in what we're going to be able to do [ happier ] relative to pricing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: I wanted to ask, aggregates gross margins on a like-for-like basis, you were essentially flat sequentially versus normal seasonality that where you'd be normally down 12 points. And I'm just wondering, as we consider building off of this margin run rate into 2Q, applying normal seasonality would suggest moderate gross margins in the low to mid-40s, that's excluding delivery revenues in the second quarter. So I just want to make sure we don't get up over our skis and run rating the performance here. Anything we should keep in mind relative to that normal seasonality that just mathematically suggest excluding delivery revenues you'd be in aggregates gross margins in the low to mid-40s in 2Q?\nWard Nye: Jerry, thank you for the questions. So yes, let's be careful with the skis. So the short answer is we're going to see a very nice continued build in margins this year. But the normal build that you would see going from 1 to 2, that would be much larger than it is in most quarters. You won't see that same quantum leap this year. In large measure because as you pointed out, Q1 was so attractive. So do we intend to see and expect to see margin expansion going into Q2 and for the balance of the year. The answer is we do. But I would seriously urge you, don't go leaning into that same degree of percentages that you would have seen in years past. And keep in mind, Jerry, in many respects, we're seeing an EBITDA in Q1 that would have looked like our EBITDA for a full year in 2010. So again, we've built the business very intentionally to be more durable through cycles and through quarters. But given this outstanding performance in Q1, I expect really attractive performance this year. But yes, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves on those percentages. Jim, anything you want to add to that in particular?\nJim Nickolas: Yes. No. Just Jerry, as you think about sort of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, our 3- or 5-year average would show a bigger bump in the line spike in Q2 and Q3. I think for 2023, you should view a higher Q1 and a lower Q2 and Q3 vis-a-vis percent of total profits for the year. So 100% of the profits over the 4 quarters, more in Q1 this year than is typical. But take a little bit out of Q2 and Q3 as a percent of total.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Anthony. If I think about some of the possible drivers of what seems like better than expected realization on your January hike, I think of it maybe like some combination of stronger backlog of demand, maybe some higher anticipated inflation in the industry or maybe some customer rationalization. So in terms of the pricing we saw in 1Q, what would you point to as maybe a bigger driver or maybe a combination of drivers? And then highlight any differences there may be between aggregates and cement?\nWard Nye: Thank you for the question. I think there are a number of different drivers. I think, number one, clearly, inflation just moved very rapidly last year. And what we've proven in this business through cycle after cycle is this is a very durable business. If inflation spikes, very, very quickly, we cannot keep up with the mediacy, but we will catch up with it. We will tend to pass it. And I think that's what you saw. So I think you saw a cumulative action of several different builds from price increases last year, number one; number two, we were very purposeful in moving a number of price increases from April 1 to January 1. That was impactful as well. Keep in mind, the one thing that we've called out that I do think is really important is we have not built midyears into what we're looking at right now, although we do believe midyears are coming. So I think those are the primary drivers. I think, secondarily, is really where we've moved our business over time. So if we're looking at a very strong business in portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, a very strong business in Texas and an emerging business in California, I think all of those help us as we think about the commercial aspects of what we're doing and the fact that aggregates into relatively small percentage of the overall cost of construction. And I think those factors coalesce together to put us in a position that we can expand margins in a business where you have a depleting natural resource. And what we recognize is the stone in the ground is worth more tomorrow than it is today and mindful of how difficult that can be to replace. We want to make sure we're getting fair value for those products today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: Ward, you talked about how pricing lagged inflation last year in the beginning. Now your pricing is well ahead of inflation. Just -- how do we think about that spread of price versus cost inflation into 2024? Can that spread be outsized in '24 as you edge the year with double-digit price increases, the mid-year price increases come through and we start to see cost inflation start to roll over such as oil and diesel?\nWard Nye: Michael, thank you for the question. Number one, if we're looking at overall cost inflation today, it's probably running, let's call it, 7%. So that's not a bad way to think of it. If we're looking at some of the big movers last year, obviously, energy was a really big mover last year, not as much on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So if we're looking at energy up, let's call it, high single digits -- supplies and repairs are the ones that were actually up in -- supplies low teens, repairs low 20s on a percentage basis. At the same time, if we look at what we're doing relative to pricing, we think at this point, we are likely to stay ahead of that. We think we are likely to see margin expansion. And it's certainly our aim to see that throughout '23 and into '24. Again, back to the notion that we're relatively small cost of the overall construction, and we have a product that, by its very nature, is depleting. And despite the fact that because of good planning, we have very long-lived reserves in our operations today. And I think that's important to call out. But nonetheless, I don't think prudent planning on our part should serve as something that would be a detriment on us utilizing our positions to make sure we're getting expanded margins through the cycle for the rest of this year and into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: I have 2 high-level questions, if I could sneak them in. One is just given the nice beat in the first quarter EBITDA and the repeated confidence in mid-quarter midyear price hikes, why just steer to the high end of guidance? Is there something that's keeping you from changing the range? And then similarly on -- when you think about cash use, really nice share buybacks. Does that have any commentary on the M&A opportunities that you're seeing or is it just a combination of ways to use cash?\nWard Nye: Thank you for that. Relative to guidance, we just feel like January, February and March is really early to change guidance. Obviously, you can tell from my tone, you can tell from our prepared remarks that we have a lot of confidence in the year. Obviously, as we've said, it doesn't take into account mid-years. So our view is let's come back at half year, let's revisit guidance. Then we can do it, I think, with much more precision then. So our view is we'll just come back and do it then. Relative to the buybacks, I guess several things. Number one, we obviously had some degrees of dilution just through compensation. We like to address that on an annual basis. Clearly, we've gone in more deeply than that. In many respects, Timna, frankly, because we thought buying Martin Marietta made a lot of sense to us, given where the share price was. So from the perspective of just general uses of cash, that made sense to us. It is not a reflection, let me be clear, on how we're looking at the M&A marketplace right now because what I can assure you is actually the dialogue that we have ongoing and the pipeline actually looks as good as I've ever seen it look. And I think there's some potential transactions that we can discuss later in the year that will largely be pure aggregates in nature, that will be attractive and that will be important. So one of the nice circumstances that we have is this business is cash generative of that we can look at multiple ways to return cash to shareholders and increase value. Share buybacks being one of them, a solid dividend that continues to go up is another way to do it and then [ NCDOT ] accretive acquisitions is a third. So that's how I would answer your questions very directly, Timna.\nOperator: The next question comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid MacGregor: This is really turning. I guess just if I could just build up to Timna's questions for a second, and then I had a principal question. But what is your capital allocation is the longer term because clearly, we're heading into a period, this isn't just 2023. You're heading into a multiyear period of expanding free cash flow. And so the question from a capital allocation standpoint is, is the principal use of that cash at this point to grow by acquisition? Or is there an opportunity to go in, extend your reserve life and expand organically? And just more of a longer-term view on how you put all of these returns to work. And then if I just give you my question now, I really want to just parse out the ASP growth. Obviously, an awfully strong performance, but how much of this is related to just volume growth in the East versus volume declines in the West this quarter? And as you talked about the timing of implementing pricing in January 1 this year versus April 1 last year, it would be great just if you could bridge those points to the reported number. It would be a big help.\nWard Nye: Happy to do what I can, David. Thank you very much. Let's talk first about capital allocation. As we think about capital allocation, to your point, we've not changed our priorities. So our best use of capital is doing the right transaction in the right place. One of the things that we find so remarkable about this business, as we've gone out look in geographies where we would have an interest and looked in areas in which we believe we could also buy businesses, here's what I'll tell you, we found there were what we think are 200 million tons a year of businesses on a per annum basis that we could acquire. So think of it in these terms, David, that's another Martin Marietta that's out there. So if we're looking at modestly over 210 million tons of production or sales last year, there are businesses out there that are modestly bigger than that, that we think would be attractive to us in the geographies that we said we want to grow, number one; number two, if we think about the quarter that you just saw, and again, you're looking at something the same way that I do. And that is, we think we're entering a series of years here that will be very attractive, here's the way I would encourage you to think about the volume. I'm just going to talk a little bit about what was weather affected in the first quarter. And as we look at weather effects in the first quarter, what I would tell you is, overall, if we're looking in the East, where actually the weather was relatively normal and dry, volumes there were up about 570,000 tons. If we look in the Southwest, again, our largest market by revenue, profitability and otherwise, actually, they had almost 2x the rain that we saw in the prior year quarter. Similarly, if we look at Central -- and keep in mind, Central is never going to be a big contributor in Q1 with the possible exception of agg line because people tend to put that on their fields in the winter, they can do if it's cold, they can't do if it's wet, and Central had the wettest Q1 since 2010. And then the West had record rains. So East was up about 570,000. California was down almost 1 million tons, as I said in my prepared remarks. And the Southwest was down about 320,000. So was there -- were there degrees of movement there? Absolutely. Did it really swing the quarter dramatically? Not so much. But I think that does give you a sense of what was happening underlying weather and otherwise in the quarter. So I hope that helps you build that bridge.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rohit Seth with Seaport Research.\nRohit Seth: Volumes seem to be holding up better than expected. Can you discuss your expectations for volumes by market? And maybe comment on what you're seeing today with shipments to the highway projects and what you're seeing with the ramp-up?\nWard Nye: I won't go so much into what we're seeing right now on volume in specific markets because we'll talk more about that in the quarter to come, but here's what I would say. If I go through and really think about our leading states -- and I'll do it this way. If I talk about infrastructure first, TxDOT learnings are expected to exceed $11.2 billion this year. I mean that's an enormous amount. And if we're looking even into next year, it's $11.7 billion. If we're looking in Colorado, which is an important state for us, the recently passed $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill we think is going to have great tailwinds to it. Here in North Carolina, part of what we've seeing here, one, North Carolina has shifted sales tax revenue to the highway fund. So that's going to be an additional 2% this year, 4% in '24, 6% in '25. And in large measure, we're seeing infrastructure increases by $7 billion in North Carolina over the next decade. Obviously, North Carolina is hugely important to us. In Georgia, despite the fact that they had suspended the gas tax proportions of last year, we're seeing $1.1 billion of surplus funds coming back into that. In Florida, record DOT spending, they've got a budget of $13 billion. Again, that's an all-time record. And in California, Governor Newsom has proposed an FY '24 [indiscernible] trends budget of $20.7 billion. That's a 5.6% year-over-year increase. So that's on the federal side. Frankly, not taking into account what can come from Cornyn-Padilla and other things. If we're looking at nonres, and that's something that I think is just so important right now because as we look at those different markets in which we participate right now, Samsung and Texas, the Texas Instruments facility. Golden Pass, CPChem are all big projects. Equally, if we go to Colorado, High Point Logistics park near Aurora is something that's important. But in North Carolina, what we're seeing is Wolfspeed, Microsoft, Toyota, just a host of large industrial projects as well as port development in Georgia. We're seeing Rivian coming into social circle. We're seeing the Hyundai plant in Savannah. So I think to your point, Rohit, if we're looking across volume, and saying, public, we believe, is growing into the second half. We think the second half is where that's really going to show off. We think nonres, as you heard in my commentary, 38% of our shipments, the heavy side of that is good. It looks like it's going to stay good. What we're seeing on those petrochem projects in South Texas and Louisiana is extraordinary right now. And here's the other piece of it that I think is interesting. I think for us, housing is probably at its [indiscernible] right now. As we're thinking about housing, housing started slowing down last year. We're probably seeing the effects of that now. We were still 25% of our volume. And we think in the second half of this year, multifamily is going to start to be joined by single family with more activity. So again, as we think about the way the volume build is likely to go over the next few quarters, we think that's likely to be how it is. I still think this tends to be more of a second half year story than a first half year story. But Rohit, I hope that gives you the color that you were looking at largely on a state-by-state basis.\nRohit Seth: I mean it sounds like the pipeline is pretty strong. Just on the heavy side, is there any risk from the tightened credit conditions on heavy projects being delayed?\nWard Nye: It's hard to imagine on the heavy side, that's going to be an issue. It's interesting to me. Keep in mind, about 55% of our nonres is heavy, about 45% of its light. If we're looking at what we're seeing on heavy, we're seeing energy sector volumes up pretty notably. LNG is up over 300%. Renewables were up 82%. Wind energy -- we saw 300 permits pulled in Iowa for 2024. So again, if we're looking at these types of projects that I don't think tend to be uniquely finance-driven, I think we're in a pretty good place on that. I did call it out relative to certain portions of light that we think might slow down in the second half of the year. And frankly, it's been a little bit better so far than we would have thought that probably helps bridge to a degree what you're seeing relative to the overall goodness in the volumes in Q1.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adrian Huerta with JPMorgan.\nAdrian Huerta: Given what we're seeing on cost inflation for aggregate volume around mid to high single digits and given what we have seen on pricing and even not including a second price increase, would you agree that gross profit per ton seems to be heading to north of $7 for this year?\nWard Nye: Yes. I'll certainly tell you gross profit per ton has a very nice track record to it. And I know if you go to the supplemental slides and you take a look at Slide 5, it gives you a good sense of what that CAGR looks like over a 3-year, 5-year and a 10-year period. And frankly, my sense is that's going to look better in the future than it's looked in the past. So look, you're seeing where it's come from FY 2013 when it was just modestly over $2 a ton to what we're looking at relative to expectations this year, north of $6. I think our ability to grow that metric is frankly, better than others. I think that's what you're likely to see from us. That's something that we're highly focused on. And look, I see where you're going with it. I'm not necessarily in a position to debate it with you. I think it's just a matter of what the time frame is going to look like, Adrian.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley.\nDillon Cumming: I'm sorry to fixate on pricing again. But I think, Ward, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that some of your confidence in the midyear price increase was tied to the fact that oil had inflated pretty significantly post OPEC cut. And again, unfair probably is given the volatility. But if you look at spot crude pricing, today, it's closer back to that point where it was in March. I think about freight rates, I think you're also down significantly year-over-year. When you take those 2 kind of cost items, are you still, I guess, confident in your ability to get those midyear price increases given the kind of contemplated cost deflation there? Or do you feel like it's not as much tied to what you've seen more recently?\nWard Nye: Yes. I am confident we're going to see the midyear price increases. Now let me be clear. I'm not saying we're going to get them in every market and at every place. But I think we're going to see them more widely than we thought back in February, I think they're going to be bigger than we thought in February. And I think you're right. I mean there's some components of energy that aren't moving with the same aggressiveness that we saw last year. At the same time, as I indicated before, if we're looking at our supplies up nearly 13%, if we're looking at repairs in some places up 21.5% ish, those are the types of inflation numbers that we're having to make sure that we can navigate in our business. And for us to do that, we're going to have to make sure we're getting some help on the top line as well. And again, I think Dillon, it's so important to remember, as we said before, we're a very low percentage of the overall cost of construction. We're 10% of the cost of building a road, 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those 2 percentages on our nonres project. So as a practical matter, we think this is going to be very durable. And again, despite the fact that if we look at today's attraction rate, on average, we probably have 70 years of reserves in Martin Marietta operations. Again, good planning should not put us in a point that we're going to be -- that will be punitive to ourselves on what we'll do commercially. So again, we've got great resilience around that. We'll talk more about that and the specifics at our call after Q2.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.\nPhil Ng: Congrats on a very strong quarter. Ward, it was really helpful kind of highlighting all the great funding you have on the infrastructure side, particularly in your states. So the fundings there, there's no denying that. I guess what I wanted to get better color on is timing of projects? In the past, there could be some movement, right, in supply chain, labor stuff. How is that lining up so far in terms of your expectations and how that's progressing? And then separately, on the heavy side, you sound very bullish on that front. In the past, I would have thought it was more 50-50. I appreciate it's a little more aggregates intensive versus the light stuff. How do you see that kind of -- that mix shaping up in the coming years with all the funding you have, whether it's the CHIPS Act or the IRA Act?\nWard Nye: Sure. Thank you so much for that, Phil. So I'd say several things. Historically, what you've had about a 50-50 split between light and heavy on nonres, Historically, that is where we would have resided. You're exactly right. The last couple of years has trended more toward that 55, 45 break, and that's what we continue to see. I think it's likely to stay that way for a while in large measure. Because, frankly, Phil, the heavy projects are getting heavier. And what I mean by that is they're so aggregates-intensive. And now given the degree of manufacturing that's going to be coming with the CHIPS Act and with the IRA and otherwise, I think we're just going to see more of that, and I think that's going to drive heavy. And heavy, literally is just that, it's heavy. To your question on infrastructure, I get it. Look, I still think it's a half 2 issue. I'm still taken by the fact that when I look at our top 10 states, and I look at an overall average of their budgets up year-over-year, 11%. But then when I look at Florida up 38%, north Carolina up 11%, South Carolina up 28%, these are states that for us from an infrastructure perspective really can move the needle. And keep in mind, even the state like Iowa, is up 10%, and Iowa's state where we've got a very attractive position. So a number of these states have not had the historic spend and invest that we're going to see going forward. I do think, again, it's a second half loaded issue. I don't think logistics are the issue going into this year than they have been in years past. Rail is functioning much better. Trucking is functioning much better. Contractors have hired more over the last 18 months than they were able to previously. So we think from a labor perspective, we're in a good space. We think from a DOT and best perspective, we're in a good place. And we think, again, from a logistics perspective, we're really very advantaged today. And again, I think our ability, for example, to get into some of the petrochemical projects in South Texas, utilizing BN, UP and as well as Kansas City Southern and Ship places us in a position that's really unparalleled today in an area that is likely to see just immense work. And again, even on the public side, keep in mind, if we're looking at highway contract awards over the last 3 years, those were growing at a CAGR of around 5.2%. If we look at where they are on an LTM at the end of March, it's up 16.2%. So again, almost 3x what we've seen historically. So I think by any measure, if we look at infrastructure and we look at heavy nonres and then back to that break that you identified between them, I really am pretty enthusiastic about the way that looks from Martin Marietta right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.\nMichael Dudas: Ward, just any thoughts on the performance of Magnesia Specialties? Any indications on maybe general economy you're seeing in that business? Any potential for upside this year and how the business looks moving forward given some of the -- we think some of the positive demand trends that we're seeing tangentially for the rest of your construction world.\nWard Nye: Thank you for the question on agg. So several things: one, it's a very good business; two, I think it's an important differentiator for us; three, record quarterly revenues, again, the RAMP revenues were up 8.4%. The biggest single issues we had there, we saw higher contract services. We had a little bit more kiln downtime. And frankly, steel was running a little bit lower. It's now running at about let's call it, 74% year-to-date, it's been at about 70.1%. So based on some recent history, that's a little bit lower. The other thing that's different in that business, and we're in the process of remedying that. They have longer-term contracts with customers than we would typically see in aggregate that's taken a little bit more time to move those up as we have with aggregates pricing. So the short answer is, it's always ironic when we look at [ MAG ], and we feel like they didn't have the quarter that you would like to have seen. We're still looking at margins with the 3 in front of it. And my guess is as we go through time, we will see that business start moving margins back up to something that looks a lot closer to a 4 instead. So Michael, I hope that's responsive.\nOperator: The last question comes from Garik Shmois with Loop Capital.\nGarik Shmois: Congrats, of course, on the quarter. I wanted to ask on non-res one more time. Just on the light non-res side, it sounds like it's holding in better than expected thus far. I'm curious if you're seeing any change though in the bidding environment? I know you've indicated that you might expect a slowdown later this year, but have there been any recent signs whether in bidding or backlog, the -- that's going to be the case.\nWard Nye: Number one, thank you for the question, Garik. Not so much really. It's really more anticipating where we think that's going to go. Maybe a very modest slowing. But again, -- those projects tend to move relatively quickly. The heavy non-res, you can see coming a long way away. You know that's coming. The light non-res, not as much. So if I told you we had good data on it. I'd be leaning in a little bit more than I should. But I think conversationally, what we're seeing in the world of banking and otherwise, it's just making us look at that with a little bit higher degree of caution. But again, overall, if we think about non-res and what's happening on the heavy side of it, it really does serve as a very powerful counterbalance.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.\nWard Nye: Again, thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's track record of success through various business cycles, proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates led business model. We continue to strive for the safest operations and remain focused on executing our strategic plan while continuing to drive sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2023 results with you in the summer. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Again, thank you for your time and continued support of Mart Marietta. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jenny. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. I'm pleased to report that this year is off to a very strong start for Martin Marietta with first quarter records by nearly every measure. Given our focus on operating safely and responsibly, we're especially pleased that total and lost time incident rates were down 21% and 50%, respectively, in the first quarter. The exceptional quarterly performance is a testament to our team's focus on commercial and operational excellence and the resiliency of our differentiated business model that separates us from others in our industry. We continue to adhere to a value-over-volume approach, focusing on an aggregates-led product strategy and carefully expanding and honing our service footprint, which today is national in scope. In brief, the results we've reported over the recent past, including the first quarter results announced today, are a tribute to our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan and gives us confidence that we will deliver 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, consistent with the high end of our previously announced guidance range. As is common practice, we will revisit our guidance more formally at [indiscernible] year. As for the first quarter, our product demand remained robust. We experienced a modest decline in aggregate shipments as historically wet weather in California was partially offset by a mild winter in the Southeast. However, aggregates pricing momentum continued to build with a 12.8% sequential increase driven by the carryover effects of our 2022 inflation management actions and by broad acceptance of our January 1, 2023 increases, which were pulled forward from April 1 in the vast majority of our markets. These combined shipments and pricing results demonstrate the relative price and elasticity of aggregate demand where customer service and availability of quality in materials tend to be of greater importance than product cost. Our intentional approach to capacity expansion investments at key facilities across our footprint has positioned us well to better serve our customers during this period of high product demand across many of our locations, including markets in the Southeast and Texas. Now let's turn to our financial results. We established a number of first quarter records for Martin Marietta, including consolidated total revenues of $1.35 billion, a 10% increase; consolidated gross profit of $303 million, a 94% increase; diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.16, a 454% increase; adjusted EBITDA of $324 million, a 64% increase; and $5.70 aggregates gross profit per ton, a 134% increase. These results demonstrate the advantages of our value over volume commercial strategy, which was paramount to offsetting continued albeit moderating inflationary pressures. That said, the April OPEC+ production cuts were broadly unexpected and are likely to put upward pressure on fuel expenses throughout the remainder of the year, which tends to flow through to other cost categories. As such, our teams are actively advising customers of midyear price increases, which we anticipate will be more widely accepted and larger in scope and magnitude than we were initially considering a few months ago. Longer term, Martin Marietta is well positioned to benefit from what is expected to be an increasingly favorable and extended pricing cycle. Let's now turn to our first quarter operating performance beginning with aggregates. We experienced solid aggregates demand across our geographic footprint with total aggregate shipments decreasing only 300,000 tons despite an approx but 1 million-ton shipment decline in weather-impacted California. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with pricing increasing 22.6% or 19.6% on a mix adjusted basis. The Texas cement market continues to experience robust demand and tight supply amid near sold-out conditions particularly in the Dallas/Fort Worth [indiscernible]. Yet largely due to wet and cold weather to start the year, first quarter shipments declined 6.8%. Importantly, we delivered pricing growth of 32.2% more than offsetting the effect of lower weather-impacted shipments. We fully expect that favorable Texas cement commercial dynamics will continue for the foreseeable future and accordingly, have announced a $10 per ton price increase effective July 1. Shifting to our targeted downstream businesses. Ready mixed concrete shipments decreased 37.1% and pricing increased 20.2%. As a reminder, our first quarter 2023 ready mixed concrete results exclude the Colorado and Central Texas operations that were divested nearly 13 months ago on April 1, 2022, impacting the comparability to the prior year quarter. Asphalt shipments decreased 25.1%, driven primarily by wet weather in California and Arizona. Pricing improved 9.9% following the increase in raw material costs, principally liquid asphalt or bitumen. Before discussing our outlook for the remainder of 2023, I'll turn the call over to Jim to conclude our first quarter discussion with a review of the company's financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. We like Martin Marietta's prospects in 2023 and beyond as we begin this year with great promise. We continue to experience healthy customer backlogs and are encouraged by a number of factors that support near, medium and long-term demand for our products across the infrastructure and heavy nonresidential construction sectors. As indicated in our supplemental materials, historic legislation including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act are expected to provide funding certainty for large infrastructure, manufacturing and energy projects through the current period of macroeconomic uncertainty. As such, we expect the related product demand for these key end-use segments to be largely insulated. We'll start with infrastructure, which accounted for 32% of first quarter aggregate shipments. The value of state and local government highway bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand, is meaningfully higher year-over-year with growth of 16% to a record $104 billion for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2023. Importantly, state Departments of Transportation, or DOTs in key Martin Marietta states are well positioned from a readiness and resource perspective to utilize the full allocation of federal dollars received from the IIJA in fiscal year 2023. Also late last year, the President signed the fiscal year 2023 spending package, which included the Cornyn - Padilla Amendment, allowing states and local municipalities to allocate unused COVID-19 relief dollars for infrastructure projects. This amendment alone is estimated to provide an additional $40 billion of available infrastructure funding to Martin Marietta's top 10 states. We expect this step change in public sector investment stemming from a number of historic legislative actions to drive sustained multiyear demand for our products in this important, often countercyclical end market. Moving now to nonresidential construction, this quarter's largest end-use representing 38% of our aggregate shipments. Heavy industrial projects led by energy, onshore manufacturing and data centers continue to drive demand in the segment accounting for the majority of total nonresidential shipments. The large project pipeline remains robust. As an example, estimated aggregates requirements for key Gulf Coast petrochemical projects have increased by over 33% since our last earnings report. The aggregates intensity of these Gulf Coast projects is immense. And importantly, we have the production capacity and the long-haul logistics capabilities to supply specification products to these significant projects in a timely manner. In addition to large petrochemical facilities, electric vehicle and related battery plants, semiconductor and other critical product domestic manufacturing projects will be supported by enhanced federal investment from the Inflation Reduction Act and Ships Act, resulting in an extended cycle with the aggregate-intensive, heavy nonresidential sector. With respect to the light nonresidential end market, we've yet to experience any notable weakness in this segment as shipments due in-process projects continue. With that said, new projects may have more difficulty accessing capital if commercial lending conditions meaningfully tighten. As such, we expect a slowdown in product shipments to the light nonresidential sector later this year. Residential shipments accounted for 25% of total aggregate shipments this quarter, reflecting a modest 2.6% decline from the prior year as resilient multifamily construction, partially offset the single-family affordability air pocket. Importantly, recent public homebuilder sentiment has been notably upbeat with respect to single-family housing, and we have observed recent positive data indicative of a near-term bottoming in certain of our [indiscernible] markets. Longer term, the structural housing deficit resulting from a decade of underbuilding is expected to drive a base level of demand for single-family homes across key Martin Marietta geographies for the foreseeable future. To conclude, our record-setting first quarter performance provides excellent momentum going into the balance of the year. As a result, we're confident in our ability to achieve the high end of our previously announced 2023 financial guidance range and navigate the current macroeconomic backdrop. Taking a broader view, we believe that our financial results validate the secular durability of our proven aggregates-led business model as we continue along our path of building and maintaining the safest, most resilient and best-performing aggregates-led public company. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Adam, one thing I'll add to that too to keep in mind, what we've said on pricing so far this year does not take into account the midyears that we think we're going to have in place this year. You heard me speak to them in the prepared remarks, we think we see more mid-years. And we think we see higher midyears coming in this year than we thought we saw even in February. And so I think there are a couple of different components as we think about the margins going forward. Kathryn, thanks for your question. To your question, as we think about pricing and we think about markets, I think several things. One, Kathryn, what you said I agree with. I sum up much of what you said in these words, so I think we're looking at what can be a manufacturing renaissance in the United States. The fact is we as a nation has to get back to building things. And what we're going to see is a nice combination of public spending relative to infrastructure or I should say, investment. We're going to see a lot more manufacturing in the United States, whether it's CHIPS or otherwise. And we're already seeing a nice burgeoning growth in energy. So let's take those 3 things and then step back away from it and think about the where. And I think that's where Martin Marietta is going to be uniquely positioned to win, as you said, going through this because as we think about the position that we've built in the Eastern United States along the I-5, I-95, I-40 corridor, where we are in the central U.S. along the I-35 corridor in Texas, which remember that corridor in Texas all by itself has more people than the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. If you look at the slowest -- I mean, excuse me, the smallest mega region, but fastest growing up and down the I-25 corridor in Colorado, again, we have a very attractive position up and down I-25 where a lot of people are coming in. And now we have to position up and down the I-4 corridor in California as well. So I do think the commercial aspect of what we're doing now and the commercial aspect of what we're doing going forward will be very attractive. But I think the way that we have very intentionally built out this business in mega regions in the United States trading out of areas that were slower growth into areas that are faster growth and will be that way for the long term is going to make the difference. Similarly, keep in mind, we positioned ourselves in states that are in very good shape from a DOT perspective, and we think that matters a lot. So if we're looking at public spend, which we think it's likely to be the single biggest driver of our business over the next several years, keep in mind, 1/3 of the $110 billion in the IIJA that are going to roads and bridges, a full 1/3 of that is going to our top 10 states. So we talk about housing a lot of times just generally, and it's all about location. I would tell you this business, too, is about location. And that location will drive volumes and that location will also drive the pricing. So Kathryn, I hope that gives you a good snapshot of how we look at it. Yes, Trey, it is. So again, we've communicated with our customers in April that we're looking for a $10 a ton increase at half year. And again, that is not yet included in our guidance, which we're saying we're going to revisit more formally at half year. Happy to respond to that. Thank you, Trey. Yes, it was interesting when the termination of that transaction with CalPortland was announced, we actually had a good bit of incoming, and that was not a surprise to us. So we've heard from a number of parties expressing interest in that asset as you saw from our release today. We've also transacted and sold the import cement business in California at Stockton. So again, consistent with our view of what is strategic cement, strategic cement for us is that wonderful cement business that you've heard about in Texas. We will continue to move forward with the process relative to Tehachapi. We feel confident that we will get very attractive value for that. And we feel confident we will transact on that this year. So that's the way we're looking at that right now, Trey. Stanley, thank you so much for the question. So if we really think about what we're looking at from a volume perspective in that state, it's probably going to be around 4.2 million tons this year. Keep in mind, the need for cement in Texas is far greater than the ability to produce it domestically is in Texas today. So number one, you start with that market fundamental, and that's a very attractive place to be. As you know, the largest portion of our cement business is in North Texas. It's led by our Midlothian plant. So as we indicated for the quarter, volumes were down 6.8% overall, largely due to weather. But if we're looking at North Texas, they were down about 1.6%. So again, biggest single piece of our business in Texas remains very robust. Relative to the pricing conversations that we're having with customers, they're aware of where we're going. They're aware of the cost inputs that we continue to see in portions of our business, particularly relative to supplies, materials, those types of things. So as we're sitting here today, again, we've recognized the vast majority of the price increase that we put in place relative to January 1. We're anticipating success on the one that we're looking at on July 1 as well. And we think the overall position of the Texas market -- and keeping in mind a lot of the infrastructure in that state is concrete, most of the roads in Texas are concrete roads and about half of our cement finds its way to infrastructure. So I think when you take the way that state is literally built and where our positions are in Central and North Texas: number one, we feel confident in the durability of the business; and number two, we feel confident in what we're going to be able to do [ happier ] relative to pricing. Jerry, thank you for the questions. So yes, let's be careful with the skis. So the short answer is we're going to see a very nice continued build in margins this year. But the normal build that you would see going from 1 to 2, that would be much larger than it is in most quarters. You won't see that same quantum leap this year. In large measure because as you pointed out, Q1 was so attractive. So do we intend to see and expect to see margin expansion going into Q2 and for the balance of the year. The answer is we do. But I would seriously urge you, don't go leaning into that same degree of percentages that you would have seen in years past. And keep in mind, Jerry, in many respects, we're seeing an EBITDA in Q1 that would have looked like our EBITDA for a full year in 2010. So again, we've built the business very intentionally to be more durable through cycles and through quarters. But given this outstanding performance in Q1, I expect really attractive performance this year. But yes, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves on those percentages. Jim, anything you want to add to that in particular? Thank you for the question. I think there are a number of different drivers. I think, number one, clearly, inflation just moved very rapidly last year. And what we've proven in this business through cycle after cycle is this is a very durable business. If inflation spikes, very, very quickly, we cannot keep up with the mediacy, but we will catch up with it. We will tend to pass it. And I think that's what you saw. So I think you saw a cumulative action of several different builds from price increases last year, number one; number two, we were very purposeful in moving a number of price increases from April 1 to January 1. That was impactful as well. Keep in mind, the one thing that we've called out that I do think is really important is we have not built midyears into what we're looking at right now, although we do believe midyears are coming. So I think those are the primary drivers. I think, secondarily, is really where we've moved our business over time. So if we're looking at a very strong business in portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, a very strong business in Texas and an emerging business in California, I think all of those help us as we think about the commercial aspects of what we're doing and the fact that aggregates into relatively small percentage of the overall cost of construction. And I think those factors coalesce together to put us in a position that we can expand margins in a business where you have a depleting natural resource. And what we recognize is the stone in the ground is worth more tomorrow than it is today and mindful of how difficult that can be to replace. We want to make sure we're getting fair value for those products today. Michael, thank you for the question. Number one, if we're looking at overall cost inflation today, it's probably running, let's call it, 7%. So that's not a bad way to think of it. If we're looking at some of the big movers last year, obviously, energy was a really big mover last year, not as much on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So if we're looking at energy up, let's call it, high single digits -- supplies and repairs are the ones that were actually up in -- supplies low teens, repairs low 20s on a percentage basis. At the same time, if we look at what we're doing relative to pricing, we think at this point, we are likely to stay ahead of that. We think we are likely to see margin expansion. And it's certainly our aim to see that throughout '23 and into '24. Again, back to the notion that we're relatively small cost of the overall construction, and we have a product that, by its very nature, is depleting. And despite the fact that because of good planning, we have very long-lived reserves in our operations today. And I think that's important to call out. But nonetheless, I don't think prudent planning on our part should serve as something that would be a detriment on us utilizing our positions to make sure we're getting expanded margins through the cycle for the rest of this year and into next year. Thank you for that. Relative to guidance, we just feel like January, February and March is really early to change guidance. Obviously, you can tell from my tone, you can tell from our prepared remarks that we have a lot of confidence in the year. Obviously, as we've said, it doesn't take into account mid-years. So our view is let's come back at half year, let's revisit guidance. Then we can do it, I think, with much more precision then. So our view is we'll just come back and do it then. Relative to the buybacks, I guess several things. Number one, we obviously had some degrees of dilution just through compensation. We like to address that on an annual basis. Clearly, we've gone in more deeply than that. In many respects, Timna, frankly, because we thought buying Martin Marietta made a lot of sense to us, given where the share price was. So from the perspective of just general uses of cash, that made sense to us. It is not a reflection, let me be clear, on how we're looking at the M&A marketplace right now because what I can assure you is actually the dialogue that we have ongoing and the pipeline actually looks as good as I've ever seen it look. And I think there's some potential transactions that we can discuss later in the year that will largely be pure aggregates in nature, that will be attractive and that will be important. So one of the nice circumstances that we have is this business is cash generative of that we can look at multiple ways to return cash to shareholders and increase value. Share buybacks being one of them, a solid dividend that continues to go up is another way to do it and then [ NCDOT ] accretive acquisitions is a third. So that's how I would answer your questions very directly, Timna. Happy to do what I can, David. Thank you very much. Let's talk first about capital allocation. As we think about capital allocation, to your point, we've not changed our priorities. So our best use of capital is doing the right transaction in the right place. One of the things that we find so remarkable about this business, as we've gone out look in geographies where we would have an interest and looked in areas in which we believe we could also buy businesses, here's what I'll tell you, we found there were what we think are 200 million tons a year of businesses on a per annum basis that we could acquire. So think of it in these terms, David, that's another Martin Marietta that's out there. So if we're looking at modestly over 210 million tons of production or sales last year, there are businesses out there that are modestly bigger than that, that we think would be attractive to us in the geographies that we said we want to grow, number one; number two, if we think about the quarter that you just saw, and again, you're looking at something the same way that I do. And that is, we think we're entering a series of years here that will be very attractive, here's the way I would encourage you to think about the volume. I'm just going to talk a little bit about what was weather affected in the first quarter. And as we look at weather effects in the first quarter, what I would tell you is, overall, if we're looking in the East, where actually the weather was relatively normal and dry, volumes there were up about 570,000 tons. If we look in the Southwest, again, our largest market by revenue, profitability and otherwise, actually, they had almost 2x the rain that we saw in the prior year quarter. Similarly, if we look at Central -- and keep in mind, Central is never going to be a big contributor in Q1 with the possible exception of agg line because people tend to put that on their fields in the winter, they can do if it's cold, they can't do if it's wet, and Central had the wettest Q1 since 2010. And then the West had record rains. So East was up about 570,000. California was down almost 1 million tons, as I said in my prepared remarks. And the Southwest was down about 320,000. So was there -- were there degrees of movement there? Absolutely. Did it really swing the quarter dramatically? Not so much. But I think that does give you a sense of what was happening underlying weather and otherwise in the quarter. So I hope that helps you build that bridge. I won't go so much into what we're seeing right now on volume in specific markets because we'll talk more about that in the quarter to come, but here's what I would say. If I go through and really think about our leading states -- and I'll do it this way. If I talk about infrastructure first, TxDOT learnings are expected to exceed $11.2 billion this year. I mean that's an enormous amount. And if we're looking even into next year, it's $11.7 billion. If we're looking in Colorado, which is an important state for us, the recently passed $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill we think is going to have great tailwinds to it. Here in North Carolina, part of what we've seeing here, one, North Carolina has shifted sales tax revenue to the highway fund. So that's going to be an additional 2% this year, 4% in '24, 6% in '25. And in large measure, we're seeing infrastructure increases by $7 billion in North Carolina over the next decade. Obviously, North Carolina is hugely important to us. In Georgia, despite the fact that they had suspended the gas tax proportions of last year, we're seeing $1.1 billion of surplus funds coming back into that. In Florida, record DOT spending, they've got a budget of $13 billion. Again, that's an all-time record. And in California, Governor Newsom has proposed an FY '24 [indiscernible] trends budget of $20.7 billion. That's a 5.6% year-over-year increase. So that's on the federal side. Frankly, not taking into account what can come from Cornyn-Padilla and other things. If we're looking at nonres, and that's something that I think is just so important right now because as we look at those different markets in which we participate right now, Samsung and Texas, the Texas Instruments facility. Golden Pass, CPChem are all big projects. Equally, if we go to Colorado, High Point Logistics park near Aurora is something that's important. But in North Carolina, what we're seeing is Wolfspeed, Microsoft, Toyota, just a host of large industrial projects as well as port development in Georgia. We're seeing Rivian coming into social circle. We're seeing the Hyundai plant in Savannah. So I think to your point, Rohit, if we're looking across volume, and saying, public, we believe, is growing into the second half. We think the second half is where that's really going to show off. We think nonres, as you heard in my commentary, 38% of our shipments, the heavy side of that is good. It looks like it's going to stay good. What we're seeing on those petrochem projects in South Texas and Louisiana is extraordinary right now. And here's the other piece of it that I think is interesting. I think for us, housing is probably at its [indiscernible] right now. As we're thinking about housing, housing started slowing down last year. We're probably seeing the effects of that now. We were still 25% of our volume. And we think in the second half of this year, multifamily is going to start to be joined by single family with more activity. So again, as we think about the way the volume build is likely to go over the next few quarters, we think that's likely to be how it is. I still think this tends to be more of a second half year story than a first half year story. But Rohit, I hope that gives you the color that you were looking at largely on a state-by-state basis. It's hard to imagine on the heavy side, that's going to be an issue. It's interesting to me. Keep in mind, about 55% of our nonres is heavy, about 45% of its light. If we're looking at what we're seeing on heavy, we're seeing energy sector volumes up pretty notably. LNG is up over 300%. Renewables were up 82%. Wind energy -- we saw 300 permits pulled in Iowa for 2024. So again, if we're looking at these types of projects that I don't think tend to be uniquely finance-driven, I think we're in a pretty good place on that. I did call it out relative to certain portions of light that we think might slow down in the second half of the year. And frankly, it's been a little bit better so far than we would have thought that probably helps bridge to a degree what you're seeing relative to the overall goodness in the volumes in Q1. Yes. I'll certainly tell you gross profit per ton has a very nice track record to it. And I know if you go to the supplemental slides and you take a look at Slide 5, it gives you a good sense of what that CAGR looks like over a 3-year, 5-year and a 10-year period. And frankly, my sense is that's going to look better in the future than it's looked in the past. So look, you're seeing where it's come from FY 2013 when it was just modestly over $2 a ton to what we're looking at relative to expectations this year, north of $6. I think our ability to grow that metric is frankly, better than others. I think that's what you're likely to see from us. That's something that we're highly focused on. And look, I see where you're going with it. I'm not necessarily in a position to debate it with you. I think it's just a matter of what the time frame is going to look like, Adrian. Yes. I am confident we're going to see the midyear price increases. Now let me be clear. I'm not saying we're going to get them in every market and at every place. But I think we're going to see them more widely than we thought back in February, I think they're going to be bigger than we thought in February. And I think you're right. I mean there's some components of energy that aren't moving with the same aggressiveness that we saw last year. At the same time, as I indicated before, if we're looking at our supplies up nearly 13%, if we're looking at repairs in some places up 21.5% ish, those are the types of inflation numbers that we're having to make sure that we can navigate in our business. And for us to do that, we're going to have to make sure we're getting some help on the top line as well. And again, I think Dillon, it's so important to remember, as we said before, we're a very low percentage of the overall cost of construction. We're 10% of the cost of building a road, 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those 2 percentages on our nonres project. So as a practical matter, we think this is going to be very durable. And again, despite the fact that if we look at today's attraction rate, on average, we probably have 70 years of reserves in Martin Marietta operations. Again, good planning should not put us in a point that we're going to be -- that will be punitive to ourselves on what we'll do commercially. So again, we've got great resilience around that. We'll talk more about that and the specifics at our call after Q2. Sure. Thank you so much for that, Phil. So I'd say several things. Historically, what you've had about a 50-50 split between light and heavy on nonres, Historically, that is where we would have resided. You're exactly right. The last couple of years has trended more toward that 55, 45 break, and that's what we continue to see. I think it's likely to stay that way for a while in large measure. Because, frankly, Phil, the heavy projects are getting heavier. And what I mean by that is they're so aggregates-intensive. And now given the degree of manufacturing that's going to be coming with the CHIPS Act and with the IRA and otherwise, I think we're just going to see more of that, and I think that's going to drive heavy. And heavy, literally is just that, it's heavy. To your question on infrastructure, I get it. Look, I still think it's a half 2 issue. I'm still taken by the fact that when I look at our top 10 states, and I look at an overall average of their budgets up year-over-year, 11%. But then when I look at Florida up 38%, north Carolina up 11%, South Carolina up 28%, these are states that for us from an infrastructure perspective really can move the needle. And keep in mind, even the state like Iowa, is up 10%, and Iowa's state where we've got a very attractive position. So a number of these states have not had the historic spend and invest that we're going to see going forward. I do think, again, it's a second half loaded issue. I don't think logistics are the issue going into this year than they have been in years past. Rail is functioning much better. Trucking is functioning much better. Contractors have hired more over the last 18 months than they were able to previously. So we think from a labor perspective, we're in a good space. We think from a DOT and best perspective, we're in a good place. And we think, again, from a logistics perspective, we're really very advantaged today. And again, I think our ability, for example, to get into some of the petrochemical projects in South Texas, utilizing BN, UP and as well as Kansas City Southern and Ship places us in a position that's really unparalleled today in an area that is likely to see just immense work. And again, even on the public side, keep in mind, if we're looking at highway contract awards over the last 3 years, those were growing at a CAGR of around 5.2%. If we look at where they are on an LTM at the end of March, it's up 16.2%. So again, almost 3x what we've seen historically. So I think by any measure, if we look at infrastructure and we look at heavy nonres and then back to that break that you identified between them, I really am pretty enthusiastic about the way that looks from Martin Marietta right now. Thank you for the question on agg. So several things: one, it's a very good business; two, I think it's an important differentiator for us; three, record quarterly revenues, again, the RAMP revenues were up 8.4%. The biggest single issues we had there, we saw higher contract services. We had a little bit more kiln downtime. And frankly, steel was running a little bit lower. It's now running at about let's call it, 74% year-to-date, it's been at about 70.1%. So based on some recent history, that's a little bit lower. The other thing that's different in that business, and we're in the process of remedying that. They have longer-term contracts with customers than we would typically see in aggregate that's taken a little bit more time to move those up as we have with aggregates pricing. So the short answer is, it's always ironic when we look at [ MAG ], and we feel like they didn't have the quarter that you would like to have seen. We're still looking at margins with the 3 in front of it. And my guess is as we go through time, we will see that business start moving margins back up to something that looks a lot closer to a 4 instead. So Michael, I hope that's responsive. Number one, thank you for the question, Garik. Not so much really. It's really more anticipating where we think that's going to go. Maybe a very modest slowing. But again, -- those projects tend to move relatively quickly. The heavy non-res, you can see coming a long way away. You know that's coming. The light non-res, not as much. So if I told you we had good data on it. I'd be leaning in a little bit more than I should. But I think conversationally, what we're seeing in the world of banking and otherwise, it's just making us look at that with a little bit higher degree of caution. But again, overall, if we think about non-res and what's happening on the heavy side of it, it really does serve as a very powerful counterbalance. Again, thank you so much for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta's track record of success through various business cycles, proves the resiliency and durability of our aggregates led business model. We continue to strive for the safest operations and remain focused on executing our strategic plan while continuing to drive sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2023 results with you in the summer. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Again, thank you for your time and continued support of Mart Marietta. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning to everyone. The Building Materials business posted first quarter revenues of $1.27 billion, a 10.1% increase over last year's comparable period and a first quarter gross profit record of $276 million, a 99.4% increase. Aggregates gross profit improved 131.7% relative to the prior year, resulting in a first quarter record of $238 million. Aggregate gross margin improved 1,250 basis points to 26.1% as strong pricing growth more than offset modestly lower shipments and continued inflationary pressure impacting most cost categories. Aggregates gross margin also benefited from geographic shipment mix, which reflected a larger contribution from the higher-margin Southeast markets. Geographic mix is expected to normalize over the balance of the year. Our Texas cement business delivered record first quarter top and bottom line results, continuing its recent track record of exceptional performance. Revenues increased 21.9% to $169 million, while gross profit increased 75.4% to $47 million. Importantly, execution of our disciplined commercial strategy drove gross margin expansion of 860 basis points to 28% as pricing gains and normalization of natural gas expenses more than offset lower operating leverage and higher raw materials and maintenance costs. As we shared previously, our Midlothian, Texas plant has several initiatives underway to increase production capacity. The largest of those is the installation of a new finish mill that we expect to complete in the third quarter of 2024. The new finish mill will provide 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in today's nearly sold out marketplace. At both our Midlothian and Hunter Texas plants, the process of converting our construction cement customers from type 1, type 2 cement to a less carbon-intensive Portland-limestone cement, also known as type 1L, is substantially complete. We expect those efforts to provide additional capacity of 5% this year as compared to 2022. Our ready mixed concrete revenue declined 24.4% to $220 million and gross profit declined 48.9% to $11 million driven primarily by the divestiture of our Colorado and Central Texas operations last April, impacting prior year comparability. Our asphalt and paving revenues increased 2.1% to $58 million as increased pricing offset weather-impacted shipments in California and Arizona. Consistent with its typical seasonality, this business posted a $20.5 million gross loss as the Minnesota operations are inactive during the first quarter given that market's late spring start to the construction season. Ideally, most asphalt installations occur when both ground and air temperatures are between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Magnesia Specialties generated record first quarter revenues of $83 million an 8.4% increase. Despite top line growth, gross profit declined 2.7% to $25 million due to higher supplies and contract services expenses, resulting in a 330 basis point decline and gross margin to 30%. We remain focused on the disciplined execution of our strategic plan, which emphasizes responsible growth through acquisitions, reinvestment in our business operations and the consistent return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $117 million to shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly 204,000 shares of common stock at an average price of approximately $368 per share in the first quarter. Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends as well as share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio continued its downward trend and ended the quarter at 2.4x, within our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x. With that, I will turn the call back to Ward. Yes. The main answer to the question is ASP growth. That carried a lot of the weight, and it was just obviously a phenomenal performance this year. So that really is the answer. And of course, that's going to carry through into the subsequent quarters as well. That sticks, as you know. So no real changes or unusual items on the cost side but ASO did the [indiscernible] work. Plus, as you know, we advanced pricing increases from April 1 into January 1 successfully this year, and that had a big impact as well. Yes. No. Just Jerry, as you think about sort of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, our 3- or 5-year average would show a bigger bump in the line spike in Q2 and Q3. I think for 2023, you should view a higher Q1 and a lower Q2 and Q3 vis-a-vis percent of total profits for the year. So 100% of the profits over the 4 quarters, more in Q1 this year than is typical. But take a little bit out of Q2 and Q3 as a percent of total."

        "content": "Operator: Hello. Welcome to Martin Marietta's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are now in a listen-only. A question-and-answer session will follow the company\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin.\nJacklyn Rooker: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available, during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance, our preliminary view for 2025 and supporting market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn, and thank you all for joining this teleconference. During the third quarter, we experienced a series of well-chronicled extreme weather events, including significant July precipitation together with Tropical Storm Debby in North Carolina, Hurricane Beryl in Texas and Hurricane Helene across much of our Southeast footprint. First and foremost, we're grateful that our employees and their families are safe. Our thoughts, prayers and ongoing support remain focused on those who have suffered so disproportionately during these natural disasters. We're particularly mindful of our neighbors in Western North Carolina as they begin the long process of rebuilding. Aside from the human cost of these events, we and a host of other businesses were affected by the storms. In our specific case, project delays and inefficiencies negatively impacted our financial results. And as a consequence, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.07 billion at the midpoint. To help better demonstrate the severity of these weather events during the last two quarters to our upstream product shipments, we provided two case studies on Page 8 of our supplemental information. The first case study is particularly revealing relative to cement. As you will recall, the second quarter's significant precipitation was particularly notable in Dallas-Fort Worth, our company's single largest market area, resulting in an 18% decline in our mid low-teen cement shipments. Encouragingly, as the weather improved, so did Midlothian's third quarter shipments. Shifting now to aggregates. Our implied fourth quarter shipment guide reflects a 5% increase in shipments, a notable improvement relative to the third quarter's 4% decline. Our fourth quarter view is primarily based on October's trends and reasonable expectations for the remainder of the year. These statistics demonstrate the important irony of disruptive and destructive weather. Planned shipments are not generally canceled, they're delayed. And depending on seasonality and severity, resumption of planned shipments usually occurs in the following months and/or quarters. Despite these weather-related events, I'm pleased to highlight some of our team's accomplishments. First, we achieved the best year-to-date safety incident rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Operationally, our teams achieved record quarterly aggregates gross profit per ton of $8.16, record third quarter cash flows from operations and record third quarter revenues and gross profit in our Magnesia Specialties business. Given the totality of the quarter's uncontrollable and exigent circumstances, these are notable records upon which we intend to build. With respect to continuing to build, in October, we acquired pure aggregate assets in South Florida and Southern California, both attractive and growing Martin Marietta markets. Consistent with our strategic operating analysis and review, or SOAR plan, these bolt-on acquisitions further enhance our gross profit contribution from the aggregates product line and improve the long-term durability of our business. Together, these accomplishments reflect our team's focus on matters we can control while underscoring the resiliency of our aggregates-led business, which is strategically positioned in the country's fastest-growing markets. Importantly, these results reinforce our expectation that our aggregates price cost spread will continue to expand over time, driving improvement in unit profitability through macroeconomic cycles. As we look towards 2025, we remain focused on the long-term aspects of our business that we can meaningfully impact, world-class safety, the consistent and disciplined execution of our strategic plan, resolute adherence to our leading commercial strategy and prudent cost management through ongoing operational excellence efforts. Equally, we expect product shipments will recover due to more normal weather patterns and an expected improvement in warehouse and residential construction. Preliminarily, we expect that 2025 overall aggregate shipments will increase by low single-digits and aggregates pricing will increase by mid to high single-digits. Moving now to end market trends. Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming elections, both rebuilding and maintaining our nation's infrastructure remains a bipartisan national strategic priority. Record levels of state and federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, continue to support attractive demand for highways and streets construction. And while growth rates in contract awards have predictably flattened, as reflected in the value of contract awards for the 12-month period ending August 31, 2024, the baseline for highway and street spending is well above historical levels. Looking ahead, funding certainty at the state and federal level will provide volume stability and support a healthy pricing environment in this aggregate intensive, often countercyclical end market for years to come. Relative to heavy nonresidential construction, the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure supports emerging growth trends in both data centers and related energy requirements. Moreover, aggregates-intensive warehouse construction appears to be cyclically bottoming in select markets, as indicated by recent project announcements. For example, Amazon is planning to build one of its largest North American distribution centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with our leading aggregates position, strategic and large capacity cement plant, and affiliated ready mixed presence in this dynamic market, Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to supply materials to this project, which is expected to begin later this year. Shifting now to light nonresidential and residential activity, housing availability and affordability remain key issues impacting single-family demand. While a correction of these issues will not be immediate, we believe that loosening monetary policy is an important first step. It passed its prologue, and we believe that to be the case as residential construction recovers, light nonresidential activity typically follows. In summary, we believe multiyear public construction activity, reshoring, the artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out and the long-awaited single-family housing-led residential recovery all call us to support durable aggregate shipment growth and continued attractive pricing momentum for years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, the Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.8 billion, a 6% decrease, and gross profit of $588 million, a 9% decrease. The decline in both metrics is due to the February divestiture of our South Texas cement and related concrete businesses, along with shipment declines in all product lines, partially offset by acquisition contributions. Aggregates gross profit per ton improved 3% to a quarterly record of $8.16, notwithstanding lower shipment volumes, highlighting the efficacy of our value over volume commercial strategy. Aggregates pricing increased 7.7% or 8.9% on an organic mix-adjusted basis. Cement and concrete revenues decreased 30% to $296 million, and gross profit decreased 37% to $89 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations. I'm pleased to report the construction of our new finished mill at Midlothian is complete, which will provide us with approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in the attractive North Texas market. Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 5% to $343 million, and gross profit decreased 8% to $61 million. Wet weather, project delays and a softer nonresidential market drove the shipment decline, while lower revenues and higher aggregates costs negatively impacted profitability. Magnesia Specialties posted record third quarter revenues and gross profit of $82 million and $29 million, respectively, as benefits from strong pricing and improved lime shipments more than offset lower chemical shipments. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. As Ward mentioned, we achieved record third quarter cash flows from operations of $601 million, an increase of 32% as compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to working capital improvements that more than offset lower net earnings. Consistent with our long-standing capital allocation priorities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed over $2.5 billion on pure-play aggregates assets, invested $622 million of capital back into our business and returned $591 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In our 30 years as a publicly traded company, we have steadily maintained or increased our dividend, and this year is no exception. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase to the quarterly cash dividend paid in September, reaffirming our confidence in the durability and sustainability of our company's future growth and free cash flow generation. We have now returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.0 times for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, preserving financial flexibility to continue actively pursuing value-enhancing high-quality aggregates acquisitions and prudently reinvesting in our business all while returning capital to Martin Marietta shareholders through dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Jim. As our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, Martin Marietta remains focused on matters we can control, an unwavering commitment to safety and the environment, commercial and operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic priorities. We have thoughtfully shaped and expanded our aggregates-led portfolio and deliberately built our business with leading positions in the nation's fastest-growing markets, making Martin Marietta an increasingly resilient, efficient and cash flow generative business that can consistently drive shareholder value creation. With these attractive underlying fundamentals, our best-in-class teams, unparalleled growth opportunities and proven strategic priorities, we're excited about the prospects in 2025 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with TRG. Please go ahead.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Probably my question on weather and then looking forward. So how did weather impact Q3 results, both from a volume and a pricing optic standpoint? And could you give color on how shipments have trended into October and really looking at post-storms? Thank you.\nWard Nye: Kathryn, thanks for the question. It's a good one because that really does highlight much of what happened in the quarter. Several things that I would say. Number one, as we discussed before, Q2 in its own way, was a washout. And Q3 was as well, from a weather perspective, which is why we put that supplemental slide on Page 8 in the deck today because I think it does give good color relative to how significant the weather events were to our shipments. So as you can see, if you look at that slide, Q2 was really severe in DFW, and as Q3 rolled around, it wasn't as bad in DFW, and you saw a really nice snapback in volumes at Midlothian. Now Q3 was just tough across the Southeast and much of the East. Look, here's your takeaway. We literally had a hurricane every 2.5 weeks in Q3. And they were coming through and disproportionately hitting our Eastern business and a lot of it, frankly, our Southeastern business. And to your point, Kathryn, if we're looking at businesses that have our highest ASPs, if we're looking at businesses that have our highest margins, that's the sweet spot. And that's the part that really was hit hard, hard, hard in the quarter. So if we're looking at it overall, did it affect the shipments? I think, notably. Disproportionate drive our shipments down, absolutely. It was a disproportionate driver of what happened to the profitability because of the wear. And then the other piece of it is it made it more difficult in some instances to get the same degree of midyear price increases this year that we saw last year. So you really had almost a trifecta of issues that went through. Now to the second part of your question, it's a good one. I was reading the Wall Street Journal this morning, it was talking about much of the country being in some degree of a drought in October. And the fact is October has been much more normal. And what we've seen in October is really what is driving what you've seen relative to our aggregate forecast going forward because if you look at it, what it's basically saying is we're anticipating aggregates to be up 5% in Q4. And that's really on the back of what we're seeing in October. So several things I would note, as I think about the durability and how real that is. One, we're seeing the tonnage. Two, we're seeing our customers continue to add to their backlogs. So we're seeing nice sequential build in customer backlogs. And the other thing to me that's telling is our customers are hiring right now, too. So when you're seeing good activity that we're seeing in October when we're seeing dry weather, when we're seeing good activity from backlog from a customer perspective, and we're seeing contractors hiring right now, we think all of those together give a nice picture of what's to come. But when you step back from it, too, it answers, I think, the essence of your question. How much did weather matter? Answer, it mattered a lot. How much did it matter relative to volume? A lot. How much does it matter relative to profitability? Frankly, even more than it did relative to volume. So Kathryn, I hope that helps.\nKathryn Thompson: It does. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Kathryn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, Ward and Jim. Hope you are doing well.\nWard Nye: Yes.\nTrey Grooms: So, kind of a follow-on to that. Clearly, the Carolinas, particularly Western North Carolina, which is right in your guys backyard, were unfortunately devastated by Helene. And there's other areas as well that have seen pretty serious issues as a result of the extreme weather. If you could maybe talk about some of the recovery efforts that are going on there and what that could mean for Martin Marietta, given that it is right here in your backyard.\nWard Nye: Yes, Trey, it is in our backyard, and you're right. And Western North Carolina did feel that, the words that I gave in the prepared remarks were disproportionately, so we are trying to make sure that we're doing all we can to help that part of the state rebuild. I mean, here are some data points for you. NCDOT estimates that the Helene recovery expenses will be between $5 billion and $6 billion, just relative to NCDOT. Now to put some other color to that, typically, the federal government reimbursement rate for that is between 60% and 65%, which means as a practical matter, North Carolina\u2019s share of that burden is going to be about $2 billion. Now as we think about how we're positioned to help rebuild that part of the state, several things I'd point to. Number one, we have operations in North Carolina that go nicely west of Hickory. So we're getting into the foothills, getting into the Appalachians with our North Carolina operations. It's important to remember, too, that with the Blue Water transaction, we actually acquired a number of sites in Eastern Tennessee. So that now puts us into a position that we can come into those areas, both from Eastern Tennessee and Western North Carolina to make sure we're providing the work and the support that, that area is going to need. Now importantly, too, NCDOT has said that it's going to be business as usual in terms of construction and maintenance activity outside of the work for Helene. So we're not going to see other parts of the state not continuing to advance. North Carolina can do that and take care of what's happening relative to Helene. And I think this is an important piece of it, too, Trey, because when we talk about SOAR and where we have built our business and why. One of the areas that we've long said is we want to be in states that are in a good fiscal condition because when these type of things happen, we need to be in places that states can manage that. And it was interesting, I was reading a piece in the Pew Trust last week, and it outlined that North Carolina was only one of a handful of states, literally, that use a budget stress test to determine how much should be set aside in its rainy day fund. And the state currently has a surplus of $6 billion in that. And if you're keeping score at home, that's about $4.25 billion more than we saw in the last budget. So will there be rebuilding? Yes. Is it going to be extensive? Yes. Will it take not months or years, but probably the better part of a decade? My guess is that it will and will be there to help, absolutely.\nTrey Grooms: Great. Thank you for all the color on that. I\u2019ll pass it on. Good luck.\nWard Nye: You bet. Thank you, Trey.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nGarik Shmois: Hi, thanks for having me on. I was wondering if you can go over the acquisitions that you made in a little bit more detail in South Florida and California. Any more color on the size of the acquisitions, the volume contribution, how pricing looks in these markets? And maybe help us think about if there's any either a benefit in 4Q or any kind of related headwind as you integrate and what the outlook for '25 will play?\nWard Nye: Garik, thanks for the question. Yeah, I can help you with that a little bit. So number one, both these transactions are totally consistent with SOAR. And what I mean by that is you've seen us historically go into relatively new markets for Marietta like we did in California or Florida in this instance. And we basically do platform transactions and then we come behind them with a series of bolt-ons where we can augment our position. That's exactly what you're seeing in both of these deals. So I would tell you several things. One, both are complementary. They are both pure aggregate bolt-ons. So again, one in the High West in Southern California, one where we bought Blue Water. Equally, and I think this is important, both our percentage margin and unit margin accretive. So these are attractive, pure stone businesses. The combined reserves are over 150 million tons in areas with notable reserve shortages. So again, we continue to augment our reserve position in those markets. Integration is going to be complete very, very quickly. New pricing will be effective on January 1. What's important is doing all of these together and with both these transactions, it's still sub $1 billion on what we've done. Our leverage remains completely within our target range, and the pipeline of aggregates acquisitions remains active. So we think there's more to come on that. Relative to the guide for the rest of this year, we've effectively put nothing in the guide for the rest of this year for these businesses because as you recall, the tyranny of purchase price accounting in this means that we had to take all of the inventory there and mark it up to fair market value. So what you anticipate after a transaction is for those early months, you're not going to see that much from a P&L perspective. But these transactions, frankly, Garik, like so much of this year has been a setup for 2025. This puts us in better positions in markets where we want to have these leading positions. These are attractive pure stone transactions. And again, we believe the commercial trends that we will see at these operations will continue to be very attractive. And part of what I think is worth noting as well. If we go back and take a look at even the Blue Water transactions that we've done, and what we've done relative to getting those businesses back up to something that looks more like Martin Marietta market pricing, when you and I had this conversation at Q2, there was about a $5 a ton delta on ASP between the acquired operations and heritage at that point. Now that's about $3 a ton. So I think if you take the overall philosophy that we have, look at the geographies in which we've made these transactions, what the reserve base looks like and what it can mean in our heritage business and acquired businesses, as you can tell probably from my tone and words, we're pretty excited about these deals.\nGarik Shmois: Yeah, sounds like it. Thanks guys.\nWard Nye: Thanks, Garik.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everone.\nWard Nye: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Hi. Ward, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the pricing revision and guidance. So normally, midyear set you folks up for pricing the following year. So can you just expand on the drivers of the negative revisions to the pricing outlook this year? And then as we think about the outlook for mid to high single-digits in '25, you folks had previously spoken about moving to higher sustainable pricing than what we've seen in the past, which would essentially be the mid-single-digit part of the range. So I don't know if that's a mix of M&A that's driving that or other factors, but can I trouble you to expand in those areas, please.\nWard Nye: No, happy to. So, it\u2019s several things. Answering the back part of your question first. I just think we're going to see good, steady durable pricing going forward. Look, I think that mid- to high probably, with an emphasis on high, is probably the right way to think of it next year because one, we're just going to see more price in our heritage businesses. Number two, we're going to continue to see the acquisitions move up nicely. If we think about what happened just here in the last three months, I think several things very candidly, One, did weather impacted delays from a geographic mix perspective caused some headwinds? You bet. If we're looking also at what some of the geographic mix has been, meaning we're selling more fines or other lower-priced materials, that was the piece of it as well. And when you take the weather-impacted delays and the other issues faced with the year, we did see a lower percentage of midyear price increases this year than we saw last year. That's nothing that causes me any concern as I look at it. I think this year was faced with some very challenging near-term dynamics that helped drive that, which means the carry over next year is smaller than it was this year. So we're only looking at about 80 basis points that are carry over for next year. So I think that gives you a sense as we think about the build, the type of resolve we have around a very good marketplace next year with respect to pricing. And again, what I'm taken by, Jerry, is it's hard to produce what we produce on a spec market basis and put it out there and sell it for what we sell it for. I continue to believe that the value of what we're putting on the ground and the value that we add to overall construction is still something that has some running room ahead of it for all the right reasons. But I hope that answers your question.\nJerry Revich: It does. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Jerry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is open.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi, good morning.\nWard Nye: Good morning.\nAnthony Pettinari: Understanding the impact of the weather on 3Q in '24, as you look to '25, can you just talk about how backlogs have trended? And if there's anything you pull up from either an end market perspective or a geographic perspective? And then just given the outsized weather impact this year, does that give you maybe a little bit more visibility or confidence into volumes for the following year, given we may be seeing kind of a catch-up or a rebound year?\nWard Nye: Thank you for the question, Anthony. I think it certainly does. And if we're looking at current backlogs, I mean, they are up very nicely relative to the prior year quarter and sequentially as well, both in the mid-single-digits range right now. So when you're sitting there at this point of the year with that degree of up with what I think is a lot of upside ahead of us, that's what starts to give us a sense of that next year clearly is going to be a much improved year relative to volume. If we think about end users all by themselves, there's no reason, from my perspective, that we shouldn't expect public to be better, frankly, for the next couple of years at least. If we look at the IIJA funds that are actually in the system today, I mean, what's been obligated is one thing. What's actually been spent and what's been reimbursed is actually considerably lower. And frankly, it's in the 20% range right now. So there's so much more of that to come. And then when we tackle that together with state DOT budgets, that are actually in a very good position. I gave a little bit of color a few minutes ago where North Carolina is just in a host of different perspectives. But again, if we're looking at our top 10 states, 80-plus-percent of those actually see their budgets up for next year. Equally, if we look at resi, we believe, clearly, resi is not going to be something that's going to turn on a dime, but we are seeing that, we believe, beginning to turn with some green shoots in a series of markets. And frankly, we almost have to see it. The population dynamic trends have been so significant in the states in which we have leading positions, that the single-family housing market is in dire need of greater activity. But I think importantly, too, and you heard me mention in the prepared remarks, when we're seeing things like suddenly warehousing showing some degrees of green shoots. Obviously, that has been a sector of heavy non-res that has been looking for bottom for a while. We think it's really finding bottom. And now when we're seeing Amazon put in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, one of its largest facilities in North America, we think that's the moment. But equally, as we start thinking about AI and what that's going to mean and energy and what that's going to mean and the reassuring that we know is coming. These, to me, underscore what I believe will be a nice, steady sequential multiyear build. It should be that. And then relative to the light non-res, keep in mind, that's actually been better over the last couple of quarters on a percentage basis of our volume than heavy non-res has been. And that tells me, as we see a res recovery, we're likely to see a more quickly than usual recovery in light non-res. So I think those things, as we build them together, Anthony, is what gives us a high degree of confidence next year and what we're talking about on volumes. I do think, as a company, I do think as an industry, we're usually pretty good at having a good feel for what's happening commercially. I'm not sure that we're always great on knowing precision, what's going to happen with volumes. So I think if we've done anything, we'd probably err to the side of being relatively cautious with respect to our volume outlook next year, and that still has us up.\nAnthony Pettinari: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful color. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAngel Castillo: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Thanks for all that color, that was very helpful. Just maybe wanted to switch over to the cost side of the kind of price/cost dynamic. And just if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're kind of anticipating there as we head into 2025?\nWard Nye: No, happy to. And I'll ask Jim to take you through what we're seeing from an inflation perspective and otherwise.\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. So the underlying inflation for this quarter was actually coming close to where we expected, about mid-single-digits, call it, 5%. The additional COGS per ton inflation we saw was largely due to our inventory drawdown for the quarter. And that will continue probably a little bit into next quarter. But for 2025 in total, I would -- I'm still sticking with my mid-single-digit cost inflation view overall, which would be obviously well below where Ward clearly enunciated our ASP expectations are mid to high single-digits. So the price/cost spread should continue to trend favorably. And again, inflation, if anything, it seems to be trending down. So more to come on that next year. We'll come up with after Q4 earnings.\nAngel Castillo: Very helpful. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you, Angel.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nPhilip Ng: Hey, guys. Ward, great to hear that aggregates volumes are trending up 5% in the fourth quarter now that weather has cleared out. Does that number include some of the recent acquisitions you've just [indiscernible] P&L impact, it doesn't have much. And when we look at the 2025, I think, the low single-digit volume framework, is that on an organic basis as well? Just trying to get a better handle what you're actually seeing out there?\nWard Nye: No. Look, great questions, Angel. Thank you so much for that. So short answer is no, no. Q4 is not taking into account anything from the new acquisitions. And again, we talked a little bit about the purchase price accounting. I'm sorry, Phil. And so it doesn't have anything in there for Q4. And again, we'll come back and really factor those into the guide when we come back to you in February, Phil, and give you a better feel for what we think 2025 will look like. And that's where you will see the Southern California and South Florida transactions factored into it. I hope that helps.\nPhilip Ng: Okay. So fourth quarter volume, up 5%. And next year up low single digits, largely organic. That's really encouraging to see.\nWard Nye: That's correct. Yes, Phil. You got it.\nPhilip Ng: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You bet. Take care.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nWard Nye: Hey, good morning, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, lots of good color on the call. But Jim, if I look at CapEx, I think it's up to $875 million at the midpoint from $700 million at the midpoint, I think, last quarter. It seems like a pretty big jump. And I'm just curious if there was some opportunistic land purchases? Or was that Midlothian? Any color there? And just any early thoughts on CapEx into '25?\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. So it's largely a function of the two acquisitions that Ward mentioned. One of those is structured in a way that's being treated as CapEx, and that is an operational acquisition. So that bump up in CapEx guide for the year is almost solely attributable to that deal. And next year, we typically guide to 9%, 9.5% of revenues. So probably not a bad way to think about it to start for next year. We'll have more detail next year, though.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That answers my question. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Welcome. Thank you, Tyler.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thanks, good morning. Ward or Jim, just with respect to the Midlothian expansion. I guess when you think about the supply-demand dynamics in that region, would you expect to sell out that incremental capacity next year? Or is there a ramp-up period with that new capacity we need to consider?\nWard Nye: Thanks for the question. The short answer is, this is going to be a ramp-up period for that. Look, that's an important marketplace to us. We want to go about that in a very thoughtful way. Midlothian is performing actually very well right now. I mean it's been interesting that we actually saw improved gross profit per ton at Midlothian. We've seen very constructive pricing in Midlothian, which tells you what a different marketplace in North Texas is from many others. And so we will be very thoughtful. We'll be very careful and we'll be very methodical about how we go about that at Midlothian. So short answer is, don't expect all of that next year, expect that over a period of time, and yes, it will ramp.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you.\nWard Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nDavid MacGregor: Yes, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.\nWard Nye: Hi, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Hi, good morning. I guess I want to start with just a clarification on Garik's question, and then I have a question for you. But on the clarification, you had talked about the delta going from $5 to $3 a ton. I guess that how many tons would you say, just approximately, that $3 a ton would apply to? And then I have another question.\nWard Nye: Yeah. No, I don't know that we've ever come out with precise tonnage on that. But what I would refer you back to, take a look at Blue Water and take a look at Frei because those are really the two different transactions to which that metric applies. So it's really going to mean Denver in one instance. Central and Eastern Tennessee in another, and in primarily portions of Northern Alabama. Obviously, the Blue Water transaction covered more states than that. But from a gravity perspective, that's most of it, David.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. So you're caught up in California now?\nWard Nye: We are largely caught up in California. That's exactly right.\nDavid MacGregor: Right. Okay. And I guess my question was more regarding tariffs and cement. And just mindful that in Midlothian, you're quite removed from the import market influence. Down in Houston, there's probably a $40 to $50 ton price discrepancy between those two markets, which you alluded to a moment ago. How much would DFW benefit from cement tariffs?\nWard Nye: That's a great question. I mean there's just not a lot of import activity that goes into DFW to begin with because the transportation logistics becomes so complicated, getting it there by some form of either river or ocean going vessel then offloading then going through the boards then putting it on trucks and then sending it a long way. So look, I think Dallas Worth, simply because of its location that far from water is different. I think Dallas Fort Worth, because of the overall economy in DFW, I mean when we bought TXI, we bought it in large measure, not exclusively thinking the Dallas-Fort Worth would probably be the best-looking heavy side building materials market in the United States for the next 25 or 30 years. And we've been right on that. And I don't see anything that makes us change our view on it. So is it already a good market? Yes. Do we anticipate it's going to stay a good market? Yes. What I answer your question, look, if tariffs come in, does it make a really good market look even better? The answer is yeah, I think it does.\nDavid MacGregor: Good. Thanks very much.\nWard Nye: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dudas with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nMike Dudas: Good morning, Jacklyn, Jim, Ward.\nWard Nye: Hi, Mike.\nMike Dudas: Again, I appreciate all the observations looking towards your business in 2025. Maybe you can maybe look at it from a geographic basis, as you look at your volume and pricing guidance. Is there areas of your East versus Western business that you feel more comfortable with? Is there any upside surprises in some of the regions that we might typically not think about? Is that also, I assume, may impact the mix and your ability to grow gross profit per ton in 2025?\nWard Nye: Mike, thanks for the question. I would say several things. One, as we discussed earlier in the call, the pricing dynamic that we needed to address in California has largely been addressed. And now we have a more formidable business there with the M&A that we've done. So I would continue to think in particular that Southern California would be a marketplace that should be a relatively bright spot for us. Number two, I would say Texas is going to continue to be a bright spot for us. Clearly, North Texas, as I look at the market, I really think of it, North Texas, Central Texas, South Texas in those three buckets. I think North Texas is going to continue to be the strongest of those markets. I think Central Texas is going to be absolutely fine as well. And again, the TxDOT program there shows growth going into next year. again, Florida will continue to be an important market for us for 2 different reasons. One, we've historically been the largest importer of granite into that market. So we had a disproportionate infrastructure view in that marketplace. Now though that we're getting in-state operations that can really start feeding more concrete and feed more private work, we're going to see continuing attractive work in Florida. If we think about North Carolina, we've gone through that. One, the DOT program is up year-over-year. Number two, we've talked about what would be of necessity, a significant rebuild in the western part of the state and we think that will continue to be attractive. But equally, if we look at Indiana, their budget's up next year. If we look at Georgia, their budget's up almost -- it's over 7% next year. Colorado's budget is up 14%. Arizona's budget is equally up double digits next year. So if I'm thinking about overall end users, I mean, that clearly addresses it relative to the public side. And I've said earlier, that ought to be good for at least a couple of years. Equally, as we think about private in those states, those are all fast-growing states that have seen significant population trends. So my view is the long-term, and medium term and near-term volume picture ought to be increasingly attractive and long term, medium and short term, the commercial side and the pricing piece of it ought to outkick whatever historical coverage is. That's going to continue to perform in ways that I will think will be a differentiator relative to other industrial sectors.\nMike Dudas: Excellent work. Thank you.\nWard Nye: You\u2019re most welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTimna Tanners: Yeah. Hey, good morning. Wanted to dig a little bit more into the end market outlook on Slide 7 of your supplemental information. So specifically, I guess, starting with the non-res private sector piece, the data centers are generally pretty low single-digits of total percent. The other pieces tend to be a lot bigger. Like what are you seeing in data centers? Is there something specific to your geographies where you know of some big, lumpy projects coming through? Yeah, go ahead.\nWard Nye: I'm sorry, Timna. I didn't mean to interrupt. Was there more, Timna? I didn't mean to interrupt you.\nTimna Tanners: Well, I was just hoping for a little more color like on why you might have been more neutral on warehouses and manufacturing given some of the IRA projects. So just a little more color on that segment. Thanks.\nWard Nye: That's very helpful. Thank you so much. So look, if we're looking at data centers and what's coming from the build-out of AI, in particular, I mean, I can look at a big Google project in Kansas City that has got significant tonnage with it. I can look at actually Microsoft data centers oddly enough in Western North Carolina, near Hickory and our quarries in Mayton. Google, again, is establishing two new data centers, campuses in South Carolina. Those have a combined investment of about $3.3 billion. So again, it's one thing to see that degree of data centers going in. It's another to see the AI coming with or somewhere behind it. But the energy piece of this is going to be real. And the energy piece of it is going to be very, very aggregates intensive. And to your point, I'm shifting going from data warehousing to just warehousing. I mentioned before, I do believe that warehouse construction does appear to be cyclically bottoming right now. I mean we talked about that Amazon facility that's Cleburne, Texas. Again, if we just look at the quantum of aggregates and cement and concrete that will go into that, it's going to be really very, very significant. And then when we start thinking about the other light non-res demand that will likely come behind that, at least some -- those are some of the specifics, Timna, if you're just looking really from a micro perspective, what does some of the markets look like and what are we seeing from data that gives us a good sense of confidence around that. That's part of what we're looking at.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Thanks. And then on the infrastructure side, I wanted to ask kind of high level, I guess. I don't want to make you go through all the different state budgets again, but there has been a disappointment, as you know, since the 2021 passage of IIJA. There's been kind of a trickle or a slow processing of some of those dollars. What is it about 2025 that's really going to kick into gear? And how does that offset some of the cost inflation that's accumulated since it was passed? Thanks.\nWard Nye: Timna, I would say a couple of things. One, 2024 has really been the first year that we've seen significant or, frankly, any federal IIJA dollars coming through. So if you think about what that means as a branch of matter, you're seeing it for the very first year in 2024. And you're going to have some of that carryover into 2025. Then you're going to have new work that's being bid in 2025 as well. So I think the states are moving forward. And of course, the dialogue you and I were having a few minutes ago was largely built around those state budgets. At the same time, I think here's the big surprise, I think, in some respects. I think if somebody had said to us in 2021, hey, by the time you're in the last quarter of 2024, do you think you will have only seen 20-some percent of those dollars that had been authorized moving through the system? I think the answer would have been kind of that feels a little bit slow, but we know the dollars are there. We know the dollars are coming. And that's why I have the sense that look, if we're looking at the public side of it, should that be almost irrefutably better in '25 and '24 and continue to build in '26. Frankly, Timna, I think it almost has to, when we look at the federal dollars and we look at the state budgets and the geography in which we're operating. So that's the way that we've looked at that and basically handicapped it in our minds.\nTimna Tanners: Okay, very helpful. Thanks again.\nWard Nye: Most welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Our line is open.\nMichael Feniger: Great. Thank you, for squeezing me in. Just a clarification question, Ward. Your full year '24 shipment guide, obviously down 2.5% to 4%. If it was flat, if underlying demand was flat, how much weather do you think '24 versus '23 weighed on growth? Is it 1%, 2%? I guess the genesis of the question, Ward, is if you're growing low single-digit growth in 2025, that's organic, is the volume growth actually a little bit higher next year, barring weather just isn't a disaster?\nWard Nye: Michael, I think it certainly could be. And I think if we've done anything, I think we've taken a relatively thoughtful, cautious view of next year because I think if we go to it, I don't want to give percentages on what I think weather has done this year. But it would not be a small percentage on what weather has done this year. And keep in mind, last year, we had a weather year that was maybe normal to dry. This year, we've had one that has been epically wet. If we just hit something next year that feels normal, particularly in geographies that are disproportionately important to us like the Southeast. Look, I think there are a lot of moving parts that point to attractive trends and growth for next year.\nMichael Feniger: That's really helpful, Ward. And just a follow-up on the pricing, let's say, closer to the high single-digit range potentially. Is that relatively even through the year? Does that not include midyears? Is that more second half weighted? Just any kind of anecdotal kind of commentary you would like to think about, how we think about that preliminary '25 as that kind of moves through the year? Thank you.\nWard Nye: As you said, it is preliminary. And no, it does not take into account mid-years for next year, and that's typically the way that we do that. Even when we'll come back to you and give you more precision in February. It's usually not taking into account mid-year. So that simply gives it some degree of tailwind as well. So that's how I would encourage you to think about that.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call to Ward for closing remarks.\nWard Nye: Thank you again for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Martin Marietta's future is bright, thanks to the consistent and thoughtful execution of our strategic priorities by our world-class teams. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to continue delivering leading financial safety and operational performance while extending our long track record of delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ward Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacklyn, and thank you all for joining this teleconference. During the third quarter, we experienced a series of well-chronicled extreme weather events, including significant July precipitation together with Tropical Storm Debby in North Carolina, Hurricane Beryl in Texas and Hurricane Helene across much of our Southeast footprint. First and foremost, we're grateful that our employees and their families are safe. Our thoughts, prayers and ongoing support remain focused on those who have suffered so disproportionately during these natural disasters. We're particularly mindful of our neighbors in Western North Carolina as they begin the long process of rebuilding. Aside from the human cost of these events, we and a host of other businesses were affected by the storms. In our specific case, project delays and inefficiencies negatively impacted our financial results. And as a consequence, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.07 billion at the midpoint. To help better demonstrate the severity of these weather events during the last two quarters to our upstream product shipments, we provided two case studies on Page 8 of our supplemental information. The first case study is particularly revealing relative to cement. As you will recall, the second quarter's significant precipitation was particularly notable in Dallas-Fort Worth, our company's single largest market area, resulting in an 18% decline in our mid low-teen cement shipments. Encouragingly, as the weather improved, so did Midlothian's third quarter shipments. Shifting now to aggregates. Our implied fourth quarter shipment guide reflects a 5% increase in shipments, a notable improvement relative to the third quarter's 4% decline. Our fourth quarter view is primarily based on October's trends and reasonable expectations for the remainder of the year. These statistics demonstrate the important irony of disruptive and destructive weather. Planned shipments are not generally canceled, they're delayed. And depending on seasonality and severity, resumption of planned shipments usually occurs in the following months and/or quarters. Despite these weather-related events, I'm pleased to highlight some of our team's accomplishments. First, we achieved the best year-to-date safety incident rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Operationally, our teams achieved record quarterly aggregates gross profit per ton of $8.16, record third quarter cash flows from operations and record third quarter revenues and gross profit in our Magnesia Specialties business. Given the totality of the quarter's uncontrollable and exigent circumstances, these are notable records upon which we intend to build. With respect to continuing to build, in October, we acquired pure aggregate assets in South Florida and Southern California, both attractive and growing Martin Marietta markets. Consistent with our strategic operating analysis and review, or SOAR plan, these bolt-on acquisitions further enhance our gross profit contribution from the aggregates product line and improve the long-term durability of our business. Together, these accomplishments reflect our team's focus on matters we can control while underscoring the resiliency of our aggregates-led business, which is strategically positioned in the country's fastest-growing markets. Importantly, these results reinforce our expectation that our aggregates price cost spread will continue to expand over time, driving improvement in unit profitability through macroeconomic cycles. As we look towards 2025, we remain focused on the long-term aspects of our business that we can meaningfully impact, world-class safety, the consistent and disciplined execution of our strategic plan, resolute adherence to our leading commercial strategy and prudent cost management through ongoing operational excellence efforts. Equally, we expect product shipments will recover due to more normal weather patterns and an expected improvement in warehouse and residential construction. Preliminarily, we expect that 2025 overall aggregate shipments will increase by low single-digits and aggregates pricing will increase by mid to high single-digits. Moving now to end market trends. Regardless of the outcome of the upcoming elections, both rebuilding and maintaining our nation's infrastructure remains a bipartisan national strategic priority. Record levels of state and federal investment through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, or IIJA, continue to support attractive demand for highways and streets construction. And while growth rates in contract awards have predictably flattened, as reflected in the value of contract awards for the 12-month period ending August 31, 2024, the baseline for highway and street spending is well above historical levels. Looking ahead, funding certainty at the state and federal level will provide volume stability and support a healthy pricing environment in this aggregate intensive, often countercyclical end market for years to come. Relative to heavy nonresidential construction, the build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure supports emerging growth trends in both data centers and related energy requirements. Moreover, aggregates-intensive warehouse construction appears to be cyclically bottoming in select markets, as indicated by recent project announcements. For example, Amazon is planning to build one of its largest North American distribution centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with our leading aggregates position, strategic and large capacity cement plant, and affiliated ready mixed presence in this dynamic market, Martin Marietta is uniquely positioned to supply materials to this project, which is expected to begin later this year. Shifting now to light nonresidential and residential activity, housing availability and affordability remain key issues impacting single-family demand. While a correction of these issues will not be immediate, we believe that loosening monetary policy is an important first step. It passed its prologue, and we believe that to be the case as residential construction recovers, light nonresidential activity typically follows. In summary, we believe multiyear public construction activity, reshoring, the artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out and the long-awaited single-family housing-led residential recovery all call us to support durable aggregate shipment growth and continued attractive pricing momentum for years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. As our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate, Martin Marietta remains focused on matters we can control, an unwavering commitment to safety and the environment, commercial and operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic priorities. We have thoughtfully shaped and expanded our aggregates-led portfolio and deliberately built our business with leading positions in the nation's fastest-growing markets, making Martin Marietta an increasingly resilient, efficient and cash flow generative business that can consistently drive shareholder value creation. With these attractive underlying fundamentals, our best-in-class teams, unparalleled growth opportunities and proven strategic priorities, we're excited about the prospects in 2025 and beyond. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Kathryn, thanks for the question. It's a good one because that really does highlight much of what happened in the quarter. Several things that I would say. Number one, as we discussed before, Q2 in its own way, was a washout. And Q3 was as well, from a weather perspective, which is why we put that supplemental slide on Page 8 in the deck today because I think it does give good color relative to how significant the weather events were to our shipments. So as you can see, if you look at that slide, Q2 was really severe in DFW, and as Q3 rolled around, it wasn't as bad in DFW, and you saw a really nice snapback in volumes at Midlothian. Now Q3 was just tough across the Southeast and much of the East. Look, here's your takeaway. We literally had a hurricane every 2.5 weeks in Q3. And they were coming through and disproportionately hitting our Eastern business and a lot of it, frankly, our Southeastern business. And to your point, Kathryn, if we're looking at businesses that have our highest ASPs, if we're looking at businesses that have our highest margins, that's the sweet spot. And that's the part that really was hit hard, hard, hard in the quarter. So if we're looking at it overall, did it affect the shipments? I think, notably. Disproportionate drive our shipments down, absolutely. It was a disproportionate driver of what happened to the profitability because of the wear. And then the other piece of it is it made it more difficult in some instances to get the same degree of midyear price increases this year that we saw last year. So you really had almost a trifecta of issues that went through. Now to the second part of your question, it's a good one. I was reading the Wall Street Journal this morning, it was talking about much of the country being in some degree of a drought in October. And the fact is October has been much more normal. And what we've seen in October is really what is driving what you've seen relative to our aggregate forecast going forward because if you look at it, what it's basically saying is we're anticipating aggregates to be up 5% in Q4. And that's really on the back of what we're seeing in October. So several things I would note, as I think about the durability and how real that is. One, we're seeing the tonnage. Two, we're seeing our customers continue to add to their backlogs. So we're seeing nice sequential build in customer backlogs. And the other thing to me that's telling is our customers are hiring right now, too. So when you're seeing good activity that we're seeing in October when we're seeing dry weather, when we're seeing good activity from backlog from a customer perspective, and we're seeing contractors hiring right now, we think all of those together give a nice picture of what's to come. But when you step back from it, too, it answers, I think, the essence of your question. How much did weather matter? Answer, it mattered a lot. How much did it matter relative to volume? A lot. How much does it matter relative to profitability? Frankly, even more than it did relative to volume. So Kathryn, I hope that helps. Thank you, Kathryn. Yes. Yes, Trey, it is in our backyard, and you're right. And Western North Carolina did feel that, the words that I gave in the prepared remarks were disproportionately, so we are trying to make sure that we're doing all we can to help that part of the state rebuild. I mean, here are some data points for you. NCDOT estimates that the Helene recovery expenses will be between $5 billion and $6 billion, just relative to NCDOT. Now to put some other color to that, typically, the federal government reimbursement rate for that is between 60% and 65%, which means as a practical matter, North Carolina's share of that burden is going to be about $2 billion. Now as we think about how we're positioned to help rebuild that part of the state, several things I'd point to. Number one, we have operations in North Carolina that go nicely west of Hickory. So we're getting into the foothills, getting into the Appalachians with our North Carolina operations. It's important to remember, too, that with the Blue Water transaction, we actually acquired a number of sites in Eastern Tennessee. So that now puts us into a position that we can come into those areas, both from Eastern Tennessee and Western North Carolina to make sure we're providing the work and the support that, that area is going to need. Now importantly, too, NCDOT has said that it's going to be business as usual in terms of construction and maintenance activity outside of the work for Helene. So we're not going to see other parts of the state not continuing to advance. North Carolina can do that and take care of what's happening relative to Helene. And I think this is an important piece of it, too, Trey, because when we talk about SOAR and where we have built our business and why. One of the areas that we've long said is we want to be in states that are in a good fiscal condition because when these type of things happen, we need to be in places that states can manage that. And it was interesting, I was reading a piece in the Pew Trust last week, and it outlined that North Carolina was only one of a handful of states, literally, that use a budget stress test to determine how much should be set aside in its rainy day fund. And the state currently has a surplus of $6 billion in that. And if you're keeping score at home, that's about $4.25 billion more than we saw in the last budget. So will there be rebuilding? Yes. Is it going to be extensive? Yes. Will it take not months or years, but probably the better part of a decade? My guess is that it will and will be there to help, absolutely. You bet. Thank you, Trey. Garik, thanks for the question. Yeah, I can help you with that a little bit. So number one, both these transactions are totally consistent with SOAR. And what I mean by that is you've seen us historically go into relatively new markets for Marietta like we did in California or Florida in this instance. And we basically do platform transactions and then we come behind them with a series of bolt-ons where we can augment our position. That's exactly what you're seeing in both of these deals. So I would tell you several things. One, both are complementary. They are both pure aggregate bolt-ons. So again, one in the High West in Southern California, one where we bought Blue Water. Equally, and I think this is important, both our percentage margin and unit margin accretive. So these are attractive, pure stone businesses. The combined reserves are over 150 million tons in areas with notable reserve shortages. So again, we continue to augment our reserve position in those markets. Integration is going to be complete very, very quickly. New pricing will be effective on January 1. What's important is doing all of these together and with both these transactions, it's still sub $1 billion on what we've done. Our leverage remains completely within our target range, and the pipeline of aggregates acquisitions remains active. So we think there's more to come on that. Relative to the guide for the rest of this year, we've effectively put nothing in the guide for the rest of this year for these businesses because as you recall, the tyranny of purchase price accounting in this means that we had to take all of the inventory there and mark it up to fair market value. So what you anticipate after a transaction is for those early months, you're not going to see that much from a P&L perspective. But these transactions, frankly, Garik, like so much of this year has been a setup for 2025. This puts us in better positions in markets where we want to have these leading positions. These are attractive pure stone transactions. And again, we believe the commercial trends that we will see at these operations will continue to be very attractive. And part of what I think is worth noting as well. If we go back and take a look at even the Blue Water transactions that we've done, and what we've done relative to getting those businesses back up to something that looks more like Martin Marietta market pricing, when you and I had this conversation at Q2, there was about a $5 a ton delta on ASP between the acquired operations and heritage at that point. Now that's about $3 a ton. So I think if you take the overall philosophy that we have, look at the geographies in which we've made these transactions, what the reserve base looks like and what it can mean in our heritage business and acquired businesses, as you can tell probably from my tone and words, we're pretty excited about these deals. Thanks, Garik. Hi, Jerry. No, happy to. So, it's several things. Answering the back part of your question first. I just think we're going to see good, steady durable pricing going forward. Look, I think that mid- to high probably, with an emphasis on high, is probably the right way to think of it next year because one, we're just going to see more price in our heritage businesses. Number two, we're going to continue to see the acquisitions move up nicely. If we think about what happened just here in the last three months, I think several things very candidly, One, did weather impacted delays from a geographic mix perspective caused some headwinds? You bet. If we're looking also at what some of the geographic mix has been, meaning we're selling more fines or other lower-priced materials, that was the piece of it as well. And when you take the weather-impacted delays and the other issues faced with the year, we did see a lower percentage of midyear price increases this year than we saw last year. That's nothing that causes me any concern as I look at it. I think this year was faced with some very challenging near-term dynamics that helped drive that, which means the carry over next year is smaller than it was this year. So we're only looking at about 80 basis points that are carry over for next year. So I think that gives you a sense as we think about the build, the type of resolve we have around a very good marketplace next year with respect to pricing. And again, what I'm taken by, Jerry, is it's hard to produce what we produce on a spec market basis and put it out there and sell it for what we sell it for. I continue to believe that the value of what we're putting on the ground and the value that we add to overall construction is still something that has some running room ahead of it for all the right reasons. But I hope that answers your question. Thank you, Jerry. Good morning. Thank you for the question, Anthony. I think it certainly does. And if we're looking at current backlogs, I mean, they are up very nicely relative to the prior year quarter and sequentially as well, both in the mid-single-digits range right now. So when you're sitting there at this point of the year with that degree of up with what I think is a lot of upside ahead of us, that's what starts to give us a sense of that next year clearly is going to be a much improved year relative to volume. If we think about end users all by themselves, there's no reason, from my perspective, that we shouldn't expect public to be better, frankly, for the next couple of years at least. If we look at the IIJA funds that are actually in the system today, I mean, what's been obligated is one thing. What's actually been spent and what's been reimbursed is actually considerably lower. And frankly, it's in the 20% range right now. So there's so much more of that to come. And then when we tackle that together with state DOT budgets, that are actually in a very good position. I gave a little bit of color a few minutes ago where North Carolina is just in a host of different perspectives. But again, if we're looking at our top 10 states, 80-plus-percent of those actually see their budgets up for next year. Equally, if we look at resi, we believe, clearly, resi is not going to be something that's going to turn on a dime, but we are seeing that, we believe, beginning to turn with some green shoots in a series of markets. And frankly, we almost have to see it. The population dynamic trends have been so significant in the states in which we have leading positions, that the single-family housing market is in dire need of greater activity. But I think importantly, too, and you heard me mention in the prepared remarks, when we're seeing things like suddenly warehousing showing some degrees of green shoots. Obviously, that has been a sector of heavy non-res that has been looking for bottom for a while. We think it's really finding bottom. And now when we're seeing Amazon put in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, one of its largest facilities in North America, we think that's the moment. But equally, as we start thinking about AI and what that's going to mean and energy and what that's going to mean and the reassuring that we know is coming. These, to me, underscore what I believe will be a nice, steady sequential multiyear build. It should be that. And then relative to the light non-res, keep in mind, that's actually been better over the last couple of quarters on a percentage basis of our volume than heavy non-res has been. And that tells me, as we see a res recovery, we're likely to see a more quickly than usual recovery in light non-res. So I think those things, as we build them together, Anthony, is what gives us a high degree of confidence next year and what we're talking about on volumes. I do think, as a company, I do think as an industry, we're usually pretty good at having a good feel for what's happening commercially. I'm not sure that we're always great on knowing precision, what's going to happen with volumes. So I think if we've done anything, we'd probably err to the side of being relatively cautious with respect to our volume outlook next year, and that still has us up. Thank you, Anthony. No, happy to. And I'll ask Jim to take you through what we're seeing from an inflation perspective and otherwise. Thank you, Angel. No. Look, great questions, Angel. Thank you so much for that. So short answer is no, no. Q4 is not taking into account anything from the new acquisitions. And again, we talked a little bit about the purchase price accounting. I'm sorry, Phil. And so it doesn't have anything in there for Q4. And again, we'll come back and really factor those into the guide when we come back to you in February, Phil, and give you a better feel for what we think 2025 will look like. And that's where you will see the Southern California and South Florida transactions factored into it. I hope that helps. That's correct. Yes, Phil. You got it. You bet. Take care. Hey, good morning, Tyler. Welcome. Thank you, Tyler. Thanks for the question. The short answer is, this is going to be a ramp-up period for that. Look, that's an important marketplace to us. We want to go about that in a very thoughtful way. Midlothian is performing actually very well right now. I mean it's been interesting that we actually saw improved gross profit per ton at Midlothian. We've seen very constructive pricing in Midlothian, which tells you what a different marketplace in North Texas is from many others. And so we will be very thoughtful. We'll be very careful and we'll be very methodical about how we go about that at Midlothian. So short answer is, don't expect all of that next year, expect that over a period of time, and yes, it will ramp. Thank you. Hi, David. Yeah. No, I don't know that we've ever come out with precise tonnage on that. But what I would refer you back to, take a look at Blue Water and take a look at Frei because those are really the two different transactions to which that metric applies. So it's really going to mean Denver in one instance. Central and Eastern Tennessee in another, and in primarily portions of Northern Alabama. Obviously, the Blue Water transaction covered more states than that. But from a gravity perspective, that's most of it, David. We are largely caught up in California. That's exactly right. That's a great question. I mean there's just not a lot of import activity that goes into DFW to begin with because the transportation logistics becomes so complicated, getting it there by some form of either river or ocean going vessel then offloading then going through the boards then putting it on trucks and then sending it a long way. So look, I think Dallas Worth, simply because of its location that far from water is different. I think Dallas Fort Worth, because of the overall economy in DFW, I mean when we bought TXI, we bought it in large measure, not exclusively thinking the Dallas-Fort Worth would probably be the best-looking heavy side building materials market in the United States for the next 25 or 30 years. And we've been right on that. And I don't see anything that makes us change our view on it. So is it already a good market? Yes. Do we anticipate it's going to stay a good market? Yes. What I answer your question, look, if tariffs come in, does it make a really good market look even better? The answer is yeah, I think it does. Thank you, David. Hi, Mike. Mike, thanks for the question. I would say several things. One, as we discussed earlier in the call, the pricing dynamic that we needed to address in California has largely been addressed. And now we have a more formidable business there with the M&A that we've done. So I would continue to think in particular that Southern California would be a marketplace that should be a relatively bright spot for us. Number two, I would say Texas is going to continue to be a bright spot for us. Clearly, North Texas, as I look at the market, I really think of it, North Texas, Central Texas, South Texas in those three buckets. I think North Texas is going to continue to be the strongest of those markets. I think Central Texas is going to be absolutely fine as well. And again, the TxDOT program there shows growth going into next year. again, Florida will continue to be an important market for us for 2 different reasons. One, we've historically been the largest importer of granite into that market. So we had a disproportionate infrastructure view in that marketplace. Now though that we're getting in-state operations that can really start feeding more concrete and feed more private work, we're going to see continuing attractive work in Florida. If we think about North Carolina, we've gone through that. One, the DOT program is up year-over-year. Number two, we've talked about what would be of necessity, a significant rebuild in the western part of the state and we think that will continue to be attractive. But equally, if we look at Indiana, their budget's up next year. If we look at Georgia, their budget's up almost -- it's over 7% next year. Colorado's budget is up 14%. Arizona's budget is equally up double digits next year. So if I'm thinking about overall end users, I mean, that clearly addresses it relative to the public side. And I've said earlier, that ought to be good for at least a couple of years. Equally, as we think about private in those states, those are all fast-growing states that have seen significant population trends. So my view is the long-term, and medium term and near-term volume picture ought to be increasingly attractive and long term, medium and short term, the commercial side and the pricing piece of it ought to outkick whatever historical coverage is. That's going to continue to perform in ways that I will think will be a differentiator relative to other industrial sectors. You're most welcome. I'm sorry, Timna. I didn't mean to interrupt. Was there more, Timna? I didn't mean to interrupt you. That's very helpful. Thank you so much. So look, if we're looking at data centers and what's coming from the build-out of AI, in particular, I mean, I can look at a big Google project in Kansas City that has got significant tonnage with it. I can look at actually Microsoft data centers oddly enough in Western North Carolina, near Hickory and our quarries in Mayton. Google, again, is establishing two new data centers, campuses in South Carolina. Those have a combined investment of about $3.3 billion. So again, it's one thing to see that degree of data centers going in. It's another to see the AI coming with or somewhere behind it. But the energy piece of this is going to be real. And the energy piece of it is going to be very, very aggregates intensive. And to your point, I'm shifting going from data warehousing to just warehousing. I mentioned before, I do believe that warehouse construction does appear to be cyclically bottoming right now. I mean we talked about that Amazon facility that's Cleburne, Texas. Again, if we just look at the quantum of aggregates and cement and concrete that will go into that, it's going to be really very, very significant. And then when we start thinking about the other light non-res demand that will likely come behind that, at least some -- those are some of the specifics, Timna, if you're just looking really from a micro perspective, what does some of the markets look like and what are we seeing from data that gives us a good sense of confidence around that. That's part of what we're looking at. Timna, I would say a couple of things. One, 2024 has really been the first year that we've seen significant or, frankly, any federal IIJA dollars coming through. So if you think about what that means as a branch of matter, you're seeing it for the very first year in 2024. And you're going to have some of that carryover into 2025. Then you're going to have new work that's being bid in 2025 as well. So I think the states are moving forward. And of course, the dialogue you and I were having a few minutes ago was largely built around those state budgets. At the same time, I think here's the big surprise, I think, in some respects. I think if somebody had said to us in 2021, hey, by the time you're in the last quarter of 2024, do you think you will have only seen 20-some percent of those dollars that had been authorized moving through the system? I think the answer would have been kind of that feels a little bit slow, but we know the dollars are there. We know the dollars are coming. And that's why I have the sense that look, if we're looking at the public side of it, should that be almost irrefutably better in '25 and '24 and continue to build in '26. Frankly, Timna, I think it almost has to, when we look at the federal dollars and we look at the state budgets and the geography in which we're operating. So that's the way that we've looked at that and basically handicapped it in our minds. Most welcome. Michael, I think it certainly could be. And I think if we've done anything, I think we've taken a relatively thoughtful, cautious view of next year because I think if we go to it, I don't want to give percentages on what I think weather has done this year. But it would not be a small percentage on what weather has done this year. And keep in mind, last year, we had a weather year that was maybe normal to dry. This year, we've had one that has been epically wet. If we just hit something next year that feels normal, particularly in geographies that are disproportionately important to us like the Southeast. Look, I think there are a lot of moving parts that point to attractive trends and growth for next year. As you said, it is preliminary. And no, it does not take into account mid-years for next year, and that's typically the way that we do that. Even when we'll come back to you and give you more precision in February. It's usually not taking into account mid-year. So that simply gives it some degree of tailwind as well. So that's how I would encourage you to think about that. Thank you again for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Martin Marietta's future is bright, thanks to the consistent and thoughtful execution of our strategic priorities by our world-class teams. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to continue delivering leading financial safety and operational performance while extending our long track record of delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results in February. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and your support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, the Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.8 billion, a 6% decrease, and gross profit of $588 million, a 9% decrease. The decline in both metrics is due to the February divestiture of our South Texas cement and related concrete businesses, along with shipment declines in all product lines, partially offset by acquisition contributions. Aggregates gross profit per ton improved 3% to a quarterly record of $8.16, notwithstanding lower shipment volumes, highlighting the efficacy of our value over volume commercial strategy. Aggregates pricing increased 7.7% or 8.9% on an organic mix-adjusted basis. Cement and concrete revenues decreased 30% to $296 million, and gross profit decreased 37% to $89 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations. I'm pleased to report the construction of our new finished mill at Midlothian is complete, which will provide us with approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in the attractive North Texas market. Asphalt and paving revenues decreased 5% to $343 million, and gross profit decreased 8% to $61 million. Wet weather, project delays and a softer nonresidential market drove the shipment decline, while lower revenues and higher aggregates costs negatively impacted profitability. Magnesia Specialties posted record third quarter revenues and gross profit of $82 million and $29 million, respectively, as benefits from strong pricing and improved lime shipments more than offset lower chemical shipments. Turning now to capital allocation and liquidity. As Ward mentioned, we achieved record third quarter cash flows from operations of $601 million, an increase of 32% as compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to working capital improvements that more than offset lower net earnings. Consistent with our long-standing capital allocation priorities, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we deployed over $2.5 billion on pure-play aggregates assets, invested $622 million of capital back into our business and returned $591 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In our 30 years as a publicly traded company, we have steadily maintained or increased our dividend, and this year is no exception. During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase to the quarterly cash dividend paid in September, reaffirming our confidence in the durability and sustainability of our company's future growth and free cash flow generation. We have now returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.0 times for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, preserving financial flexibility to continue actively pursuing value-enhancing high-quality aggregates acquisitions and prudently reinvesting in our business all while returning capital to Martin Marietta shareholders through dividend growth and opportunistic share repurchases. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. Yeah. So the underlying inflation for this quarter was actually coming close to where we expected, about mid-single-digits, call it, 5%. The additional COGS per ton inflation we saw was largely due to our inventory drawdown for the quarter. And that will continue probably a little bit into next quarter. But for 2025 in total, I would -- I'm still sticking with my mid-single-digit cost inflation view overall, which would be obviously well below where Ward clearly enunciated our ASP expectations are mid to high single-digits. So the price/cost spread should continue to trend favorably. And again, inflation, if anything, it seems to be trending down. So more to come on that next year. We'll come up with after Q4 earnings. Yeah. So it's largely a function of the two acquisitions that Ward mentioned. One of those is structured in a way that's being treated as CapEx, and that is an operational acquisition. So that bump up in CapEx guide for the year is almost solely attributable to that deal. And next year, we typically guide to 9%, 9.5% of revenues. So probably not a bad way to think about it to start for next year. We'll have more detail next year, though."

A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Company's website. I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin.\nJacklyn Rooker: Good morning. It\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to Martin Marietta's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Howard Nye, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States Securities Laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's websites. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website. Howard Nye will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our second quarter operating performance and our Blue Water Industries acquisition, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2024 in current market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide closing comments. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to one question. I will now turn the call over to Ward.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn, and thank you all for joining this teleconference. As indicated in today's earnings release, several dynamics impacted our second quarter financial results and particularly product shipments. The most notable driver was an historic 119% increase in precipitation in Dallas-Fort Worth our company's single largest and most profitable metropolitan marketplace as well as disproportionate rain and flooding in parts of the Midwest. Secondarily, the lag effect of restrictive monetary policy is pressuring interest rate-sensitive private construction demand more than previously anticipated. And while our value over volume philosophy also contributed modestly to the shipment decline, the benefits of our commercial strategy are clearly evidenced by the second quarter strong unit profitability growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Moving forward, our team remains focused on what we can control, and view the demand impacts from weather and high interest rates is temporary. That said, we expect slower shipment trends to persist in the year's second half. As a result, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.2 billion at the midpoint. While second quarter shipments were below our initial expectations, there were notable highlights worthy of mention as foundational for Martin Marietta's long-term success. Starting first with Safety, I'm proud to report that we concluded the first half of 2024 with the best Safety incidents rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Operationally, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin and achieved record second quarter organic and total aggregates gross profit despite significant weather headwinds. Importantly, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with aggregates average selling price increasing 11.6% or 12% on an organic mix-adjusted basis. We expect this commercial momentum and related margin expansion to continue following realization of our previously announced July pricing actions. These accomplishments underscore the resiliency of our aggregates-led business reinforced by our teams' fidelity to maintaining a safe workplace and our unrelenting commitment to both commercial and operational excellence. From a portfolio optimization standpoint, on April 5, we completed the acquisition of 20 aggregates operations from Blue Water Industries, and in so doing, efficiently redeploy the cash proceeds from the South Texas cement and concrete divestiture. These high-quality pure-play aggregates operations from Blue Water strategically complement our existing footprint in the Southeastern United States and position us in attractive new markets including Tennessee and South Florida for future growth. I'm pleased to report that the integration of both the Blue Water and Albert Frei & Sons acquisitions is complete. The combined financial performance has exceeded management's initial expectations, and the synergy realization will be increasingly compelling. Moving forward, the M&A pipeline remains active and largely focused on pure-play aggregates businesses and attractive or identified geographies. Shifting now to end market trends, our single most aggregates-intensive end use is infrastructure, which continues to benefit from increased funding and investment levels, while highway and street spending is expected to remain well above historic levels, leading indicators are predictably starting to lap more robust comparable periods. This is evidenced in the value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, which declined modestly below 2023 levels to $114 billion. Funding certainty at the federal level through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, together with record state DOT budgets and constituent actions support a healthy pricing environment for construction materials in 2025 and beyond. With the 2024 election process well underway, it's important to note rebuilding and enhancing our nation's infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities remain bipartisan, national strategic priorities, as revealed by the high passage rates on local infrastructure ballot initiatives and three key legislative actions, the IIJA, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Moving now to heavy non-residential construction, reshoring activity for large manufacturing and energy projects continues to drive product demand. Aside from warehouse construction, which is contracting from its post-COVID peak, starts on a square footage basis remained well above what were healthy in 2019 levels. While not wholly offsetting, construction spending for domestic manufacturing continues to trend positively with the June 2024 seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending at $236 billion, a 19% increase from the June 2023 value of $198 billion. Importantly, the breadth of reshoring projects is expanding from automotive, batteries and semiconductors to pharmaceuticals. For example, Novo Nordisk is investing $4 billion to build a 1.4 million square foot manufacturing facility near Raleigh, North Carolina, which we're well positioned to supply from our nearby quarries. In addition, while artificial intelligence is in its early stages, Martin Marietta is geographically well positioned to capitalize on the related data center and infrastructure build-out led by big tech, including Amazon, whose announced plans to invest more than $100 billion over the next decade on data centers alone. Relative to light non-residential and residential activity, restrictive monetary policy continues to impact these interest rate sensitive end markets. The lock-in effect of high mortgage rates and low inventory are only serving to exacerbate the well-chronicled housing affordability and availability issues in many of our company's key metropolitan areas. That said, recent inflation and employment data should provide the foundation for accommodative Federal Reserve policy actions later this year and into 2025. I encourage you to read more on this as discussed in the CEO commentary and market perspective, released earlier today. Beyond 2024, we expect the generational highway and street investments as the nascent reshoring and artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out are very much expected to provide an extended multiyear construction cycle in these aggregates intensive end markets. Equally, when the affordability headwinds recede, we fully expect an accelerated housing construction recovery, specifically in single family, which will be required to address the structural deficit of homes in many of Martin Marietta's key markets. Importantly, as history informs us, growth in single-family construction bodes well for light non-residential activity, which typically follows with a lag, but in this instance, a lag, which we believe will be more abbreviated than previous cycles. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter financial results. Jim?\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned and shown in today's release, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.2 billion at the midpoint, reflecting our first half results and revised second half shipment expectations. In the second quarter, the Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 3% and gross profit of $501 million, a decrease of 7%. The decline in both metrics is attributable to the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and related concrete businesses as well as shipment declines experienced in the quarter, most notably due to wet weather, partially offset by contributions of the Albert Frei & Sons and Blue Water acquisitions. The net positive impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the second quarter was $7 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our aggregates pipeline established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit as contributions from acquired operations and strong pricing more than offset lower shipments. Aggregates gross profit per ton improved 9% to a second quarter record of $7.41. That number is inclusive of the $20 million or $0.37 per ton non-recurring, non-cash purchase accounting impact of the fair market value write-up of inventory related to the Blue Water acquisition, which was fully recognized in the second quarter. Excluding this purchase accounting impact, gross profit per ton increased 14%. These impressive results reveal and affirm how our disciplined commercial strategy and flexible cost structure yields higher profits despite lower volumes. Cement and concrete revenue decreased 37% to $261 million, and gross profit decreased 44% to $72 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas Cement plant and its related concrete operations and secondarily, by significant wet April, May and early June weather in Dallas-Fort Worth. Notably, our strategic Midlothian cement plants daily shipping rates returned to near sold-out levels exiting the quarter. Remember, too, we expect our new finish mill [ph] to be operational in the third quarter, which has the capacity to add approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in the attractive North Texas market. Our asphalt and paving revenues and gross profit increased modestly to $245 million and $37 million, respectively, both second quarter records in large measure due to pricing improvements and energy cost tailwinds. Magnesia Specialties revenues of $81 million were in line with the prior year quarter, while gross profit decreased 2% to $27 million. Strong pricing, improved maintenance cost management and energy cost tailwinds, counterbalance lower chemicals and lime shipments. SOAR has long provided the framework we use to grow our business and deploy capital for long-term success. During the first half of this year, we deployed over $2.5 billion on pure-play aggregates acquisitions, invested $339 million of capital into our business and returned $542 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the second quarter alone, we repurchased 530,000 shares at an average price of $566 per share. Since our repurchase authorization announced in February 2015, we returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2 times as of June 30, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, providing balance sheet strength and ample flexibility to actively pursue our M&A pipeline, reinvest in our business and extend our long track record of returning capital to Martin Marietta shareholders, all while preserving financial flexibility and our investment-grade credit rating profile. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward.\nHoward Nye: Thanks, Jim. In 2024, Martin Marietta is proudly celebrating our 30th year as a publicly-traded company. Our three decades of success has been the result of an unwavering commitment to safety and the disciplined execution of our proven strategy. As we plan for the next 30 years, we're confident Martin Marietta is well positioned to continue leading our industry's evolution while at the same time, navigating through inevitable macroeconomic cycles and driving sustainable, attractive growth. We remain committed to building and maintaining the safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led business and look forward to delivering superior shareholder value for our stakeholders for years and decades to come. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your line is open. Please ask your question.\nKathryn Thompson: Hi, thank you for taking my question today. The first is focused on Q2 and just better understanding the impact of how much of it was market, maybe more color on the volume impact in the quarter? And then part and parcel with that, how should we think about the balance of Q3 and Q4 in terms of how profitability should flow through, given some of the obvious weather content you and your peers have been facing? Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Good morning, Kathryn, thank you for the question. So look, weather was a big deal in Q2, there's no doubt about it. So I said in the prepared remarks that it was 119% weather in DFW this year than it was last year. And the fact is if you look at what happened in North Texas all by itself, but then you couple that with what happened in the Central division. And what I suppose is most people don't think about the Central division as being impactful to us as it is. Really, if we're looking at Dallas itself and the Central division together, those two areas of business typically represent nearly 40% of our Q2 shipments. So if we're looking at significant rain in Dallas and significant rain and flooding in the Midwest, that was really a serious body blow to the business. And what I like about that is it took that blow and came in with record aggregates profitability, record unit profitability and did all of that taking on the $20 million of inventory fair markup that we've totally absorbed in Q2. So seeing what happened in Dallas was important, understanding what happened in the Midwest was important. But I was also taken with the resiliency of our cement business in North Texas. Again, we've long defined what equals strategic cement for us. And clearly, what we have in that market is just that. I mean, we saw organic shipment volumes down about 18%, and again, that was all driven by rain, but pricing up nearly 10% and with very, very good performance. And as Jim indicated in his comments, we were seeing that marketplace turn to near sold-out levels as soon as the rain abated. So those were issues, I think, 50% at least of what we saw in the quarter was attributable to rain. Do I think a portion of it was attributable to the economy? Yes, probably 25% of it. So what am I seeing there? It's really what we indicated private construction because of what's happening with interest rates are seeing degrees of modest pullback. But the important thing to remember there, Kathryn, is we don't see markets that are overbuilt today in Martin Marietta marketplaces. So we feel like that's going to be fleeting. But equally, value over volume cost us some tonnage during the quarter. But the fact is we're perfectly okay with that. Again, we monitor that. We're going to be thoughtful around it. But again, we're seeing continued expanded adjusted EBITDA margins in what we're doing. We feel like the breakdown we've had between weather at 50%, market at 25% and value over volume at about 25% makes sense. But the other part of your question went to the cadence of how we think about the quarters. Let me turn that over to Jim to talk you through that a bit because that is going to change modestly.\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. Last year, Kathryn, second half of the year, about 60% of consolidated EBITDA came through in Q3 and 40% came through in Q4. Because of what we're seeing this year with weather, et cetera, in July and even August, the split is probably closer to 55% Q3, 45% in Q4, so a little bit more Q4 weighted this year than normal.\nKathryn Thompson: Okay. Perfect. And just one follow-up, if I may. Just on the outlook when you look at backlogs or jobs in the Q. What are you seeing in terms of project types and how are -- how is pricing on these type of projects, which obviously play into margins? Thanks very much.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Kathryn. Look, if we're looking at customer backlogs, they're up sequentially so they continue to build. Number one, I think that's important. Number two, if we're looking at the nature of the projects, look, infrastructure is going to be a good end use for several years, and we see that continuing. If we're looking at non-res, we're seeing degrees of shifts there. And by the way, that's not a surprise to us. So are we seeing more factories? The answer is yes. Are we seeing good pricing that goes with that? The answer is yes. Are we seeing good steady work and growing work, frankly, relative to energy? The answer is yes. Are we seeing growing work relative to data centers for all the reasons that I indicated in the prepared remarks, and in the commentary that we published today, that continues to grow. Obviously, warehousing is not. That's not a surprise to anyone. And what we're seeing is you almost have 2 lanes of traveling. You have data centers in one lane and they're going in a positive direction, and warehousing is going in the other, and you're seeing those percentages almost past each other on a precise precision or percentage basis today. So that's the type of work that we're seeing. The other thing that we're beginning to see, and this is more in Georgia. It's in North Carolina. It's in South Carolina. We're seeing green shoots and degrees of single-family housing right now. And again, that's not a big surprise simply because of the population dynamics. And again, relative to housing, we're such a small portion of the overall housing that traditionally in single-family housing back to the essence of your question, that tends to be very attractive priced materials, Kathryn. So I hope that's helpful.\nKathryn Thompson: Thanks so much and best of luck.\nHoward Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nStanley Elliott: Hey good morning everyone. Nice work despite this difficult environment. Ward, could you maybe walk us through kind of the revised guide, some of the puts and takes and see maybe what will get us to the high end versus the low end just as we're sitting here today kind of halfway through the year?\nHoward Nye: You bet. Happy to. And Stanley, thank you for your comments. We appreciate it. I'm with you. I think that was actually a very good performance, given what our team managed through. So several things. Let's start with pricing. So as you've seen, we've reaffirmed our pricing guide of 11% to 13% up, and that includes the previously announced midyears for California for the Frei business, for Blue Water locations as well as the targeted product and market-specific mid-years in other geographies. And by the way, that's pretty typical for us. The one thing that I think is going to be important this year relative to the midyears, so much volume that had already been bid at the January 1 pricing is still yet to go because of the deferral that we've seen. So typically, in a year, I've always told you historically. You could probably see about 1/4 of the midyears really show up in any given year in which they're put in. I think the midyears are going to be notably more impactful in '25. In other words, when we come back to you in January and talk about our guide for next year, I think you're going to see more mid-years affecting that this year than not. So that's how we're thinking about the ASP in the guide. Relative to volumes, clearly, that reflects an impacted first half results and early \u2013 other \u2013 here in the second half of the year. July was wet and we're sitting here today as tropical storm Debbie is going through the Carolinas. So we're living that. And so we're trying to take our experience with those events and really build that into the volume guide for the second half of the year. So we feel confident that we've hit that with as much clarity as we can given the circumstances. Look, relative to what will be expected as lower shipment levels. So our teams are going to be focused, as you would imagine, is too. Very much on cost control and making sure we're flexing our costs with demand. So we're very focused on that. The other thing that I think you'll see is given the inventory builds that we had with wet weather, where we're producing but not selling, there's going to be a little bit of inventory drawdown, and that's going to impact us a bit in half two. And it can provide a modest headwind to EBITDA. But again, we've taken that into account in what we put out there for you. One thing to keep in mind, too, is we're looking at the EBITDA guide, and I think this is something that's easy to forget. We grew EBITDA in 2023 by 33%. And I mean that's a really big number. And it gives you a difficult year compare. But at the same time, we're seeing EBITDA margin grow. And even at the guide, we're looking at a two-year CAGR of high teens, getting close to 17%, getting close to 20%. So again, numbers that we're very proud of, numbers that we feel good about as we're going into the second half of the year. And then at a foundation, particularly relative to pricing that we think puts us in a very attractive place as we start increasingly thinking about 2025, Stanley.\nStanley Elliott: Perfect, Ward. Thanks so much for the color and best of luck in the back half of the year.\nHoward Nye: Thanks, Stanley.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your lines are open. Please ask your question.\nTrey Grooms: Hey, good morning, everyone. And I'll echo Stanley's comment about the good work in a tough environment.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Trey, very much.\nTrey Grooms: So I guess I've got really -- the main one I wanted to talk about was kind of you've seen some slowing or maybe a little bit of deceleration you mentioned on the -- kind of on the activity front, in addition to weather, there was some of that. And Warden, you've broken out in the past, I think as recently as the last call, infrastructure and kind of your expectation for the year, I think, was kind of mid- to high single improvement. Res was I think, down low singles and non-res low singles to mid-single down. If we kind of look at your new view of the world and in light of kind of what we've seen with some of the activity out there. Is there any way you can kind of help us kind of bridge back these kind of expectations for these end markets relative to kind of what you were looking for?\nHoward Nye: Sure. Happy to, Trey, and that's a great question. So if we think through it, I'll actually work from the bottom up. So we were previously in res, we were saying, look, res was going to be down low single-digits to mid-single-digits. So now as we see it look, we think it's going to be in mid. So we've gone to the lower end of the original guide, if you see it, I mean, relative to res. If we're looking at non-res, we had previously said, look, that's going to be down mid single-digits to high. So we've really taken the same view on that, that we have relative to res. We said that's going to be down high single-digits. Not because we think heavy is not going to be good. I think heavy is going to be increasingly good. These are going to be big jobs. It's going to take a little bit of time. But really, what we've done is \u2013 excuse me, we've looked at the public side of it. We had said we thought public would be up mid single-digits to high single-digits. We actually think that's now going to be modestly down, and it's more of a timing issue than anything else. Because part of what we're assuming is -- let's assume we're going to have a relatively normal weather calendar year this year. And if we go to businesses like the Central division, once we get toward late October, frankly, you're rolling the dice a little bit on whether you're going to have a good business. There won't be frozen weather impacted in November and December. So now we pulled back a bit on infrastructure. And, again, that's not work, Trey, as you know, that's going to go away. It's going to be work that's going to be pushed into 2025. And for a lot of reasons, we're perfectly okay with that. But relative to the guide and relative to the end users, I hope that puts the specificity around it, it will be helpful to you.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, absolutely. That was perfectly helpful. Just one last one, if I could sneak one in. I think you mentioned that the integration of Blue Water and Albert Frei & Sons are complete. And it sounds like they're performing at least as good as your expectations if not better. If you could maybe go a little bit more comments about kind of where you're seeing the outsized benefits or where they're exceeding expectations? And also just on the pipeline. I mean, you just completed two deals this year, one pretty big one. Do you think we should -- what's the pipeline look like? And do you think we should be looking for more kind of tuck-in deals, given that recent M&A activity you've been doing? Or could there still be the potential for some chunky deals out there for you guys?\nHoward Nye: Great questions, Trey. So thank you for all of that. So we'll start with both Blue Water and Al Frei relative to integration. So you're right. I mean from our perspective, those integrations are done. They have been tucked in. They are pure bolt-ons. Our integration process is extraordinarily efficient. And we discussed that before. We typically integrate the back office systems and processes and onboard people literally over the course of a weekend. So our intention is typically to close on a Friday and do a lot of training over the course of the weekend, open Monday and have people going over our scales, getting Martin Marietta tickets and having them in our systems, and that's exactly what happened. So as we think about what's happening with those businesses now, operationally, they're performing really very well, number one. Number two, these are folks who know that they've got a forever home right now. I mean, we're an aggregates-led business. They're delighted to be a part of Martin Marietta. Number three, their safety numbers have been extraordinary. I mentioned in my opening commentary, that from an incident rate perspective, this was the safest quarter that Martin Marietta has ever had. And to be able to say that after we've done the degree of acquisitions that we've done, in my view, is pretty extraordinary. Now if we think about what continued synergy realization is going to look like, several things. Number one, we will continue to invest responsibly in these businesses and fixed plant rolling stock, et cetera, and we think that will continue to make the businesses more efficient. But equally important, the pricing at those locations is actually notably below Martin Marietta corporate average. By that, I mean, let's call it, $4-plus a ton. So if I go back to the commentary that we had on targeted mid-years and the fact that they're coming through the way that we would have expected on the acquisitions, that's going to give us continued near-term upside on those businesses. We think that's likely to persist for a number of years. Operationally, they will continue to get better for a while. So we think there's going to be goodness that's going to be coming to us from Blue Water, from the Albert Frei & Sons, by the way, from the continued acquisitions in California and Arizona for a while yet. Now, that leads into the second part of your question, that is, what does the pipeline look like? And the pipeline continues to look attractive. The pipeline continues to be almost entirely pure aggregates businesses. And they tend to be a bit of a blend of what you said. Some of them have a little bit of chunkiness to them. A lot of them are nice tuck away transactions. We hope we'll have more for you on some of that as the year goes on. As you know, between what's going in and what's gone out this year, we've done well over $4 billion worth of transactions. But if we're sitting at a net leverage of 2 times as of June 30th, as you know, that gives us ample dry powder to continue doing what I think is really a core competency for Martin Marietta, and that is doing M&A and doing it well. M&A is something that's in our DNA, and we're very proud of that. So, Trey, thank you for that second question. I hope that cleared some of those items up too.\nTrey Grooms: Yes, great color. Thanks Ward. Best of luck.\nHoward Nye: Take care.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please ask your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi good morning.\nHoward Nye: Good morning Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I wonder if I can just ask you conceptually right this year, you folks had excellent pricing based on the volumes that we're seeing from everyone across the board, you haven't had to succeed market share to get this level of pricing, we're seeing stubborn inflation across repair and maintenance and elsewhere, how does that impact. How you're thinking about 2025, obviously, we can't count on a volume ramp back up. So, I'm wondering, based on what you're seeing and the receptivity of price increases and inflation. I guess what are the prospects for potential double-digit pricing year again in 2025 based on everything you've seen year-to-date?\nHoward Nye: But obviously, we'll give you more of a definitive guide on that as we go into next year. But Jerry, as I think about the building blocks for what we have, I think infrastructure is going to stay very attractive. I think housing in our markets has more than found bottom. I think that's going to get attractive. I think heavy non-res is and is going to stay attractive. As I indicated in the commentary, I think the lag we've typically seen between non-res on the light side and res is going to be abbreviated, I think that sets us up for a really attractive 2025 and beyond relative to pricing. From my perspective, the pricing that you have seen in Martin Marietta for 30 years as a public company that I think you would look at and say, historically has looked really good. Frankly, you're seeing a step change. And I think the step change is appropriate. But for a number of reasons, and among others, is people now are starting to think about this business on what is replacement cost look like for these hugely valuable reserves. I mean if we look at the reserves we have today, seven-plus years at current extraction rates is a significant body of reserves. At the same time, I don't think that we should be punished for having the discipline and having the vision to make sure that we've got adequate reserves. So, does that tell me? And does that help inform you that we think pricing will continue to be at what I think will be new levels. And probably in that ZIP code of what you're talking about, I think the answer is yes. It probably will. And again, we'll come back with more definitiveness on that in February, but I would not encourage you to think about it materially differently.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I ask you, Jim, in terms of the midpoint of the aggregates gross profit and top line parameters. It looks like on a year-over-year basis, you're guiding to about two points of gross margin expansion back half 2024 versus back half 2023, which is better than in the first half. Is that right? And can you unpack the drivers behind that, if that's the case, how much of that is the mid-years in Tennessee and California, et cetera, that's driving the acceleration in the outlook?\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. No, you're right, those ballpark numbers are correct. The star of the show, as always, has been growing ASP. So that's flowing through in the second half of the year. That's the primary metric that's driving that improved margin, Jerry. Secondary impact is, as I mentioned in prior calls, inflation is abating. It's moderating as the year goes on. So the cost pressures are by and large, coming back down, not to where they were at pre-COVID, of course, but 5% to 6% on baseline cost inflation. So those two things are the main driver.\nJerry Revich: Thank you.\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Jerry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please ask your question.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hi. Good morning.\nHoward Nye: Hi Anthony.\nAnthony Pettinari: Hey, Ward, could you talk a little bit more about maybe state funding environments as you think about next 12 months in fiscal 2025. I think there was some data that suggested general fund spending for the states could be down in fiscal 2025 after a number of years of very strong growth. Obviously, that's not one-to-one to DOT spending. But just wondering, if you could kind of walk through the states and where you're maybe the most excited and seeing some growth versus which could be wider kind of as you think about the next 12 months?\nHoward Nye: No. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it very much. So let's just two march together. So look, if we're looking at Texas DOT lettings, for FY 2024, lettings forecast of $13.7 million. That's up 17% from the year before. But equally, if we're looking to see where they are next year, again, they're looking to be up over that next year. If I'm looking at Colorado, they passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill. And that basically ensures consistent stream of DOT funding beginning in 2023, and that's going to go on for several years. And we expect, even going into 2025 that Colorado DOT is going to have at least $3.7 billion available to spend. And that's going to be a really attractive budget. If we're looking here in the backyard in North Carolina, we expect their budget to increase to $7.6 billion for FY 2025. Again, that's an increase over prior year. And part of what's notable there, keep in mind, North Carolina started looking at different ways to fund their infrastructure a few years ago. And from 2025 thereafter, they're going to be using sales taxes at about 6% to fund infrastructure work here in North Carolina. That's going to make a nice difference. Equally, if we look at Georgia, their 2025 budget of $4.2 billion, that's a 7% increase over where it was in 2024. And this one is interesting to me, even if we look at Florida, Florida's budget, if you look at a top side, looks like it's going down. But that's only because FY 2024 had about $2.1 billion of one-time supplements that were in it. So if we're looking at a base budget in Florida of about $15.1 billion, we're looking at what we think is a base in FY 2025, of about $15.5 billion. The punchline is this, if we go and look at our top 10 states, Texas is up, Florida is up from a base budget perspective, North Carolina is up, Indiana is up, Georgia is up, Colorado is up, Arizona is up, and Texas is up. So really, there are two states that are down. One is Minnesota. It's going from $4.5 billion to about $4 billion. And to put that in some context, Minnesota is going to have a DOT budget next year that's rivaling it back where Georgia is. I don't think that's a bad place for Minnesota to be. And California is going to be modestly down. And I think that's simply in keeping with what we see more broadly in the California budgeting process. But again, if I look at these top 10 states, it looks awfully attractive to me. But equally, when I look at the highway contract awards over a period of time, like if we go back to, let's call it, midyear 2022 on an LTM basis and look at where it is this year, in June on an LTM basis, it's up 25%. And that's the step change that we thought we would see on contract awards. And again, part of SOAR that Jim referenced in his comments, dictated where we wanted to be and one of the places we wanted to be are places that had good, long, durable DOT budgets and had people moving those states so they would have the imperative to continue to invest. And as we look at how those state DOT budgets look today and how they're going to look more importantly to your question tomorrow, we have a lot of confidence about that and have a very attractive outlook as we contemplated. So Anthony, I hope [indiscernible].\nAnthony Pettinari: No, that's extremely helpful. I'll turn it over. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question.\nAngel Castillo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to drill in a little bit more on the kind of 25% of the volume that decline was maybe more related to kind of the price over volume strategy. Could you just talk about is there any sense for kind of what market that may be occurring more and or some of the competitive dynamics that might be driving that versus kind of a greater or increasing kind of discipline toward price over volume?\nHoward Nye: You know what it was interesting because I took that same deep dive that you're trying to do intellectually just to make sure that there wasn't some overriding trend or something that we need to be concerned about or alarmed by, and it wasn't. I mean as you recognize and we do too, markets in our world tend to be an MSA because of the weight to price ratio that I spoke of in the CEO commentary. The material often doesn't travel very far. And what we see on occasion is somebody can be aggressive. Somebody can be long on any given product. There can be just a whole host of things that can drive different degrees of behavior in different markets. So we're not seeing anything that's overwhelming in any one market that causes us any concern. Obviously, we've stated a preference for value over volume. We believe in that. We see it in the numbers. We believe that it's proving its efficacy and what we're seeing in the financial results. At the same time, we're always going to be thoughtful around are we pushing too hard on occasion and are we losing too much. And so it's a process we do go through. It's a dialogue that we do have here in this office, but more importantly, have it with our division presidents and VP GMs. So there's no one area that if I were you, I would look at and have any concern about, obviously, I don't want to talk about specific markets per se. It was really more of a weather event than anything else, degrees of softening and then here or there on pricing. But Angel, that's the best way that I can guide you to think about it right now.\nAngel Castillo: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on the cement business. You talked about that returning to kind of being close to full sold out in the quarter or, I guess, [indiscernible] the third quarter. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color or remind us how we should kind of be thinking about the flow through of the expansion in terms of ramp-up of volumes, and how you kind of see the profitability of that business has to be kind of normalized from these weather impacts?\nHoward Nye: Sure. So, I'll do a couple of things. One, I'll ask Jim to speak to the capital project that we have underway, and he can give you a bit more on that and the 450,000 tons that will be added through that, because we'll be thoughtful around the way that we do it. But obviously, if we're just looking at what happened relative to the weather in DFW, that was the driver pure and simply. I mean that took organic shipments down about 18%. But again, pricing was up 9.5%. And part of what we saw in that business is we actually saw gross margins expand in that business. And that's one reason that we speak to what we've long called strategic cement. It's where we're an aggregates leader, where the market is naturally vertically integrated, where we have a downstream business, and we do in Dallas, that takes about 30% of what we're doing there. And its ability to be interdicted by waterborne imports is really quite minimal. And so if we look at what strategic cement for us is, it's Midlothian. If we look at how the pricing behaved, it behaved well. despite the fact that organic shipments were down, we still expanded gross margins, which is why we want to invest capital in that market. And for that, let me turn to Jim, and he can give you a sense of where we are in that process and how we think about volume.\nJim Nickolas: Yes. So that project, the finish mill 7, as we call it, will be completed this quarter. As you know, it's 450,000 tons per year of annual production capacity. So give or take, 110-ish thousand ton per quarter. We won't hit the market with that full speed on day one. We'll be responsible about feathering in those volumes to ensure we don't disrupt the commercial strategy we've been following in that marketplace. So more to come on when that comes out, but that will be helpful to us, a, in terms of volume, but also more importantly, operational flexibility, wait time for customers, storage facilities, our ability to react to different events is enhanced as a result of this project. So we're looking for this to improve margins going forward and of course, volumes as those become available to us.\nHoward Nye: Angel, the last part of your question was what do we see happening in volumes here as the quarter ended? And I think we indicated as weather got better in Dallas Fort Worth, we were back to near sold-out conditions at Midlothian. So, I think that puts a bow around it.\nAngel Castillo: Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nHoward Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nZack Pacheco: Good morning. It's actually Zack Pacheco on for Garik this morning. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate you guys walking through the outlook on state funding moving forward, a couple of questions to go, maybe just to dive into that real quickly. We've been hearing other siding inflation kind of eating into those IIJA base dollars, therefore, causing some delays. Just curious if you guys are seeing that at all, or are the base dollars truly just flowing through nicely? Thanks.\nHoward Nye: I think we'd be naive to assume the degrees of inflation haven't eaten into that. And so when we went back over time, I've said before, whatever the volume that people thought would come out of IIJA, the year it was signed in the law. Have you seen some of that being eroded by inflation? Yes, I think so. But at the end of the day, very selfishly from a Martin Marietta perspective, would we trade the volume that we see for the pricing that we're seeing? The answer is yes. I think part of what's so important to keep in mind too is I don't think IIJA is a one-hit wonder. In other words, I think we simply changed the floor in the way that the United States Congress and the government will continue to invest in infrastructure because keep in mind, we went 1.5 decades with woefully under-funded infrastructure. So I think in many respects, yes, some degree of volume has been taken out simply because of inflation. At the same time, I believe when we see a reauthorization of this act, we're likely to see something at/or above where this is. And again, it would provide a nice extended period of time for the United States to invest in this much-needed infrastructure. At the same time, it will allow us to make sure that we're getting the appropriate return for our very valuable materials that are in the ground and that we work hard to turn into a spec product. So that's the way that we think about it. There's nothing per se new in that, but I think it's important to be able to articulate that to the investing public, because I think from our perspective, it works.\nZack Pacheco: No, that makes sense. Thanks.\nHoward Nye: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of Truist. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nKeith Hughes: Thank you. Questions back in cement. To your point, tremendous pricing, the best pricing increase I've seen during this earnings season from cement. Now the Midlothian is back to sold out, is there going to be further increases this calendar year? Or is that something we'll have to contemplate for next year?\nHoward Nye: No. Look, we've certainly told the market that we are looking to have another dialogue in September. Obviously, it's not yet September. So we'll have to see how that goes, Keith. But again, there are a lot of different cement markets across the United States. And Dallas is a really good cement market. And, obviously, Dallas had a strange market in Q2 simply because it was wet. But when Martin Marietta was buying TXI back in 2014 and 2015, I remember very clearly what I said to our Board of Directors at the time, and that was -- I felt like Dallas-Fort Worth might well be the single most attractive heavy side building materials market in the United States for the next 25 years. It has not disappointed. So have we told our customers that we're going to have a dialogue in September? Yes. Am I ready to tell you what that's going to look like? The answer is no. But in any event, to your point, as I've watched public data come out, I concur with your conclusion, I haven't seen a market that has reacted more attractively than DFW has on pricing on a percentage basis.\nKeith Hughes: Okay. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please ask your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: Good morning guys. Share repurchases. That was a really heavy pace in the first half of the year. Curious how we should read that and what the outlook is?\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. Well, simply, there's a couple of things that go into that. One is we are well-below our target leverage ratio. And we had entered the year with the quarter with over $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet. So that was part of it. But, of course, we thought the stock price was at an attractive level as well. We thought it was under undervalued. So that's really -- it's as simple as that. We're pretty opportunistic about our stock buyback, Try to avoid a lazy balance sheet at the same time, and those things just coalesce this quarter.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks, Jim.\nJim Nickolas: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Please ask your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is actually Collin [ph] on for Phil. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the aggregate volume guide. What is baked into the aggregate 1% to 4% decline from an organic perspective? And how are you thinking about those organic trends in the back half of the year here, just given the wet start to the third quarter and maybe some of the softer trends that you're seeing in the warehouse office and resi markets that you called out.\nHoward Nye: Yeah. Thanks, Collin. Thanks for the question. We try at this point now that those operations are really fully integrated. I wanted to break some out for the quarter because we were going through the integration process, but now that they're fully integrated, we just think about it candidly at this point is all organic going forward. I mean, clearly, I gave some, I thought, helpful color relative to end users and what we thought the shifts are going to be relative to up, down, sideways, et cetera. But again, if we're looking at the second half of the year on infrastructure, we think it's going to be a busy second half of the year. At the same time, the biggest things that we're trying to get our heads around is what we're navigating right now and what will be the fallout from, as I said, what, July and what has so far been a wet August with the hurricane making its way literally from somewhere between Myrtle Beach and Charleston right now, eventually up through the Greensboro High Point area. So those are more of the swing factors in the near term and in the longer term, this year, to the extent there can be longer term this year, it's really going to be more driven by when winter sets in and what the effects of that may be in certain markets. So I can remember years that we were doing asphalt and paving in Colorado in December. That doesn't happen very often, but it does happen. And those will be your swing factors really as we think about volumes but more granularly as we think about infrastructure.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And just one follow-up question. I guess if we see some more accommodating monetary policy here in the back -- later this year, how quickly do you start -- do you think that starts to show up in your shipments?\nHoward Nye: I think it starts to show up reasonably early in 2025 because I do think in portions of private, particularly in homebuilding, et cetera, you've got the pent-up demand. And it's interesting as we have people looking to move to Raleigh, one of the issues that they chronically run into. And by the way, I'm using Raleigh as an example, but we could go across our footprint and say the same thing. The inventories is really very low. And frankly, from our perspective, that's a pretty high-class problem, Collin. Is it tough for people moving to the area because they can't find a home that they want? Yes. Does it mean, however, that once you have that more accommodating policy that you're going to see homebuilders moving, we think, with alacrity to fill what's a needed hole right now. We think that's the case. And that tends to be, particularly if they've made the investment in land, which in many instances they have, that they can move relatively quickly and keep in mind a portion of what we're going to capture as residential will be those streets. It will be that curb and gutter. It will be the sidewalks. It will be the utilities until those subdivisions are turned over to the local municipality for maintenance. So what we see on the resi side, I think so, does that mean that you're going to see light non-res come behind it in that more abbreviated period, I think so. And all that underlies what we think will be a continuing attractive infrastructure setting. So again, I hope that's helpful.\nUnidentified Analyst: It is. Thank you for the color.\nHoward Nye: You bet, Colline.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please ask your question.\nJoe Nolan: Hey. Good morning. This is Joe Nolan on for David. You touched on COGS briefly, but I was just hoping you could provide an updated cost outlook for the year and discuss some of the moving parts within that. You also mentioned your focus on controlling costs. I guess I was just wondering, what are some of the areas that you can focus on with cost-cutting measures in a softer market?\nHoward Nye: So happy to, Jim, you want to ahead and take the first and I'll come back on where we're focused?\nJim Nickolas: Yeah. So the full year guide on COGS per ton it's -- well, second half rather to be more precise is up 7% second half of this year versus second half last year. It's reflective of, again, general inflation slowly coming down. There's a little bit of under-absorption in that as well as the volumes come down versus their old -- our old view. Then the repairs and maintenance costs have remained elevated. We've seen some improvement as we -- as volumes have come down on contract services. The outsourced services have been reduced, lower over time. And of course, we do have a bit of diesel tailwind built in, so that's helpful too.\nHoward Nye: Well, I think Jim really hit very, very nicely, a, what the percentages look like; b, what the emphasis is going to be. Obviously, we're going to be focused on maintenance and repairs because we've seen those up disproportionately. But we're also seeing general inflation come down. We are seeing some nice tailwinds coming from portions of energy. It's been a bit of a bifurcated situation, though, because we've seen diesel clearly better. We've seen electric modestly up. But again, managing our hours managing our over time, keeping our people safe will be areas that we will have a unique focus as we always do in the second half of the year. But I think you will see a better trend on repairs in particular.\nJoe Nolan: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nHoward Nye: You bet. Good to talk to you, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James. Please ask your question.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning. You talked a little bit about this earlier. But if I'm not mistaken, in conjunction with Blue Water, there was a notice of a July 15 midyear. I believe you had already communicated midyear's out West early in the year. So I'm just curious though, when you look at the portfolio, just how close are prices how West's recently acquired operations to being harmonized to your heritage markets? Because I assume your heritage markets are also price increasing. So do you feel like there's still some catch-up work there? And why wouldn't this be a sizable tailwind to pricing over the next few years just as you harmonize that whole portfolio?\nHoward Nye: So Tyler, thank you for the question. So I would say two things. One, we are getting closer. We are getting ever closer to harmony in the Western U.S. So pretty soon, you can start humming that music. I think that's going to be there. But here's the other thought that I would have for you I'm not sure we're looking for harmony in the West. I think the West ought to be a price leader because as we look at the cost of doing business in California as we look at barriers to entry in California, just a host of things. The West Coast businesses should never, in my view, have been businesses priced below a Martin Marietta heritage number. And I think there should be a premium associated with businesses in that geography, because you've got at times some premium costs associated with that geography. Now, to the rest of your question, should there be recovery in places like Tennessee and elsewhere as we continue to go through the synergy realization process of the Blue Water operations. The answer is yes, there should be. And as I indicated, I think in some of my earlier commentary, there's over $4 a ton delta right now between the average in those locations and heritage Martin Marietta. So to your point, should there be an extended period of goodness in that. The answer is yes because, obviously, the heritage footprint or price profile will continue to go up as we continue to move up at the Blue Water operations as well and get those closer to that harmony point that we spoke of before. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me as I look at our portfolio that North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee would or should look materially different. And that's where we're endeavoring to take the business.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Excellent. Okay. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: Thank you, Tyler.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nMichael Dudas: Good morning, gentlemen.\nHoward Nye: Good morning.\nMichael Dudas: Did notice in the presentation that the Magnesia outlook is up for 2024 relative to the expectations. So maybe spend a little bit on a minute on that business? And is there any reads or indications on general economic or business activity that can be helpful to thinking about how that business flows over the next several quarters?\nHoward Nye: Happy to. And it's really a tale of two different businesses there. So if we're looking just at revenues, as Jim said in his comments, they were relatively flat. Now as we look at that, chemicals up around 7%, lime though, up 24%. And what we're seeing is pricing gains are more than offsetting lower chemical shipments. So chemical markets around the world. And keep in mind, this is not just a regional business. This is a business that we cover the US and we have double-digit international business there as well. So we obviously saw volumes down, we saw pricing up. So you're seeing a lot of the same dynamics in the Magnesia Specialties business that we're seeing overall in the aggregates business as well. Part of what I'm pleased with is steel utilization levels are remaining just above the 70% historical average, that's not a terribly high number. And what our team has been able to do there is several fold. One, control costs really well. Number two, they're going about their commercial strategy in a fundamental fundamentally different way. That's been a business that historically has had longer-term contracts, and they've been in a position revisit those contracts, reset them and make sure that, again, same circumstances aggregates. We've got long-lived reserves at our facility in Woodville, Ohio. We have long-lived brine reserves in Manistee, Michigan. At the same time, we need to be getting good value for those. And Chris Sanborski and his team have managed both sides of that business, controlling costs well and controlling pricing really well. And the EBITDA numbers that we're seeing in that business based on the volume in that business. Frankly, looks fundamentally different today than it would have two or three years ago under the same economic circumstances. So I'm very pleased with that business. The other thing that I'll say, too, it wasn't part of your question, but I think it underscores the efficiency of the business. Their safety numbers have also gotten notably better. And you just see that business going in a direction that we're very pleased with. And what's probably one of the tougher economies that any sector of our business is dealing with. And they're likely to come in with a record EBITDA year this year. And that's the type of performance in this setting that makes us really excited about what Martin Marietta is going to look like in 2025, 2026, 2027, et cetera.\nMichael Dudas: Excellent. Appreciate that work. Thank you.\nHoward Nye: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nTimna Tanners: Hi. Good morning. One remaining one from us, if I could.\nHoward Nye: Good morning, Timna.\nTimna Tanners: Good morning. I actually just -- I wanted to touch on the comments you had earlier about interest rates, and I want to ask something similar, but about the election because we are hearing that there's some pause in activity around the election. And so curious about that, but also if you could dive into maybe any risk to some of the IRA-related projects, especially as they relate to EV demand and given the potential outcome of the election? Thanks.\nHoward Nye: So Timna, thank you so much. What we're not seeing -- I don't think we're seeing a real slowdown in public relative to the election. So I think that just chugs along. I think that can have an effect on private. And I think that's probably some of what we've seen in the first half of this year. So I think that's probably just more of the same. Relative to public and what that could look like on IIJA reauthorization or the Inflation Reduction Act or otherwise. Yes, I would say several things. One, I think we're relatively agnostic. And here's why, Timna. Look, I think if you have a democratic administration that's in power this next time. My guess is IIJA looks pretty similar on a reauthorization basis and then you continue to see things like the Inflation Reduction Act. I think if you have a Republican administration, honestly, you probably have a more amped up infrastructure law and probably less IRA. And again, from our perspective, they're probably almost awash, and again, if we're looking at where the big investments are going to be made in highways, bridges, roads and streets, it's going to follow where people are. It's going to be driven by what's happening with DOT budgets, and it's going to be happening driven by what happens at the ballot box, where most of these places that are seeing big population trends continue to pass initiatives at well over 80% rates of passage, and we think that's going to endure. Frankly, if we've looked at the last several elections and you look at what's passed, almost half of it tends to be in Texas. And again, it goes back to building that marketplace that we have in Dallas Fort Worth and San Antonio and in Houston. And again, relative to what we see going on in energy and otherwise, I think that can move around a little bit depending on whether we have regime change. But if you build your businesses the way that we have on major commerce corridors, that's where the activity is going to be, whether it's factories, whether it's industrial, whether it's energy or otherwise. And that's why the positions we have along the I-85 corridor, the I-95 corridor, the I-25 corridor, the I-35 corridor and the I-5 corridor are so important to us. And keep in mind, Timna, we're the largest shipper of crushed stone on the railroads for a reason. We're the largest shipper of stone on BNUP. Number one on CSX, number two on Norfolk Southern and now number one on the Canadians after they bought the Kansas City Southern. And to the extent that this industrial buildout continues on either commerce by truck or commerce by rail, we're going to be well suited by that. And I think that's why from an election perspective, we're relatively agnostic and I think we're going to be good either way, and we love that durability.\nTimna Tanners: Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: We do not have any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye.\nHoward Nye: Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta has built a durable and resilient business poised to continue outperforming through dynamic macroeconomic cycles. Our compelling underlying fundamentals, dedicated teams, well-defined strategic plan, carefully curated coast-to-coast footprint in the country's fastest-growing markets and unparalleled attractive growth opportunities reinforce our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2024 results with your fall. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Howard Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacklyn, and thank you all for joining this teleconference. As indicated in today's earnings release, several dynamics impacted our second quarter financial results and particularly product shipments. The most notable driver was an historic 119% increase in precipitation in Dallas-Fort Worth our company's single largest and most profitable metropolitan marketplace as well as disproportionate rain and flooding in parts of the Midwest. Secondarily, the lag effect of restrictive monetary policy is pressuring interest rate-sensitive private construction demand more than previously anticipated. And while our value over volume philosophy also contributed modestly to the shipment decline, the benefits of our commercial strategy are clearly evidenced by the second quarter strong unit profitability growth and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Moving forward, our team remains focused on what we can control, and view the demand impacts from weather and high interest rates is temporary. That said, we expect slower shipment trends to persist in the year's second half. As a result, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.2 billion at the midpoint. While second quarter shipments were below our initial expectations, there were notable highlights worthy of mention as foundational for Martin Marietta's long-term success. Starting first with Safety, I'm proud to report that we concluded the first half of 2024 with the best Safety incidents rates in our company's history, inclusive of our newly acquired businesses. Operationally, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin and achieved record second quarter organic and total aggregates gross profit despite significant weather headwinds. Importantly, aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, with aggregates average selling price increasing 11.6% or 12% on an organic mix-adjusted basis. We expect this commercial momentum and related margin expansion to continue following realization of our previously announced July pricing actions. These accomplishments underscore the resiliency of our aggregates-led business reinforced by our teams' fidelity to maintaining a safe workplace and our unrelenting commitment to both commercial and operational excellence. From a portfolio optimization standpoint, on April 5, we completed the acquisition of 20 aggregates operations from Blue Water Industries, and in so doing, efficiently redeploy the cash proceeds from the South Texas cement and concrete divestiture. These high-quality pure-play aggregates operations from Blue Water strategically complement our existing footprint in the Southeastern United States and position us in attractive new markets including Tennessee and South Florida for future growth. I'm pleased to report that the integration of both the Blue Water and Albert Frei & Sons acquisitions is complete. The combined financial performance has exceeded management's initial expectations, and the synergy realization will be increasingly compelling. Moving forward, the M&A pipeline remains active and largely focused on pure-play aggregates businesses and attractive or identified geographies. Shifting now to end market trends, our single most aggregates-intensive end use is infrastructure, which continues to benefit from increased funding and investment levels, while highway and street spending is expected to remain well above historic levels, leading indicators are predictably starting to lap more robust comparable periods. This is evidenced in the value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, which declined modestly below 2023 levels to $114 billion. Funding certainty at the federal level through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA, together with record state DOT budgets and constituent actions support a healthy pricing environment for construction materials in 2025 and beyond. With the 2024 election process well underway, it's important to note rebuilding and enhancing our nation's infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities remain bipartisan, national strategic priorities, as revealed by the high passage rates on local infrastructure ballot initiatives and three key legislative actions, the IIJA, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. Moving now to heavy non-residential construction, reshoring activity for large manufacturing and energy projects continues to drive product demand. Aside from warehouse construction, which is contracting from its post-COVID peak, starts on a square footage basis remained well above what were healthy in 2019 levels. While not wholly offsetting, construction spending for domestic manufacturing continues to trend positively with the June 2024 seasonally adjusted annual rate of spending at $236 billion, a 19% increase from the June 2023 value of $198 billion. Importantly, the breadth of reshoring projects is expanding from automotive, batteries and semiconductors to pharmaceuticals. For example, Novo Nordisk is investing $4 billion to build a 1.4 million square foot manufacturing facility near Raleigh, North Carolina, which we're well positioned to supply from our nearby quarries. In addition, while artificial intelligence is in its early stages, Martin Marietta is geographically well positioned to capitalize on the related data center and infrastructure build-out led by big tech, including Amazon, whose announced plans to invest more than $100 billion over the next decade on data centers alone. Relative to light non-residential and residential activity, restrictive monetary policy continues to impact these interest rate sensitive end markets. The lock-in effect of high mortgage rates and low inventory are only serving to exacerbate the well-chronicled housing affordability and availability issues in many of our company's key metropolitan areas. That said, recent inflation and employment data should provide the foundation for accommodative Federal Reserve policy actions later this year and into 2025. I encourage you to read more on this as discussed in the CEO commentary and market perspective, released earlier today. Beyond 2024, we expect the generational highway and street investments as the nascent reshoring and artificial intelligence infrastructure build-out are very much expected to provide an extended multiyear construction cycle in these aggregates intensive end markets. Equally, when the affordability headwinds recede, we fully expect an accelerated housing construction recovery, specifically in single family, which will be required to address the structural deficit of homes in many of Martin Marietta's key markets. Importantly, as history informs us, growth in single-family construction bodes well for light non-residential activity, which typically follows with a lag, but in this instance, a lag, which we believe will be more abbreviated than previous cycles. I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter financial results. Jim? Thanks, Jim. In 2024, Martin Marietta is proudly celebrating our 30th year as a publicly-traded company. Our three decades of success has been the result of an unwavering commitment to safety and the disciplined execution of our proven strategy. As we plan for the next 30 years, we're confident Martin Marietta is well positioned to continue leading our industry's evolution while at the same time, navigating through inevitable macroeconomic cycles and driving sustainable, attractive growth. We remain committed to building and maintaining the safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led business and look forward to delivering superior shareholder value for our stakeholders for years and decades to come. If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Good morning, Kathryn, thank you for the question. So look, weather was a big deal in Q2, there's no doubt about it. So I said in the prepared remarks that it was 119% weather in DFW this year than it was last year. And the fact is if you look at what happened in North Texas all by itself, but then you couple that with what happened in the Central division. And what I suppose is most people don't think about the Central division as being impactful to us as it is. Really, if we're looking at Dallas itself and the Central division together, those two areas of business typically represent nearly 40% of our Q2 shipments. So if we're looking at significant rain in Dallas and significant rain and flooding in the Midwest, that was really a serious body blow to the business. And what I like about that is it took that blow and came in with record aggregates profitability, record unit profitability and did all of that taking on the $20 million of inventory fair markup that we've totally absorbed in Q2. So seeing what happened in Dallas was important, understanding what happened in the Midwest was important. But I was also taken with the resiliency of our cement business in North Texas. Again, we've long defined what equals strategic cement for us. And clearly, what we have in that market is just that. I mean, we saw organic shipment volumes down about 18%, and again, that was all driven by rain, but pricing up nearly 10% and with very, very good performance. And as Jim indicated in his comments, we were seeing that marketplace turn to near sold-out levels as soon as the rain abated. So those were issues, I think, 50% at least of what we saw in the quarter was attributable to rain. Do I think a portion of it was attributable to the economy? Yes, probably 25% of it. So what am I seeing there? It's really what we indicated private construction because of what's happening with interest rates are seeing degrees of modest pullback. But the important thing to remember there, Kathryn, is we don't see markets that are overbuilt today in Martin Marietta marketplaces. So we feel like that's going to be fleeting. But equally, value over volume cost us some tonnage during the quarter. But the fact is we're perfectly okay with that. Again, we monitor that. We're going to be thoughtful around it. But again, we're seeing continued expanded adjusted EBITDA margins in what we're doing. We feel like the breakdown we've had between weather at 50%, market at 25% and value over volume at about 25% makes sense. But the other part of your question went to the cadence of how we think about the quarters. Let me turn that over to Jim to talk you through that a bit because that is going to change modestly. Thank you, Kathryn. Look, if we're looking at customer backlogs, they're up sequentially so they continue to build. Number one, I think that's important. Number two, if we're looking at the nature of the projects, look, infrastructure is going to be a good end use for several years, and we see that continuing. If we're looking at non-res, we're seeing degrees of shifts there. And by the way, that's not a surprise to us. So are we seeing more factories? The answer is yes. Are we seeing good pricing that goes with that? The answer is yes. Are we seeing good steady work and growing work, frankly, relative to energy? The answer is yes. Are we seeing growing work relative to data centers for all the reasons that I indicated in the prepared remarks, and in the commentary that we published today, that continues to grow. Obviously, warehousing is not. That's not a surprise to anyone. And what we're seeing is you almost have 2 lanes of traveling. You have data centers in one lane and they're going in a positive direction, and warehousing is going in the other, and you're seeing those percentages almost past each other on a precise precision or percentage basis today. So that's the type of work that we're seeing. The other thing that we're beginning to see, and this is more in Georgia. It's in North Carolina. It's in South Carolina. We're seeing green shoots and degrees of single-family housing right now. And again, that's not a big surprise simply because of the population dynamics. And again, relative to housing, we're such a small portion of the overall housing that traditionally in single-family housing back to the essence of your question, that tends to be very attractive priced materials, Kathryn. So I hope that's helpful. Thank you. You bet. Happy to. And Stanley, thank you for your comments. We appreciate it. I'm with you. I think that was actually a very good performance, given what our team managed through. So several things. Let's start with pricing. So as you've seen, we've reaffirmed our pricing guide of 11% to 13% up, and that includes the previously announced midyears for California for the Frei business, for Blue Water locations as well as the targeted product and market-specific mid-years in other geographies. And by the way, that's pretty typical for us. The one thing that I think is going to be important this year relative to the midyears, so much volume that had already been bid at the January 1 pricing is still yet to go because of the deferral that we've seen. So typically, in a year, I've always told you historically. You could probably see about 1/4 of the midyears really show up in any given year in which they're put in. I think the midyears are going to be notably more impactful in '25. In other words, when we come back to you in January and talk about our guide for next year, I think you're going to see more mid-years affecting that this year than not. So that's how we're thinking about the ASP in the guide. Relative to volumes, clearly, that reflects an impacted first half results and early \u2013 other \u2013 here in the second half of the year. July was wet and we're sitting here today as tropical storm Debbie is going through the Carolinas. So we're living that. And so we're trying to take our experience with those events and really build that into the volume guide for the second half of the year. So we feel confident that we've hit that with as much clarity as we can given the circumstances. Look, relative to what will be expected as lower shipment levels. So our teams are going to be focused, as you would imagine, is too. Very much on cost control and making sure we're flexing our costs with demand. So we're very focused on that. The other thing that I think you'll see is given the inventory builds that we had with wet weather, where we're producing but not selling, there's going to be a little bit of inventory drawdown, and that's going to impact us a bit in half two. And it can provide a modest headwind to EBITDA. But again, we've taken that into account in what we put out there for you. One thing to keep in mind, too, is we're looking at the EBITDA guide, and I think this is something that's easy to forget. We grew EBITDA in 2023 by 33%. And I mean that's a really big number. And it gives you a difficult year compare. But at the same time, we're seeing EBITDA margin grow. And even at the guide, we're looking at a two-year CAGR of high teens, getting close to 17%, getting close to 20%. So again, numbers that we're very proud of, numbers that we feel good about as we're going into the second half of the year. And then at a foundation, particularly relative to pricing that we think puts us in a very attractive place as we start increasingly thinking about 2025, Stanley. Thanks, Stanley. Thank you, Trey, very much. Sure. Happy to, Trey, and that's a great question. So if we think through it, I'll actually work from the bottom up. So we were previously in res, we were saying, look, res was going to be down low single-digits to mid-single-digits. So now as we see it look, we think it's going to be in mid. So we've gone to the lower end of the original guide, if you see it, I mean, relative to res. If we're looking at non-res, we had previously said, look, that's going to be down mid single-digits to high. So we've really taken the same view on that, that we have relative to res. We said that's going to be down high single-digits. Not because we think heavy is not going to be good. I think heavy is going to be increasingly good. These are going to be big jobs. It's going to take a little bit of time. But really, what we've done is \u2013 excuse me, we've looked at the public side of it. We had said we thought public would be up mid single-digits to high single-digits. We actually think that's now going to be modestly down, and it's more of a timing issue than anything else. Because part of what we're assuming is -- let's assume we're going to have a relatively normal weather calendar year this year. And if we go to businesses like the Central division, once we get toward late October, frankly, you're rolling the dice a little bit on whether you're going to have a good business. There won't be frozen weather impacted in November and December. So now we pulled back a bit on infrastructure. And, again, that's not work, Trey, as you know, that's going to go away. It's going to be work that's going to be pushed into 2025. And for a lot of reasons, we're perfectly okay with that. But relative to the guide and relative to the end users, I hope that puts the specificity around it, it will be helpful to you. Great questions, Trey. So thank you for all of that. So we'll start with both Blue Water and Al Frei relative to integration. So you're right. I mean from our perspective, those integrations are done. They have been tucked in. They are pure bolt-ons. Our integration process is extraordinarily efficient. And we discussed that before. We typically integrate the back office systems and processes and onboard people literally over the course of a weekend. So our intention is typically to close on a Friday and do a lot of training over the course of the weekend, open Monday and have people going over our scales, getting Martin Marietta tickets and having them in our systems, and that's exactly what happened. So as we think about what's happening with those businesses now, operationally, they're performing really very well, number one. Number two, these are folks who know that they've got a forever home right now. I mean, we're an aggregates-led business. They're delighted to be a part of Martin Marietta. Number three, their safety numbers have been extraordinary. I mentioned in my opening commentary, that from an incident rate perspective, this was the safest quarter that Martin Marietta has ever had. And to be able to say that after we've done the degree of acquisitions that we've done, in my view, is pretty extraordinary. Now if we think about what continued synergy realization is going to look like, several things. Number one, we will continue to invest responsibly in these businesses and fixed plant rolling stock, et cetera, and we think that will continue to make the businesses more efficient. But equally important, the pricing at those locations is actually notably below Martin Marietta corporate average. By that, I mean, let's call it, $4-plus a ton. So if I go back to the commentary that we had on targeted mid-years and the fact that they're coming through the way that we would have expected on the acquisitions, that's going to give us continued near-term upside on those businesses. We think that's likely to persist for a number of years. Operationally, they will continue to get better for a while. So we think there's going to be goodness that's going to be coming to us from Blue Water, from the Albert Frei & Sons, by the way, from the continued acquisitions in California and Arizona for a while yet. Now, that leads into the second part of your question, that is, what does the pipeline look like? And the pipeline continues to look attractive. The pipeline continues to be almost entirely pure aggregates businesses. And they tend to be a bit of a blend of what you said. Some of them have a little bit of chunkiness to them. A lot of them are nice tuck away transactions. We hope we'll have more for you on some of that as the year goes on. As you know, between what's going in and what's gone out this year, we've done well over $4 billion worth of transactions. But if we're sitting at a net leverage of 2 times as of June 30th, as you know, that gives us ample dry powder to continue doing what I think is really a core competency for Martin Marietta, and that is doing M&A and doing it well. M&A is something that's in our DNA, and we're very proud of that. So, Trey, thank you for that second question. I hope that cleared some of those items up too. Take care. Good morning Jerry. But obviously, we'll give you more of a definitive guide on that as we go into next year. But Jerry, as I think about the building blocks for what we have, I think infrastructure is going to stay very attractive. I think housing in our markets has more than found bottom. I think that's going to get attractive. I think heavy non-res is and is going to stay attractive. As I indicated in the commentary, I think the lag we've typically seen between non-res on the light side and res is going to be abbreviated, I think that sets us up for a really attractive 2025 and beyond relative to pricing. From my perspective, the pricing that you have seen in Martin Marietta for 30 years as a public company that I think you would look at and say, historically has looked really good. Frankly, you're seeing a step change. And I think the step change is appropriate. But for a number of reasons, and among others, is people now are starting to think about this business on what is replacement cost look like for these hugely valuable reserves. I mean if we look at the reserves we have today, seven-plus years at current extraction rates is a significant body of reserves. At the same time, I don't think that we should be punished for having the discipline and having the vision to make sure that we've got adequate reserves. So, does that tell me? And does that help inform you that we think pricing will continue to be at what I think will be new levels. And probably in that ZIP code of what you're talking about, I think the answer is yes. It probably will. And again, we'll come back with more definitiveness on that in February, but I would not encourage you to think about it materially differently. Hi Anthony. No. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it very much. So let's just two march together. So look, if we're looking at Texas DOT lettings, for FY 2024, lettings forecast of $13.7 million. That's up 17% from the year before. But equally, if we're looking to see where they are next year, again, they're looking to be up over that next year. If I'm looking at Colorado, they passed a $5.3 billion 10-year infrastructure bill. And that basically ensures consistent stream of DOT funding beginning in 2023, and that's going to go on for several years. And we expect, even going into 2025 that Colorado DOT is going to have at least $3.7 billion available to spend. And that's going to be a really attractive budget. If we're looking here in the backyard in North Carolina, we expect their budget to increase to $7.6 billion for FY 2025. Again, that's an increase over prior year. And part of what's notable there, keep in mind, North Carolina started looking at different ways to fund their infrastructure a few years ago. And from 2025 thereafter, they're going to be using sales taxes at about 6% to fund infrastructure work here in North Carolina. That's going to make a nice difference. Equally, if we look at Georgia, their 2025 budget of $4.2 billion, that's a 7% increase over where it was in 2024. And this one is interesting to me, even if we look at Florida, Florida's budget, if you look at a top side, looks like it's going down. But that's only because FY 2024 had about $2.1 billion of one-time supplements that were in it. So if we're looking at a base budget in Florida of about $15.1 billion, we're looking at what we think is a base in FY 2025, of about $15.5 billion. The punchline is this, if we go and look at our top 10 states, Texas is up, Florida is up from a base budget perspective, North Carolina is up, Indiana is up, Georgia is up, Colorado is up, Arizona is up, and Texas is up. So really, there are two states that are down. One is Minnesota. It's going from $4.5 billion to about $4 billion. And to put that in some context, Minnesota is going to have a DOT budget next year that's rivaling it back where Georgia is. I don't think that's a bad place for Minnesota to be. And California is going to be modestly down. And I think that's simply in keeping with what we see more broadly in the California budgeting process. But again, if I look at these top 10 states, it looks awfully attractive to me. But equally, when I look at the highway contract awards over a period of time, like if we go back to, let's call it, midyear 2022 on an LTM basis and look at where it is this year, in June on an LTM basis, it's up 25%. And that's the step change that we thought we would see on contract awards. And again, part of SOAR that Jim referenced in his comments, dictated where we wanted to be and one of the places we wanted to be are places that had good, long, durable DOT budgets and had people moving those states so they would have the imperative to continue to invest. And as we look at how those state DOT budgets look today and how they're going to look more importantly to your question tomorrow, we have a lot of confidence about that and have a very attractive outlook as we contemplated. So Anthony, I hope [indiscernible]. Thank you. You know what it was interesting because I took that same deep dive that you're trying to do intellectually just to make sure that there wasn't some overriding trend or something that we need to be concerned about or alarmed by, and it wasn't. I mean as you recognize and we do too, markets in our world tend to be an MSA because of the weight to price ratio that I spoke of in the CEO commentary. The material often doesn't travel very far. And what we see on occasion is somebody can be aggressive. Somebody can be long on any given product. There can be just a whole host of things that can drive different degrees of behavior in different markets. So we're not seeing anything that's overwhelming in any one market that causes us any concern. Obviously, we've stated a preference for value over volume. We believe in that. We see it in the numbers. We believe that it's proving its efficacy and what we're seeing in the financial results. At the same time, we're always going to be thoughtful around are we pushing too hard on occasion and are we losing too much. And so it's a process we do go through. It's a dialogue that we do have here in this office, but more importantly, have it with our division presidents and VP GMs. So there's no one area that if I were you, I would look at and have any concern about, obviously, I don't want to talk about specific markets per se. It was really more of a weather event than anything else, degrees of softening and then here or there on pricing. But Angel, that's the best way that I can guide you to think about it right now. Sure. So, I'll do a couple of things. One, I'll ask Jim to speak to the capital project that we have underway, and he can give you a bit more on that and the 450,000 tons that will be added through that, because we'll be thoughtful around the way that we do it. But obviously, if we're just looking at what happened relative to the weather in DFW, that was the driver pure and simply. I mean that took organic shipments down about 18%. But again, pricing was up 9.5%. And part of what we saw in that business is we actually saw gross margins expand in that business. And that's one reason that we speak to what we've long called strategic cement. It's where we're an aggregates leader, where the market is naturally vertically integrated, where we have a downstream business, and we do in Dallas, that takes about 30% of what we're doing there. And its ability to be interdicted by waterborne imports is really quite minimal. And so if we look at what strategic cement for us is, it's Midlothian. If we look at how the pricing behaved, it behaved well. despite the fact that organic shipments were down, we still expanded gross margins, which is why we want to invest capital in that market. And for that, let me turn to Jim, and he can give you a sense of where we are in that process and how we think about volume. Angel, the last part of your question was what do we see happening in volumes here as the quarter ended? And I think we indicated as weather got better in Dallas Fort Worth, we were back to near sold-out conditions at Midlothian. So, I think that puts a bow around it. Thank you. I think we'd be naive to assume the degrees of inflation haven't eaten into that. And so when we went back over time, I've said before, whatever the volume that people thought would come out of IIJA, the year it was signed in the law. Have you seen some of that being eroded by inflation? Yes, I think so. But at the end of the day, very selfishly from a Martin Marietta perspective, would we trade the volume that we see for the pricing that we're seeing? The answer is yes. I think part of what's so important to keep in mind too is I don't think IIJA is a one-hit wonder. In other words, I think we simply changed the floor in the way that the United States Congress and the government will continue to invest in infrastructure because keep in mind, we went 1.5 decades with woefully under-funded infrastructure. So I think in many respects, yes, some degree of volume has been taken out simply because of inflation. At the same time, I believe when we see a reauthorization of this act, we're likely to see something at/or above where this is. And again, it would provide a nice extended period of time for the United States to invest in this much-needed infrastructure. At the same time, it will allow us to make sure that we're getting the appropriate return for our very valuable materials that are in the ground and that we work hard to turn into a spec product. So that's the way that we think about it. There's nothing per se new in that, but I think it's important to be able to articulate that to the investing public, because I think from our perspective, it works. Thank you. No. Look, we've certainly told the market that we are looking to have another dialogue in September. Obviously, it's not yet September. So we'll have to see how that goes, Keith. But again, there are a lot of different cement markets across the United States. And Dallas is a really good cement market. And, obviously, Dallas had a strange market in Q2 simply because it was wet. But when Martin Marietta was buying TXI back in 2014 and 2015, I remember very clearly what I said to our Board of Directors at the time, and that was -- I felt like Dallas-Fort Worth might well be the single most attractive heavy side building materials market in the United States for the next 25 years. It has not disappointed. So have we told our customers that we're going to have a dialogue in September? Yes. Am I ready to tell you what that's going to look like? The answer is no. But in any event, to your point, as I've watched public data come out, I concur with your conclusion, I haven't seen a market that has reacted more attractively than DFW has on pricing on a percentage basis. Thank you, Keith. Yeah. Thanks, Collin. Thanks for the question. We try at this point now that those operations are really fully integrated. I wanted to break some out for the quarter because we were going through the integration process, but now that they're fully integrated, we just think about it candidly at this point is all organic going forward. I mean, clearly, I gave some, I thought, helpful color relative to end users and what we thought the shifts are going to be relative to up, down, sideways, et cetera. But again, if we're looking at the second half of the year on infrastructure, we think it's going to be a busy second half of the year. At the same time, the biggest things that we're trying to get our heads around is what we're navigating right now and what will be the fallout from, as I said, what, July and what has so far been a wet August with the hurricane making its way literally from somewhere between Myrtle Beach and Charleston right now, eventually up through the Greensboro High Point area. So those are more of the swing factors in the near term and in the longer term, this year, to the extent there can be longer term this year, it's really going to be more driven by when winter sets in and what the effects of that may be in certain markets. So I can remember years that we were doing asphalt and paving in Colorado in December. That doesn't happen very often, but it does happen. And those will be your swing factors really as we think about volumes but more granularly as we think about infrastructure. I think it starts to show up reasonably early in 2025 because I do think in portions of private, particularly in homebuilding, et cetera, you've got the pent-up demand. And it's interesting as we have people looking to move to Raleigh, one of the issues that they chronically run into. And by the way, I'm using Raleigh as an example, but we could go across our footprint and say the same thing. The inventories is really very low. And frankly, from our perspective, that's a pretty high-class problem, Collin. Is it tough for people moving to the area because they can't find a home that they want? Yes. Does it mean, however, that once you have that more accommodating policy that you're going to see homebuilders moving, we think, with alacrity to fill what's a needed hole right now. We think that's the case. And that tends to be, particularly if they've made the investment in land, which in many instances they have, that they can move relatively quickly and keep in mind a portion of what we're going to capture as residential will be those streets. It will be that curb and gutter. It will be the sidewalks. It will be the utilities until those subdivisions are turned over to the local municipality for maintenance. So what we see on the resi side, I think so, does that mean that you're going to see light non-res come behind it in that more abbreviated period, I think so. And all that underlies what we think will be a continuing attractive infrastructure setting. So again, I hope that's helpful. You bet, Colline. So happy to, Jim, you want to ahead and take the first and I'll come back on where we're focused? Well, I think Jim really hit very, very nicely, a, what the percentages look like; b, what the emphasis is going to be. Obviously, we're going to be focused on maintenance and repairs because we've seen those up disproportionately. But we're also seeing general inflation come down. We are seeing some nice tailwinds coming from portions of energy. It's been a bit of a bifurcated situation, though, because we've seen diesel clearly better. We've seen electric modestly up. But again, managing our hours managing our over time, keeping our people safe will be areas that we will have a unique focus as we always do in the second half of the year. But I think you will see a better trend on repairs in particular. You bet. Good to talk to you, Joe. So Tyler, thank you for the question. So I would say two things. One, we are getting closer. We are getting ever closer to harmony in the Western U.S. So pretty soon, you can start humming that music. I think that's going to be there. But here's the other thought that I would have for you I'm not sure we're looking for harmony in the West. I think the West ought to be a price leader because as we look at the cost of doing business in California as we look at barriers to entry in California, just a host of things. The West Coast businesses should never, in my view, have been businesses priced below a Martin Marietta heritage number. And I think there should be a premium associated with businesses in that geography, because you've got at times some premium costs associated with that geography. Now, to the rest of your question, should there be recovery in places like Tennessee and elsewhere as we continue to go through the synergy realization process of the Blue Water operations. The answer is yes, there should be. And as I indicated, I think in some of my earlier commentary, there's over $4 a ton delta right now between the average in those locations and heritage Martin Marietta. So to your point, should there be an extended period of goodness in that. The answer is yes because, obviously, the heritage footprint or price profile will continue to go up as we continue to move up at the Blue Water operations as well and get those closer to that harmony point that we spoke of before. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me as I look at our portfolio that North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee would or should look materially different. And that's where we're endeavoring to take the business. Thank you, Tyler. Good morning. Happy to. And it's really a tale of two different businesses there. So if we're looking just at revenues, as Jim said in his comments, they were relatively flat. Now as we look at that, chemicals up around 7%, lime though, up 24%. And what we're seeing is pricing gains are more than offsetting lower chemical shipments. So chemical markets around the world. And keep in mind, this is not just a regional business. This is a business that we cover the US and we have double-digit international business there as well. So we obviously saw volumes down, we saw pricing up. So you're seeing a lot of the same dynamics in the Magnesia Specialties business that we're seeing overall in the aggregates business as well. Part of what I'm pleased with is steel utilization levels are remaining just above the 70% historical average, that's not a terribly high number. And what our team has been able to do there is several fold. One, control costs really well. Number two, they're going about their commercial strategy in a fundamental fundamentally different way. That's been a business that historically has had longer-term contracts, and they've been in a position revisit those contracts, reset them and make sure that, again, same circumstances aggregates. We've got long-lived reserves at our facility in Woodville, Ohio. We have long-lived brine reserves in Manistee, Michigan. At the same time, we need to be getting good value for those. And Chris Sanborski and his team have managed both sides of that business, controlling costs well and controlling pricing really well. And the EBITDA numbers that we're seeing in that business based on the volume in that business. Frankly, looks fundamentally different today than it would have two or three years ago under the same economic circumstances. So I'm very pleased with that business. The other thing that I'll say, too, it wasn't part of your question, but I think it underscores the efficiency of the business. Their safety numbers have also gotten notably better. And you just see that business going in a direction that we're very pleased with. And what's probably one of the tougher economies that any sector of our business is dealing with. And they're likely to come in with a record EBITDA year this year. And that's the type of performance in this setting that makes us really excited about what Martin Marietta is going to look like in 2025, 2026, 2027, et cetera. You bet. Good morning, Timna. So Timna, thank you so much. What we're not seeing -- I don't think we're seeing a real slowdown in public relative to the election. So I think that just chugs along. I think that can have an effect on private. And I think that's probably some of what we've seen in the first half of this year. So I think that's probably just more of the same. Relative to public and what that could look like on IIJA reauthorization or the Inflation Reduction Act or otherwise. Yes, I would say several things. One, I think we're relatively agnostic. And here's why, Timna. Look, I think if you have a democratic administration that's in power this next time. My guess is IIJA looks pretty similar on a reauthorization basis and then you continue to see things like the Inflation Reduction Act. I think if you have a Republican administration, honestly, you probably have a more amped up infrastructure law and probably less IRA. And again, from our perspective, they're probably almost awash, and again, if we're looking at where the big investments are going to be made in highways, bridges, roads and streets, it's going to follow where people are. It's going to be driven by what's happening with DOT budgets, and it's going to be happening driven by what happens at the ballot box, where most of these places that are seeing big population trends continue to pass initiatives at well over 80% rates of passage, and we think that's going to endure. Frankly, if we've looked at the last several elections and you look at what's passed, almost half of it tends to be in Texas. And again, it goes back to building that marketplace that we have in Dallas Fort Worth and San Antonio and in Houston. And again, relative to what we see going on in energy and otherwise, I think that can move around a little bit depending on whether we have regime change. But if you build your businesses the way that we have on major commerce corridors, that's where the activity is going to be, whether it's factories, whether it's industrial, whether it's energy or otherwise. And that's why the positions we have along the I-85 corridor, the I-95 corridor, the I-25 corridor, the I-35 corridor and the I-5 corridor are so important to us. And keep in mind, Timna, we're the largest shipper of crushed stone on the railroads for a reason. We're the largest shipper of stone on BNUP. Number one on CSX, number two on Norfolk Southern and now number one on the Canadians after they bought the Kansas City Southern. And to the extent that this industrial buildout continues on either commerce by truck or commerce by rail, we're going to be well suited by that. And I think that's why from an election perspective, we're relatively agnostic and I think we're going to be good either way, and we love that durability. Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. Martin Marietta has built a durable and resilient business poised to continue outperforming through dynamic macroeconomic cycles. Our compelling underlying fundamentals, dedicated teams, well-defined strategic plan, carefully curated coast-to-coast footprint in the country's fastest-growing markets and unparalleled attractive growth opportunities reinforce our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to continue delivering sustainable growth and superior shareholder value now and into the future. We look forward to sharing our third quarter 2024 results with your fall. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "Jim Nickolas",
            "content": "Thank you, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned and shown in today's release, we revised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.2 billion at the midpoint, reflecting our first half results and revised second half shipment expectations. In the second quarter, the Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 3% and gross profit of $501 million, a decrease of 7%. The decline in both metrics is attributable to the divestiture of our South Texas Cement and related concrete businesses as well as shipment declines experienced in the quarter, most notably due to wet weather, partially offset by contributions of the Albert Frei & Sons and Blue Water acquisitions. The net positive impact of acquisitions and divestitures in the second quarter was $7 million of adjusted EBITDA. Our aggregates pipeline established second quarter records for revenues and gross profit as contributions from acquired operations and strong pricing more than offset lower shipments. Aggregates gross profit per ton improved 9% to a second quarter record of $7.41. That number is inclusive of the $20 million or $0.37 per ton non-recurring, non-cash purchase accounting impact of the fair market value write-up of inventory related to the Blue Water acquisition, which was fully recognized in the second quarter. Excluding this purchase accounting impact, gross profit per ton increased 14%. These impressive results reveal and affirm how our disciplined commercial strategy and flexible cost structure yields higher profits despite lower volumes. Cement and concrete revenue decreased 37% to $261 million, and gross profit decreased 44% to $72 million, again, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas Cement plant and its related concrete operations and secondarily, by significant wet April, May and early June weather in Dallas-Fort Worth. Notably, our strategic Midlothian cement plants daily shipping rates returned to near sold-out levels exiting the quarter. Remember, too, we expect our new finish mill [ph] to be operational in the third quarter, which has the capacity to add approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity in the attractive North Texas market. Our asphalt and paving revenues and gross profit increased modestly to $245 million and $37 million, respectively, both second quarter records in large measure due to pricing improvements and energy cost tailwinds. Magnesia Specialties revenues of $81 million were in line with the prior year quarter, while gross profit decreased 2% to $27 million. Strong pricing, improved maintenance cost management and energy cost tailwinds, counterbalance lower chemicals and lime shipments. SOAR has long provided the framework we use to grow our business and deploy capital for long-term success. During the first half of this year, we deployed over $2.5 billion on pure-play aggregates acquisitions, invested $339 million of capital into our business and returned $542 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In the second quarter alone, we repurchased 530,000 shares at an average price of $566 per share. Since our repurchase authorization announced in February 2015, we returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2 times as of June 30, at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, providing balance sheet strength and ample flexibility to actively pursue our M&A pipeline, reinvest in our business and extend our long track record of returning capital to Martin Marietta shareholders, all while preserving financial flexibility and our investment-grade credit rating profile. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. Yeah. Last year, Kathryn, second half of the year, about 60% of consolidated EBITDA came through in Q3 and 40% came through in Q4. Because of what we're seeing this year with weather, et cetera, in July and even August, the split is probably closer to 55% Q3, 45% in Q4, so a little bit more Q4 weighted this year than normal. Yeah. No, you're right, those ballpark numbers are correct. The star of the show, as always, has been growing ASP. So that's flowing through in the second half of the year. That's the primary metric that's driving that improved margin, Jerry. Secondary impact is, as I mentioned in prior calls, inflation is abating. It's moderating as the year goes on. So the cost pressures are by and large, coming back down, not to where they were at pre-COVID, of course, but 5% to 6% on baseline cost inflation. So those two things are the main driver. Thank you, Jerry. Yes. So that project, the finish mill 7, as we call it, will be completed this quarter. As you know, it's 450,000 tons per year of annual production capacity. So give or take, 110-ish thousand ton per quarter. We won't hit the market with that full speed on day one. We'll be responsible about feathering in those volumes to ensure we don't disrupt the commercial strategy we've been following in that marketplace. So more to come on when that comes out, but that will be helpful to us, a, in terms of volume, but also more importantly, operational flexibility, wait time for customers, storage facilities, our ability to react to different events is enhanced as a result of this project. So we're looking for this to improve margins going forward and of course, volumes as those become available to us. Yeah. Well, simply, there's a couple of things that go into that. One is we are well-below our target leverage ratio. And we had entered the year with the quarter with over $2 billion in cash on the balance sheet. So that was part of it. But, of course, we thought the stock price was at an attractive level as well. We thought it was under undervalued. So that's really -- it's as simple as that. We're pretty opportunistic about our stock buyback, Try to avoid a lazy balance sheet at the same time, and those things just coalesce this quarter. Thank you, Adam. Yeah. So the full year guide on COGS per ton it's -- well, second half rather to be more precise is up 7% second half of this year versus second half last year. It's reflective of, again, general inflation slowly coming down. There's a little bit of under-absorption in that as well as the volumes come down versus their old -- our old view. Then the repairs and maintenance costs have remained elevated. We've seen some improvement as we -- as volumes have come down on contract services. The outsourced services have been reduced, lower over time. And of course, we do have a bit of diesel tailwind built in, so that's helpful too."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the company's website.\n I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms.  Jacklyn Rooker, Martin Marietta's Director of Investor Relations. Jacklyn, you may begin. \nJacklyn Rooker: Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, Martin Marietta is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. We undertake no obligation, except as legally required to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.\n Please refer to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other public filings, which are available on both our own and the Securities and Exchange Commission's website. We have made available during this webcast and on the Investors section of our website, supplemental information that summarizes our financial results and trends.\n As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for continuing operations. In addition, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix to the supplemental information as well as our filings with the SEC and are also available on our website.\n Ward and I will begin today's earnings call with a discussion of our first quarter operating performance and our recently completed transactions as well as market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results and capital allocation. After which, Ward will provide some brief concluding remarks. A question-and-answer session will follow. Please limit your Q&A participation to 1 question.  \n I will now turn the call over to Ward. \nC. Nye: Thank you, Jacklyn, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta's continued growth and results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined adherence to and execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or store plan.  \n With the nadir, that is always the industry's first quarter concluded in the 2024 construction season meaningfully underway, we remain confident that steady product demand supporting favorable commercial dynamics continued adherence to our value over volume strategy, ongoing operational excellence undertakings and portfolio optimizing transactions will position Martin Marietta for continued outperformance in 2024 and beyond.\n As detailed in today's earnings release, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range to $2.30 billion to $2.44 billion or $2.37 billion at the midpoint. This increase reflects the benefits that will be realized from the recently acquired Blue Water operations as well as strong realization of this year's pricing actions. As is customary, we'll revisit our guidance again at midyear.\n Consistent with our SOAR 2025 initiatives, we've executed $4.5 billion of portfolio-enhancing transactions this year, reducing cyclical downstream exposure while redeploying the proceeds to expand our aggregates footprint and improve our ability to generate consistently higher margins. More specifically, on January 12, we completed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, strengthening our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area.\n And on April 5, we acquired 20 aggregate operations from Blue Water Industries providing us a new growth platform in Tennessee and Florida. These 2 pure-play aggregates transactions are expected to add approximately 17 million tons of annual shipments and generate approximately $180 million of annualized EBITDA, more than offsetting the EBITDA from the February 9 divestiture of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. These transactions are all reflected in our revised adjusted EBITDA guidance as of their respective closing dates.\n Turning now to the company's first quarter operating performance. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, increasing 12.2% or 12.7% on an organic mix adjusted basis, underscoring the advantages of our value over volume commercial strategy, and our sales team's unwavering commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves. Aggregate shipments declined 12.3% due largely to the well chronic cold weather impacted start to the year in our East and Southwest divisions and softening demand in warehouse, office and retail construction partially offset by more favorable weather and relative strength in our Central and West divisions. Aggregates product line gross profit per ton increased 14% and gross margin expanded by 90 basis points notwithstanding the shipment decline.\n Looking ahead, we remain enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end uses of Public Works, nonresidential and residential construction. More specifically, we believe these markets in Martin Marietta's chosen geographies will drive aggregates intensive growth and favorable pricing trends for the foreseeable future. We expect robust multiyear demand in public infrastructure, U.S.-based manufacturing, energy projects and data center construction will partially offset near-term softness in warehouse, light nonresidential and residential end markets. That said, we fully expect the housing recovery, particularly in single-family once affordability challenges subside as demand in our key markets remains robust.\n Infrastructure activity is expected to continue to grow in 2024 as early Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA projects advance to the major construction phase. Notably, according to the annual market outlook provided by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, public highway, batement and street construction, the largest market sector is expected to increase 16% to $126 billion in 2024 as compared with $109 billion in 2023 as record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, match federal funds and provide additional investments.\n The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand grew 11% to $116 billion for the 12-month period ending February 29, 2024. This generational investment in our nation's infrastructure supported by federal, state and local actions provides state DOTs with certainty to advance projects in their backlogs, driving sustained multiyear demand in this aggregate intensive often countercyclical market.\n Shifting to the heavy nonresidential market, manufacturing projects continue to be supported by steady demand from ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, Construction spending for domestic manufacturing continues to trend positively with the February ceasing adjusted annual rate of spending for 2024 a $223 billion, a 32% increase from the February 2023 value of $169 billion. Equally, we expect the long-term secular trends towards cloud-based services and artificial intelligence will drive renewed growth in data center construction, which had moderated from a post-COVID peak.\n As an example, in March, Google announced a new $1 billion data center in Kansas City to help drive its artificial intelligence efforts, which requires nearly 800,000 tons of aggregates from our uniquely positioned underground operations.\n Looking at the light nonresidential market, we expect 2024 demand will be challenged given higher for longer interest rates, high office vacancy rates and the natural construction lag from the last 2 years of single-family residential declines. As for the residential market, despite near-term uncertainty around mortgage rates, we're encouraged by positive trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregates demand, which were 1 million units in March 2024, a nearly 21% increase from a year ago.\n Notably, single-family housing starts have been at or above 1 million units since November 2023, indicative of a recovery from the 2023 trough. Given the well-publicized structural housing deficit in our company's key metropolitan areas, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit disproportionately from new home construction once interest rates moderate and monthly mortgage payments become more affordable.\n I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter financial results. Jim? \nJames Nickolas: Thanks, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned and indicated in our earnings release, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EBIT guidance to $2.37 billion at the midpoint and our full year 2024 aggregates gross profit guidance to $1.75 billion at the midpoint. The updated guidance for Aggregates gross profit includes a $30 million nonrecurring noncash purchase accounting impact expected in the second quarter the fair market value write-up of inventory related to the Blue Water acquisition.\n The Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 8% and gross profit of $248 million, a decrease of 10%. The vast majority of the decline in both metrics is due to the effect of our divestiture of our South Texas cement and ready-mix business. A much smaller portion of the decline was due to shipments impacted by tougher weather this quarter compared to the prior year's unseasonably favorable weather conditions. Despite the lower shipment volumes, Aggregates gross profit increased modestly to $239 million, and gross margin increased 90 basis points to 27%. These results reflect our team's focus on what we can control specifically the efficacy of our commercial discipline and flexible cost structure, which drives higher profits without the benefit of growing volumes.\n Turning to our Texas cement and targeted downstream businesses. Our Cement and Concrete revenues decreased 22% to $265 million and gross profit decreased 47% to $31 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations and secondarily by wet weather in Texas. Additionally, the new finish mill at our Midlothian cement plant in North Texas, which will add approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity is still on track to be operational in the third quarter of 2024. Consistent with typical seasonal trends in relevant geographies, the asphalt and paving business posted a $22 million gross loss as our Minnesota-based asphalt facilities are inactive during the first quarter due to winter operational shutdowns and our Colorado-based operations experienced unfavorable winter conditions.\n Magnesia Specialties achieved an all-time quarterly gross profit record of $29 million despite a 3% decrease in revenues to $81 million as strong pricing, improved maintenance cost control and energy tailwinds more than offset continued headwinds in metal mining end markets. Our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities remain focused on responsibly growing our business through value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. In the first quarter, we invested $200 million of capital into our business. We also returned to shareholders almost $200 million during the quarter with $150 million of that used to repurchase over 255,000 shares at an average price of $586.85.\n Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x as of March 31. Assuming no further M&A activity, we expect net leverage to be 1.4x by year-end below our targeted range of 2.0 to 2.5x providing a strong balance sheet to capitalize on a robust acquisition pipeline. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. \nC. Nye: Jim, thanks so much. To conclude, we expect 2024 will be another year of significant achievement for Martin Marietta. We're well positioned to benefit from infrastructure tailwinds, providing steady product demand and favorable commercial dynamics across our coast-to-coast footprint. Over the past 30 years, since the public company, Martin Marietta has built a resilient and durable business. We'll continue to build on the foundation that has proven so successful an aggregates-led platform with an unwavering commitment to safety, commercial and operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic priorities.\n If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.\n All right. We're going to proceed with the next question. And your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. \nTrey Grooms: Yes. Sorry about that for Kathryn. You all have clearly been very busy with acquisitions and overall portfolio optimization. And I know it's early days, but maybe if you could talk about kind of the integration of AFS and BWI. How that's going so far, maybe where you see opportunities there? And then with that, relative to the information you've given us in the past, I think you might be adjusting your view of the demand environment just a little bit, but taking up the ASP and maybe even the stand-alone EBITDA guide a bit. First off, do I have that right? And maybe could you help us out with that? \nC. Nye: You do have it right. And thanks for the questions. I'll try to do with all 3 parts. So let's talk first about integration, and your question is a good one. And look, you've -- we closed on Frei. We closed on Blue Water. The transactions went well. And the nice thing from our perspective, one, our teams have done this and done a lot and done it well. Number two, we typically close on a Friday, and we open up on Monday morning and it's a Martin Marietta operation. It has our signs, it has our tickets, they're on our networks, and that's exactly what we've seen. So again, the blocking, the tackling and the people integration is complete, and it's exactly where you would expect it to be based on our history.\n Now from a commercial excellence and operational excellence integration perspective, a couple of views on that. If we're looking at the commercial excellence, I mean, given the fact that we closed on Blue Water relatively quickly, number one, we were able to announce midyears in all of those markets effective July 15. And we generally ought to provide people with at least 90 days of notice to our customers. So again, the early closing of Blue Water worked to our advantage in that respect.\n With regard to operational excellence, several things that I think are worth noting, look, we look for quick wins. We're looking for suppliers. We're looking to spend more on favorable contracts that typically happens within the first 90 days without any incremental CapEx, we're seeing that. Longer term, we're obviously going to be looking at plant upgrades. We're looking at fleet modernization. And that typically takes some time, and it's got a CapEx component. And actually, one of the things that you'll see in the guidance is CapEx is up modestly, and that's up modestly because of things just like that in addition to what we feel like could be some opportunistic land purchases later.\n One thing relative to BWI in particular, keep in mind that was a carve-out. So no corporate SG&A came with that business. So it was already basically synergized from that perspective. So again, all of that has actually gone very nicely, Trey. The other piece of it that you mentioned, and you're right on if we're looking overall at volume, you remember when we came out at the year, not taking these transactions into account, we said we thought minus 2% to plus 2%. Midpoint was 0. What we're seeing now because of interest longer, really a bit of a weather-impacted start to the year.\n And the fact is if we look at 5 million tons down in Q1, if we parse that, several things worth noting. One, there were 3 less shipping days in this quarter than there were last year. That's probably about let's call that a couple of million tons by itself. But if we're looking then at the balance, which is quite about 3 million tons really, Trey. I mean about 1/3 of that was slower private, about 1/3 of that was weather, and about 1/3 of that is value over volume.\n So again, when we're taking those components into account, and we're looking at organic or heritage volume, but we think we're probably closer to the lower end of that original guide, let's call it down 2%, down 3%. And then what you're seeing in the new guide, takes the acquisitions effect into account. So hopefully, that gives you the bridge that you wanted, Trey. So I'll try to go through the integration components of it and then deal also with the volume bridge. Was there a piece of your question I did not respond to yet? \nTrey Grooms: Yes. Ward, the one thing was just, again, there's a lot of moving pieces here. But just based on some of the information you've given us in the past about BWI in particular, it seems like maybe you're just in that kind of stand-alone EBITDA guide up a bit. Do I have that right? \nC. Nye: No, we are. So if you look at the overall EBITDA midpoint, it's now $2.37 billion. Now that's 11% over where we were last year. So take that into account that basically, we're going to give you a year's worth of Blue Water in only 9 months. So that's one way to think of it. But the other thing that's important to state is we're also seeing improvement in the Heritage business as well. So we're getting a 2 for there. We're getting the benefit of Blue Water, by the way, which we think there's going to be more to come. We're also seeing improvement in the Heritage business you can see, among other things, we raised the aggregate pricing to 12% at the midpoint.\n So again, that's going to include some degree of midyear this year. And keeping in mind some of the difficulty that we have is if we're looking at pricing that was at Frei and pricing that was at Blue Water, their pricing was actually below Heritage Martin Marietta pricing. So the pricing that you're seeing and the changes that you're seeing are despite the overall headwind that we actually have from the new businesses that we brought in, Trey. So I hope that helps relative to the EBITDA range and what we're doing relative to pricing as well. \nTrey Grooms: Yes. Very helpful color, Ward. Very encouraging, and good luck for the rest of the year. \nOperator: And we'll be taking the next question again from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. \nKathryn Thompson: Just a cleanup question from your prior answer, which was very helpful around guidance. Just a clarification, how much of the pricing guidance takes into account midyear pricing actions? And also any other factors that we should take into account given a change in mix from acquired and the opportunities for pricing with those acquisitions?\n And then finally, if I could just do one follow-on with Magnesia Specialties. While a small portion of EBITDA contribution, you had a very good quarter, what can we read through from a broader macro perspective on this business segment's outperformance? \nC. Nye: Thank you, Kathryn. So a couple of things. One, if we're looking at the pricing guide that we've given for the rest of the year, I mean here's the direct answer. It's got some mid years. It doesn't have everything that we believe we're going to see. So what does that mean? It means that now that we bought Blue Water, we've already indicated to those customers, they're going to get midyears. So we've built that in. As you may recall, coming into the year, we had indicated that we had not put it in guidance. We had already indicated to our customers in California that they were going to get midyears, that has been worked on.\n So there have been some very specific midyears that have been worked into the numbers that you see. So the numbers that you're seeing reflect 2 things: some very direct midyears, very nice realization of the beginning year increases that we put in. But the fact is, we still think we're going to see some more mid-years at midyear. So what that tells you is you should expect us to come back with more color on what that looks like. when we're reporting during the summertime. So that's the way I would ask you to think about that.\n Now relative to Mag Specialties, I would say several things. Number one, the chemical markets globally are still very difficult markets. Now that said, Mag just had its best quarter ever. So I'd say a couple of things are worth reading through on that. Number one is steel doing relatively well. It is. Is it blowing the doors off? It's not. So it tells us that business is actually performing quite well. So steel utilization is about at 72%. So if we're looking at the way that business is overall going, I'm actually very pleased with it.\n I think a read-through that you may be looking at is this. One of the things that we're seeing begin to recover nicely is TPO roofing. And that tells us now as we're looking at degrees of manufacturing and that manufacturing renaissance that we can look for across the United States that TPO roofing is what we're going to see in a lot of these data centers and a lot of these new battery plants and others. So typically, we're watching those products go into larger industrial uses. But when we're seeing TPO roofing recover, -- if you're looking for that read through, Kathryn, I don't think that's a bad read through. \nKathryn Thompson: Very helpful. And best of luck. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. \nStanley Elliott: Ward, can you talk a little bit about kind of what you're seeing from an end market perspective? You mentioned about kind of some building into from a volume standpoint as we're kind of moving through the rest of the year. And I apologize if some of this was covered on some of the others. I've had some technical difficulties as well. But would love to kind of give some color on what's happening across the end market. \nC. Nye: Stanley, thank you for the question. Happy to do so. I mean, look, let's start with infrastructure, which is our single largest end use and an end use that we think is going to get nicely larger. Look, we see that up mid-single to high single digits this year for several reasons. One, you've got the bipartisan infrastructure law that's going to be coming in, in a meaningful way this year. Build into '25 even more meaningfully. So we see that working in a very significant way in a multi-year fashion. Keep in mind, too, we've got very healthy DOTs in our chosen geographies.\n If we're looking at our top 10 states, those budgets are up around 10% year-over-year. And last year, keep in mind, those budgets were pretty attractive. I mentioned in my prepared comments that if we're looking at the last 12 months highway, bridge and tunnel awards, those were up 12%. That's $116 billion versus $104 billion during the prior period. And the other thing that I think people forget is what's happening at local levels relative to ballot initiatives and what we saw last year were about $7 billion of transportation funding approved in 2023 that we'll see in the marketplace this year. So again, we think infrastructure looks attractive.\n If we're looking at non-res, our view is still largely the same. We think that's down probably mid-single digits, perhaps a little bit more. Keep in mind, of the portion of our business that is non-res. Around 55% of it is heavy non-res and about 45% of it is light non-res. And by the way, we think that's a pretty good break and we like the way that looks. Now if we're thinking about heavy, several things that worth keeping in mind. One, we put in the supplemental slides the fact that there's $53 billion worth of CHIPS Act money and about $250 billion of Inflation Reduction Act money that will be flowing through those sectors over the next several years. But what we're seeing more specifically is demand for heavy side energy and domestic manufacturing. That continues to be really resilient. And we think that's offsetting moderation in degrees of distribution and warehousing.\n Now where we are seeing some green shoots, and I think this is important, is in AI and in data centers. So for example, I mentioned Google is building a new facility in Kansas City. It's going to take about 800,000 tons but it's not just there. I mean, we're seeing it across the Midwest. We're seeing it in Omaha. We're seeing it in Des Moines. And we're going to be a disproportionate beneficiary of that due to the availability of land and wind power in those states where we actually have a very significant interest.\n Now light non-res is, in fact, in our view, going to be impacted near term by the high interest rates for longer and office vacancy rates. And I think that partly goes back to the commentary that I was having with Trey relative to what we see going on with organic volume. So that's certainly a piece of it. And resi, we see that down, let's call it, low single digits, maybe modestly higher than that. We think softness will persist there as we continue navigating this period of higher mortgage rates that's impacting affordability. I think clearly, people are thinking today that mortgage rates are going to remain higher than they would have thought in February. And I think that's part of the reality of it.\n But I do like the recent trends. I mean if we're looking at recent trends in single-family housing starts are encouraging because since last November, the starts have been at 1 million units, and that's a nearly 21% year-over-year increase, and we know the demand is going to have to be met with new construction. And again, if you take a look at the states with big population inflows I mean think about these states and think about Martin Marietta Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, et cetera. So far we think near-term single-family housing is going to be a modest headwind, we think long term, it's going to be really very attractive.\n So our view is if we look at infrastructure and think about how that's going to build multiyear, we look at res, think about how that's going to build multiyear look at the heavy side of non-res, we think that's going to continue to be very resilient. And we think the light nonres is going to come behind res most likely with that 6- to 9-month lag. So Stanley, I hope that helps. \nStanley Elliott: Great color, Ward, and best of luck. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. \nAnthony Pettinari: With the portfolio moves, it looks like you'll raise your aggregates mix from high 60s to high 70s in terms of gross profit. And my question is, is there kind of a long-term target percentage that you envision there and understanding you'll continue to grow aggregates organically and through acquisitions. I'm just wondering if you could talk about kind of the role you see Mag and the remaining cement assets playing in the broader portfolio? \nC. Nye: I'd say several things. Number one, we are an aggregates-led company, and we've always told people that's what you should expect us to be. And the moves that we have made are totally consistent with that. So should you expect to see aggregates number go up largely because I think we'll be buying relatively aggregates pure businesses? I think the answer to that question is yes.\n Equally though, if we pivot and talk about the other 2 businesses that you spoke up, remember, we've long spoken of the criticality of strategic cement. And we've said strategic cement is where we're an aggregates leader where the market is naturally vertically integrated, where we have a significant downstream business, meaning ready-mix concrete, that takes a significant portion of the cement and where it cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water.\n And the fact is that is precisely what Midlothian means to us. And one of the things that you will keep in mind, Anthony, we've got 450,000 tons worth of annual capacity that will be coming on at Midlothian this year in Q3. So we continue to invest in that business because we like that business, and we very much like being in that business in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n Equally, if you look at the Magnesia Specialties business, and keep in mind that's a business that we have about $100 million worth of investment in. That's a business that's going to make over $100 million a year. And frankly, it's a business that if we can find ways to responsibly grow it, they've earned that right because from a margin perspective, that's a hugely attractive business. So the way that we think of it, yes, is it aggregates led, you bet. Are we looking in particular at those 3 big upstream businesses is driving the vast majority of our revenues and profits.\n And the upstream businesses, meaning, number one, aggregates; number two, cement; number three, Mag specialties. So yes, you will see that aggregates percentage go up. And yes, your number was right. I mean we're sitting here today looking at gross profit from aggregates at about 77%. And if we look to where we were a year ago, it was somewhere sub-70%, closer to 69%. So expect that number to keep going up but I hope I've also outlined to you the way that we think about our very important and very good cement business in Dallas-Fort Worth and a high-performing Magnesia Specialties business as well. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. \nJatin Khanna: Good morning, everyone. This is Jatin Khanna on behalf of Jerry Revich. From a portfolio standpoint, what has driven significant deal opportunities for you? And is there a scope for further asset refinement for the industry? What's the range of additional M&A that's feasible based on your pipeline? \nC. Nye: Thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, we have looked in the markets in which we want to grow and in the markets, most importantly, that we can grow. So we have several things that advantage is. Number one, the condition of our balance sheet. So if you look at our balance sheet, we are in a position that we can grow and we can continue to grow smartly. Number two, if you look at the transactions that we've done, I think you'll look at the transactions and say that we have done those in a wise and prudent fashion.\n If we look at businesses that we want to buy in markets in which we want to enter, by our math, we found businesses that on a per annum basis, produce and sell about 238 million tons of aggregates per annum. Here's the way to capture that. Basically, there's another Martin Marietta that's out there that we believe we have the ability over time to buy. Now can I sit here and tell you from a linear perspective exactly what that's going to look like? No, I can't.\n But can I tell you that I believe, economically, geographically, regulatorily and otherwise that we are uniquely positioned to do that, in my view, better than any other publicly held company in the United States. I believe that we are. And of course, I look at the world through Martin Marietta lenses, but I also believe that's a good clinical view of where we are. Our team is good at that. We're good at identifying businesses. We're good at the contracting phase of it. And as you heard during our earlier comments, we're very good at the integration and synergy phase of it as well. And our shareholders like what we do from M&A.\n So will it continue to be our first call on capital, if we've got the right deal? The answer is it will. So our capital priorities remain the same. The right deal is, #1, investing in the business responsibly is #2, and returning cash to shareholders through a meaningful and sustainable dividend and through share repurchases remains #3. And my guess is those will be our priorities for quite a while. So again, I hope that's responsive to your question. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley. \nAngel Castillo Malpica: And Ward, just to build off that last comment there, it sounds like nothing is really changing there in terms of the capital allocation priorities. But curious, as M&A perhaps or the opportunities to do things at attractive multiples as you have done in kind of the last several quarters here. Just curious as you think about the valuation, one, how is it evolving in terms of the pipeline opportunities?\n And two, I think some of your peers have talked about their ability to do greenfields in kind of a shorter period of time is 4 years. So just help us understand, I guess, maybe how that's evolving with rates, where they are with the valuations where they are, just any kind of puts and takes there in terms of opportunities around greenfields as well as M&A. \nC. Nye: Yes. Thank you for the question. Number one, what I would say is when we go through a transaction and look at what we can do from a synergy perspective on making the operations safer, on making the operations more efficient and making sure that we can bring more products to market. The ability to go through a business and synergize it from those perspectives so it works for our customers is important, and that's precisely what we've been able to do at Blue Water, and that's what we're doing right now at Albert Frei. And through that type of process that we have, we can take what might otherwise look like a relatively high multiple. And by the time we're done with it, bring it to a multiple that you look at, and I look at our shareholders look at and feel like that's a very attractive model.\n Our view is that's the way that we're going to continue growing our business. Now from a land use and planning perspective, look, we're good at that, too. We're good at identifying property. We're got going through the zoning, we're going to going through special use permitting. But frankly, you're going to see more of that adjacent to ongoing operations than you will from a greenfield perspective. And one reason I feel that way. Look, I think 4 years is a pretty heady time frame to think about a greenfield operation. I think a more realistic time frame is probably 7 to 10 years. And if we think about the difference in cash flow, getting a meaningful profit in buying a business today as opposed to greenfielding, we think that's a more constructive way to do it.\n The other thing to keep in mind is we're an awfully long way away from being anywhere near peak volumes in our business. So we're looking at reserves in the ground today that are nearly 70 years at current extraction rates. So our need to go out and put in greenfield locations is not terribly high. Our need in some instances, for example, in California and what we did in Colorado years ago in buying adjacent properties, bulking up what looks like a 30-year reserve position in California, it's something that's going to be a lot longer. We think that's a very sensible way to go through land purchase.\n And you heard me speak earlier in our CapEx number we're looking at some opportunistic land purchases. But I would expect us to do M&A, I would expect us to do within multiples that to us, and I believe to you, will look quite reasonable, and I would look for us not to do so much greenfielding but to be more focused in our heritage business and adding reserves to existing locations. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Loop Capital Markets. \nGarik Shmois: I was hoping if you could speak to what you're seeing on the cost side. Obviously, you had good margin performance in aggregates in the quarter despite the weaker volumes, just wondering if you could speak to any updated cost assumptions if anything has changed since the beginning of the year? \nJames Nickolas: Yes. Garik, Jim here. I think I indicated at the last quarter's call about 7% COGS per ton inflation. I think that's still accurate for the full year. I would say that inflation rate will be higher in the first half of the year and lower in the back half of the year, but a blended average of 7%. So I think it's still consistent. We did have some diesel tailwinds in Q1 that's going to fade as the year goes on. But I think on an overall basis, I think 7% is still the right number. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from Truist. \nKeith Hughes: I just want to go back to the organic unit expectation for the year. I'm a little surprised at some of your comments, given that usually this weather gets pushed, whether shortfall gets pushed forward. And with the highway money coming in, is the non-res offset that big? If you could just talk a little more about that. \nC. Nye: I think the overall private offset is what we're more focused on. I think we believe the heavy side of non-res will continue to be attractive, Keith. I think we believe that we're going to see a continued build in public throughout the year with momentum going into next year. I think if we're seeing degrees of softness, and we are, it's going to be in the like non-res and the res. And of course, single-family res is about 2 to 3x more aggregates-intensive than multifamily is. So I think as we're just looking at it through those lenses with longer, higher interest rates. And frankly, degrees of share that we're properly giving up and have given up with respect to our value-over-volume philosophy. I think as we're looking at those things together, that leads us to the conclusion that I've offered to you relative to the organic overall volume on aggregates. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. \nPhilip Ng: Appreciating Texas Cement a little smaller now for the divestiture. While it was obviously a little wet to start the year. So just curious, how is the April Texas demand increase coming along? You guys are obviously ramping up grinding capacity from Midlothian. Have you locked up some of that business? Any risk it puts on perhaps pricing in the back half? And does the market, in your view, support potentially a midyear for Texas Cement. I like to see where you guys are situated? \nC. Nye: Well, thanks for the question. So several things. One, if we're looking at ASP, really looking at it on mix adjusted, it was up like 8.7%. So I mean number one, that's a pretty good number, taking into account a lot of things happened in April. The other thing that I will tell you is we have not given up the goes on the prospect of a price increase in September as well. So no, we continue to see North Texas being very healthy. We continue to see the pricing environment there, very good. And keep in mind, we've got a big internal customer there of our own as well. And we treat our own business just like we treat other customers in that marketplace.\n So again, we feel like that's going to be pretty attractive. The other piece of it that fits together, and I think this is what we're saying as we look at it, Equally, if we look at ASPs in ready mix, I mean, they were up 9% versus the prior year quarter. So again, the ready-mix business, despite the fact that we had significant weather headwinds in the Southwest, we actually had nice weather or nicer weather in Arizona. And if we look at the overall gross profit for ready mix for the quarter, quarter-over-quarter, it was actually nicely up. And again, I read that through for you, Phil, because I think that's a good indicator of what's happening in cement as well. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. \nBrent Thielman: Ward, what inning or quarter or however you'd like to describe do you think you're in with respect to the legacy Heidelberg assets, essentially the California business I'm thinking in particular just around the pricing optimization strategy. And could we infer sort of a similar time line for what you plan to implement in AFS and BWI? \nC. Nye: Brent, thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, I still think we're in relatively early innings in California. I mean that's still a business that if we look at the overall average selling price, it's below our corporate average. You can't say that about many things in California. So I think that's a piece of it. I think the other thing that we're focused on is continuing to grow our business in aggregates in that state. And I think as we continue to do that, that business will mature. That business will become more profitable. Our team will become more seasoned. And that business from the perspective of what does it look like from a percentage of profit look like -- it looks like a lot of the rest of Martin Marietta. So I would think we're in relatively early innings there.\n If we think about the Frei business and the Blue Water businesses, yes look, I mean, they're clearly below a Martin Marietta average. We're already talking obviously about mid-years in the Blue Water transactions. Those are also more home markets for us. I mean that's -- those are Southeastern markets and markets that we know well. I'm not sure what the rate and pace of those businesses will look like compared to California. But my guess is they will likely run in parallel, maybe modestly ahead. That would be the way I would think about it, Brent. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. \nMichael Dudas: I want to come back to your comment on data centers. Relative to some of the other heavy res, non-res markets seems a little bit more in the presentation as well, bit more cautious. Is that a reflection of just the fact of power siting issues, lumpiness in where these data centers are going to be in the areas that you participate? It's just a little -- is it just there's so much demand there? It just needs to be a kind of a sorting out of this opportunity? I just want to get a sense from your standpoint being a large vendor in the early stage of it. \nC. Nye: Yes, I would say several things about it. Number one, there was a really good piece in the Wall Street Journal about 10 days ago, talking about how prolific these data centers will be and talking to a degree about what some of the roadblocks we've had in getting them in and they're multifold. One is land. I mean what's available to is degrees of energy. And I think one reason we feel particularly good about that is the presence that we have in the central part of the United States. So as I'm sitting here today, there are 4 data centers under construction today in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. I mean that -- and those are actually really important markets for us.\n So again, as we're looking at the long-term secular e-commerce, cloud, AI trends but importantly, the where on that, I think that's where we get to advantage Martin Marietta because are we going to have more of that in the Southeast? Yes. Is land use going to be a bit more complicated here? Yes. Will they need more in Texas and the Southwest? Yes. And will land use people, water, et cetera, be a bit more complicated? Yes. But again, as we're looking in the Central United States today, where we have a very significant presence and a very attractive business, I think, in the near term, meaning '24, part of early '25. I think that's where we'll see it. And I think that's going to be our differentiator. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis. \nAdam Thalhimer: Ward, can you comment on the value over volume strategy? Kind of why is that sticking with us here? And any additional color on why we're dealing with that issue? \nC. Nye: I guess one thing that I would say is, frankly, I think our products have been underpriced for a long time. And there's no heavy side building activity that takes place without our product. And we're 10% of the cost of building a road. We're 2% of the cost of building a home and some part between those 2 numbers on a non-res project. but we're also mining and putting something on the ground that takes a lot of skill to do it well and to do it safely. And from our perspective, making sure we're getting good value for the product is really important. And if you look at the quarter that just ended, if ever there was a quarter that revealed why value over volume is so important, this has been it, right? I mean you're looking at ASPs up over 12%, you're looking at volume down 12%.\n But here's what you and I know. The pricing is going to stick and the volume is going to come back. And when those 2 things happen, what you have is a margin expansion show that's really quite impressive. So if we look at the overall difficulties of doing our business, the overall difficulties of getting into our business and the degree of work that we have to go through to put a quality specification product on the ground safely. I think talking to our teams about value is an important conversation for us to have. And from a customer perspective, what we've largely seen is if they have enough time to work those numbers into their bid, it tends to work relatively well from their perspective as well.\n So look, as we've said before, I think if we're in a world that we're looking at pricing the way it was looked at in our company here 4 or 5 years ago, going forward, something has gone wrong at that point. I just -- I believe we're in a different period of time, a different economic cycle and a different way of thinking about value of our product in the ground and in the stockpile. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. \nDavid S. MacGregor: Ward, congratulations on all the progress on the portfolio management, very impressive. \nC. Nye: David, thank you so much. You've watched it a long time. So you've been able to see it. \nDavid S. MacGregor: Yes. Well, it's still going. It sounds like it still has more to go. I wanted to just ask you about the weather impact in the first quarter and how that may have complicated price realizations on your beginning of the year pricing. I know you kind of touched this in response to a previous question, but I may want to come at this at a slightly different angle. Can you just talk about the variance that you're seeing on kind of an MSA to MSA basis across your footprint? in terms of traction on this price increase?\n And also from a weather standpoint, given that maybe some of this is getting pushed out a little bit, does it leave you maybe looking at some ASP pressure temporarily in 2Q before you're able to get greater footing on those price actions in 3Q and beyond? \nC. Nye: David, thanks for the question. I would say several things. You know what, to the last part of your question first, I don't think it puts a degree of 2Q pressure on that. And again, we think we're going to see degrees of midyears even beyond what we've already built into the guide right now. What I would say relative to the weather, it was really more of a Southwest issue than anything else because there was so much rain in Texas and it was so considerably different year-over-year. We did see degrees of deferrals in some places in Texas from January 1 to April 1. And that was part of the conversation that I was having a bit earlier relative to cement in particular. So I do think the weather in that unique circumstance played a bit of a role.\n But again, keep in mind, a lot of the country was accustomed to seeing April 1 pricing. So this notion of pushing everything to January 1 was really something that we've introduced with our customer base here over the last, let's call it, 18 months to 24 months anyway. So I think if I'm looking at whether, how it affected pricing, I think that was it. I think it was relatively discrete I don't think it puts any degree of undue pressure on what we'll see here in the second quarter or for the balance of the year. And I do think it's one of the reasons, again, that we're going to be at least looking at the prospect of some September price increases in cement because it was a little bit slower coming out of the gate in January. David, does that help? \nDavid S. MacGregor: Yes, it does. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. \nTimna Tanners: I wanted to ask about the data center commentary with regard to the 800,000 tons. Is that normal for a data center? Or is that, that particular Google one you mentioned? And also how do we compare that with the footprint of a warehouse because I've heard some comparison there. Just wondering like size-wise, how they compare against one another. And I think there was an earlier question about maybe your caution there, but it is in your presentation is something you're more cautious on. So I just want to make sure we understand that. \nC. Nye: Yes. Good question, Timna. Look, I don't look at that and think of that as being anywhere outside of a normal fairway on what you'd expect on that type of a large commercial project in that type of space. So do I think that's pretty consistent with degrees of other large warehousing? Yes, I think it probably is because if you think about it, Timna, several things are happening. One, they're doing the normal site work that's going to take a good dealer base. At some point, they're putting in the floors that would typically be concrete. At some point, too, they're going to build the walls. And keep in mind, this isn't typically an exercise in aesthetics. In other words, it's not going to be brick. It's not going to be other things that are painted for beauty. In large measure, although I'm not saying there's not beauty in concrete walls. In large measure, these will be concrete tilt-up walls.\n And then the last piece of it, it goes back to some of the conversation I had earlier, Oftentimes, you'll see TPO roofing on these. And I referenced relative to the question on a read-through in Mag, was there anything that could pull through, I think this is an example of that. So no, 800,000 tons isn't unusual. Two, I think it's about in the middle of the fairway. Three, that what the typical build looks like at one of these.\n And as you know, for us, in many respects, it's all about location. And the point I was referencing there in particular, we're the largest underground miner in aggregates in the United States. And when we get in the central part of the United States, in particular, we're able to use our underground mine locations to actually be closer to market centers than we would be able to if we were mining in open pit locations. And what that means is this, for somebody that we're talking about is one that is literally almost above us. So from a proximity perspective, Timna, that actually works very well. \nTimna Tanners: That's helpful color. I like the beauty in concrete. \nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A portion for today's call. I would like to turn it back to Ward Nye for closing remarks. \nC. Nye: Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. In summary, we believe our commitment to world-class safety, commercial and operational excellence and sustainable business practices position us to provide compelling results for the foreseeable future. Thanks to our best-in-class teams, a differentiated business model, well-defined strategic plan and unrivaled growth opportunities, Martin Marietta is well positioned to continue driving sustainable growth and superior shareholder value as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company.\n We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2024 results in the summer. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta. \nOperator: Thank you, presenters. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "C. Nye",
            "content": "Thank you, Jacklyn, and welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta's continued growth and results demonstrate our industry-leading performance and disciplined adherence to and execution of our proven strategic operating analysis and review or store plan.  \n With the nadir, that is always the industry's first quarter concluded in the 2024 construction season meaningfully underway, we remain confident that steady product demand supporting favorable commercial dynamics continued adherence to our value over volume strategy, ongoing operational excellence undertakings and portfolio optimizing transactions will position Martin Marietta for continued outperformance in 2024 and beyond.\n As detailed in today's earnings release, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range to $2.30 billion to $2.44 billion or $2.37 billion at the midpoint. This increase reflects the benefits that will be realized from the recently acquired Blue Water operations as well as strong realization of this year's pricing actions. As is customary, we'll revisit our guidance again at midyear.\n Consistent with our SOAR 2025 initiatives, we've executed $4.5 billion of portfolio-enhancing transactions this year, reducing cyclical downstream exposure while redeploying the proceeds to expand our aggregates footprint and improve our ability to generate consistently higher margins. More specifically, on January 12, we completed the acquisition of Albert Frei & Sons, a leading aggregates producer in Colorado, strengthening our aggregates platform in the high-growth Denver metropolitan area.\n And on April 5, we acquired 20 aggregate operations from Blue Water Industries providing us a new growth platform in Tennessee and Florida. These 2 pure-play aggregates transactions are expected to add approximately 17 million tons of annual shipments and generate approximately $180 million of annualized EBITDA, more than offsetting the EBITDA from the February 9 divestiture of the company's South Texas Cement and related concrete business. These transactions are all reflected in our revised adjusted EBITDA guidance as of their respective closing dates.\n Turning now to the company's first quarter operating performance. Aggregates pricing fundamentals remain attractive, increasing 12.2% or 12.7% on an organic mix adjusted basis, underscoring the advantages of our value over volume commercial strategy, and our sales team's unwavering commitment to receiving appropriate commercial consideration for our valuable and long-lived reserves. Aggregate shipments declined 12.3% due largely to the well chronic cold weather impacted start to the year in our East and Southwest divisions and softening demand in warehouse, office and retail construction partially offset by more favorable weather and relative strength in our Central and West divisions. Aggregates product line gross profit per ton increased 14% and gross margin expanded by 90 basis points notwithstanding the shipment decline.\n Looking ahead, we remain enthusiastic about Martin Marietta's attractive market fundamentals and long-term secular trends across our 3 primary end uses of Public Works, nonresidential and residential construction. More specifically, we believe these markets in Martin Marietta's chosen geographies will drive aggregates intensive growth and favorable pricing trends for the foreseeable future. We expect robust multiyear demand in public infrastructure, U.S.-based manufacturing, energy projects and data center construction will partially offset near-term softness in warehouse, light nonresidential and residential end markets. That said, we fully expect the housing recovery, particularly in single-family once affordability challenges subside as demand in our key markets remains robust.\n Infrastructure activity is expected to continue to grow in 2024 as early Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA projects advance to the major construction phase. Notably, according to the annual market outlook provided by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association or ARPA, public highway, batement and street construction, the largest market sector is expected to increase 16% to $126 billion in 2024 as compared with $109 billion in 2023 as record State Department of Transportation or DOT budgets, match federal funds and provide additional investments.\n The value of state and local government highway, bridge and tunnel contract awards, a leading indicator for our future product demand grew 11% to $116 billion for the 12-month period ending February 29, 2024. This generational investment in our nation's infrastructure supported by federal, state and local actions provides state DOTs with certainty to advance projects in their backlogs, driving sustained multiyear demand in this aggregate intensive often countercyclical market.\n Shifting to the heavy nonresidential market, manufacturing projects continue to be supported by steady demand from ongoing reshoring of critical product supply chains, Construction spending for domestic manufacturing continues to trend positively with the February ceasing adjusted annual rate of spending for 2024 a $223 billion, a 32% increase from the February 2023 value of $169 billion. Equally, we expect the long-term secular trends towards cloud-based services and artificial intelligence will drive renewed growth in data center construction, which had moderated from a post-COVID peak.\n As an example, in March, Google announced a new $1 billion data center in Kansas City to help drive its artificial intelligence efforts, which requires nearly 800,000 tons of aggregates from our uniquely positioned underground operations.\n Looking at the light nonresidential market, we expect 2024 demand will be challenged given higher for longer interest rates, high office vacancy rates and the natural construction lag from the last 2 years of single-family residential declines. As for the residential market, despite near-term uncertainty around mortgage rates, we're encouraged by positive trends in single-family housing starts, a leading indicator of aggregates demand, which were 1 million units in March 2024, a nearly 21% increase from a year ago.\n Notably, single-family housing starts have been at or above 1 million units since November 2023, indicative of a recovery from the 2023 trough. Given the well-publicized structural housing deficit in our company's key metropolitan areas, we expect Martin Marietta to benefit disproportionately from new home construction once interest rates moderate and monthly mortgage payments become more affordable.\n I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter financial results. Jim? Jim, thanks so much. To conclude, we expect 2024 will be another year of significant achievement for Martin Marietta. We're well positioned to benefit from infrastructure tailwinds, providing steady product demand and favorable commercial dynamics across our coast-to-coast footprint. Over the past 30 years, since the public company, Martin Marietta has built a resilient and durable business. We'll continue to build on the foundation that has proven so successful an aggregates-led platform with an unwavering commitment to safety, commercial and operational excellence and the disciplined execution of our strategic priorities.\n If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions. Thank you. You do have it right. And thanks for the questions. I'll try to do with all 3 parts. So let's talk first about integration, and your question is a good one. And look, you've -- we closed on Frei. We closed on Blue Water. The transactions went well. And the nice thing from our perspective, one, our teams have done this and done a lot and done it well. Number two, we typically close on a Friday, and we open up on Monday morning and it's a Martin Marietta operation. It has our signs, it has our tickets, they're on our networks, and that's exactly what we've seen. So again, the blocking, the tackling and the people integration is complete, and it's exactly where you would expect it to be based on our history.\n Now from a commercial excellence and operational excellence integration perspective, a couple of views on that. If we're looking at the commercial excellence, I mean, given the fact that we closed on Blue Water relatively quickly, number one, we were able to announce midyears in all of those markets effective July 15. And we generally ought to provide people with at least 90 days of notice to our customers. So again, the early closing of Blue Water worked to our advantage in that respect.\n With regard to operational excellence, several things that I think are worth noting, look, we look for quick wins. We're looking for suppliers. We're looking to spend more on favorable contracts that typically happens within the first 90 days without any incremental CapEx, we're seeing that. Longer term, we're obviously going to be looking at plant upgrades. We're looking at fleet modernization. And that typically takes some time, and it's got a CapEx component. And actually, one of the things that you'll see in the guidance is CapEx is up modestly, and that's up modestly because of things just like that in addition to what we feel like could be some opportunistic land purchases later.\n One thing relative to BWI in particular, keep in mind that was a carve-out. So no corporate SG&A came with that business. So it was already basically synergized from that perspective. So again, all of that has actually gone very nicely, Trey. The other piece of it that you mentioned, and you're right on if we're looking overall at volume, you remember when we came out at the year, not taking these transactions into account, we said we thought minus 2% to plus 2%. Midpoint was 0. What we're seeing now because of interest longer, really a bit of a weather-impacted start to the year.\n And the fact is if we look at 5 million tons down in Q1, if we parse that, several things worth noting. One, there were 3 less shipping days in this quarter than there were last year. That's probably about let's call that a couple of million tons by itself. But if we're looking then at the balance, which is quite about 3 million tons really, Trey. I mean about 1/3 of that was slower private, about 1/3 of that was weather, and about 1/3 of that is value over volume.\n So again, when we're taking those components into account, and we're looking at organic or heritage volume, but we think we're probably closer to the lower end of that original guide, let's call it down 2%, down 3%. And then what you're seeing in the new guide, takes the acquisitions effect into account. So hopefully, that gives you the bridge that you wanted, Trey. So I'll try to go through the integration components of it and then deal also with the volume bridge. Was there a piece of your question I did not respond to yet? No, we are. So if you look at the overall EBITDA midpoint, it's now $2.37 billion. Now that's 11% over where we were last year. So take that into account that basically, we're going to give you a year's worth of Blue Water in only 9 months. So that's one way to think of it. But the other thing that's important to state is we're also seeing improvement in the Heritage business as well. So we're getting a 2 for there. We're getting the benefit of Blue Water, by the way, which we think there's going to be more to come. We're also seeing improvement in the Heritage business you can see, among other things, we raised the aggregate pricing to 12% at the midpoint.\n So again, that's going to include some degree of midyear this year. And keeping in mind some of the difficulty that we have is if we're looking at pricing that was at Frei and pricing that was at Blue Water, their pricing was actually below Heritage Martin Marietta pricing. So the pricing that you're seeing and the changes that you're seeing are despite the overall headwind that we actually have from the new businesses that we brought in, Trey. So I hope that helps relative to the EBITDA range and what we're doing relative to pricing as well. Thank you, Kathryn. So a couple of things. One, if we're looking at the pricing guide that we've given for the rest of the year, I mean here's the direct answer. It's got some mid years. It doesn't have everything that we believe we're going to see. So what does that mean? It means that now that we bought Blue Water, we've already indicated to those customers, they're going to get midyears. So we've built that in. As you may recall, coming into the year, we had indicated that we had not put it in guidance. We had already indicated to our customers in California that they were going to get midyears, that has been worked on.\n So there have been some very specific midyears that have been worked into the numbers that you see. So the numbers that you're seeing reflect 2 things: some very direct midyears, very nice realization of the beginning year increases that we put in. But the fact is, we still think we're going to see some more mid-years at midyear. So what that tells you is you should expect us to come back with more color on what that looks like. when we're reporting during the summertime. So that's the way I would ask you to think about that.\n Now relative to Mag Specialties, I would say several things. Number one, the chemical markets globally are still very difficult markets. Now that said, Mag just had its best quarter ever. So I'd say a couple of things are worth reading through on that. Number one is steel doing relatively well. It is. Is it blowing the doors off? It's not. So it tells us that business is actually performing quite well. So steel utilization is about at 72%. So if we're looking at the way that business is overall going, I'm actually very pleased with it.\n I think a read-through that you may be looking at is this. One of the things that we're seeing begin to recover nicely is TPO roofing. And that tells us now as we're looking at degrees of manufacturing and that manufacturing renaissance that we can look for across the United States that TPO roofing is what we're going to see in a lot of these data centers and a lot of these new battery plants and others. So typically, we're watching those products go into larger industrial uses. But when we're seeing TPO roofing recover, -- if you're looking for that read through, Kathryn, I don't think that's a bad read through. Stanley, thank you for the question. Happy to do so. I mean, look, let's start with infrastructure, which is our single largest end use and an end use that we think is going to get nicely larger. Look, we see that up mid-single to high single digits this year for several reasons. One, you've got the bipartisan infrastructure law that's going to be coming in, in a meaningful way this year. Build into '25 even more meaningfully. So we see that working in a very significant way in a multi-year fashion. Keep in mind, too, we've got very healthy DOTs in our chosen geographies.\n If we're looking at our top 10 states, those budgets are up around 10% year-over-year. And last year, keep in mind, those budgets were pretty attractive. I mentioned in my prepared comments that if we're looking at the last 12 months highway, bridge and tunnel awards, those were up 12%. That's $116 billion versus $104 billion during the prior period. And the other thing that I think people forget is what's happening at local levels relative to ballot initiatives and what we saw last year were about $7 billion of transportation funding approved in 2023 that we'll see in the marketplace this year. So again, we think infrastructure looks attractive.\n If we're looking at non-res, our view is still largely the same. We think that's down probably mid-single digits, perhaps a little bit more. Keep in mind, of the portion of our business that is non-res. Around 55% of it is heavy non-res and about 45% of it is light non-res. And by the way, we think that's a pretty good break and we like the way that looks. Now if we're thinking about heavy, several things that worth keeping in mind. One, we put in the supplemental slides the fact that there's $53 billion worth of CHIPS Act money and about $250 billion of Inflation Reduction Act money that will be flowing through those sectors over the next several years. But what we're seeing more specifically is demand for heavy side energy and domestic manufacturing. That continues to be really resilient. And we think that's offsetting moderation in degrees of distribution and warehousing.\n Now where we are seeing some green shoots, and I think this is important, is in AI and in data centers. So for example, I mentioned Google is building a new facility in Kansas City. It's going to take about 800,000 tons but it's not just there. I mean, we're seeing it across the Midwest. We're seeing it in Omaha. We're seeing it in Des Moines. And we're going to be a disproportionate beneficiary of that due to the availability of land and wind power in those states where we actually have a very significant interest.\n Now light non-res is, in fact, in our view, going to be impacted near term by the high interest rates for longer and office vacancy rates. And I think that partly goes back to the commentary that I was having with Trey relative to what we see going on with organic volume. So that's certainly a piece of it. And resi, we see that down, let's call it, low single digits, maybe modestly higher than that. We think softness will persist there as we continue navigating this period of higher mortgage rates that's impacting affordability. I think clearly, people are thinking today that mortgage rates are going to remain higher than they would have thought in February. And I think that's part of the reality of it.\n But I do like the recent trends. I mean if we're looking at recent trends in single-family housing starts are encouraging because since last November, the starts have been at 1 million units, and that's a nearly 21% year-over-year increase, and we know the demand is going to have to be met with new construction. And again, if you take a look at the states with big population inflows I mean think about these states and think about Martin Marietta Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, et cetera. So far we think near-term single-family housing is going to be a modest headwind, we think long term, it's going to be really very attractive.\n So our view is if we look at infrastructure and think about how that's going to build multiyear, we look at res, think about how that's going to build multiyear look at the heavy side of non-res, we think that's going to continue to be very resilient. And we think the light nonres is going to come behind res most likely with that 6- to 9-month lag. So Stanley, I hope that helps. I'd say several things. Number one, we are an aggregates-led company, and we've always told people that's what you should expect us to be. And the moves that we have made are totally consistent with that. So should you expect to see aggregates number go up largely because I think we'll be buying relatively aggregates pure businesses? I think the answer to that question is yes.\n Equally though, if we pivot and talk about the other 2 businesses that you spoke up, remember, we've long spoken of the criticality of strategic cement. And we've said strategic cement is where we're an aggregates leader where the market is naturally vertically integrated, where we have a significant downstream business, meaning ready-mix concrete, that takes a significant portion of the cement and where it cannot be meaningfully interdicted by water.\n And the fact is that is precisely what Midlothian means to us. And one of the things that you will keep in mind, Anthony, we've got 450,000 tons worth of annual capacity that will be coming on at Midlothian this year in Q3. So we continue to invest in that business because we like that business, and we very much like being in that business in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n Equally, if you look at the Magnesia Specialties business, and keep in mind that's a business that we have about $100 million worth of investment in. That's a business that's going to make over $100 million a year. And frankly, it's a business that if we can find ways to responsibly grow it, they've earned that right because from a margin perspective, that's a hugely attractive business. So the way that we think of it, yes, is it aggregates led, you bet. Are we looking in particular at those 3 big upstream businesses is driving the vast majority of our revenues and profits.\n And the upstream businesses, meaning, number one, aggregates; number two, cement; number three, Mag specialties. So yes, you will see that aggregates percentage go up. And yes, your number was right. I mean we're sitting here today looking at gross profit from aggregates at about 77%. And if we look to where we were a year ago, it was somewhere sub-70%, closer to 69%. So expect that number to keep going up but I hope I've also outlined to you the way that we think about our very important and very good cement business in Dallas-Fort Worth and a high-performing Magnesia Specialties business as well. Thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, we have looked in the markets in which we want to grow and in the markets, most importantly, that we can grow. So we have several things that advantage is. Number one, the condition of our balance sheet. So if you look at our balance sheet, we are in a position that we can grow and we can continue to grow smartly. Number two, if you look at the transactions that we've done, I think you'll look at the transactions and say that we have done those in a wise and prudent fashion.\n If we look at businesses that we want to buy in markets in which we want to enter, by our math, we found businesses that on a per annum basis, produce and sell about 238 million tons of aggregates per annum. Here's the way to capture that. Basically, there's another Martin Marietta that's out there that we believe we have the ability over time to buy. Now can I sit here and tell you from a linear perspective exactly what that's going to look like? No, I can't.\n But can I tell you that I believe, economically, geographically, regulatorily and otherwise that we are uniquely positioned to do that, in my view, better than any other publicly held company in the United States. I believe that we are. And of course, I look at the world through Martin Marietta lenses, but I also believe that's a good clinical view of where we are. Our team is good at that. We're good at identifying businesses. We're good at the contracting phase of it. And as you heard during our earlier comments, we're very good at the integration and synergy phase of it as well. And our shareholders like what we do from M&A.\n So will it continue to be our first call on capital, if we've got the right deal? The answer is it will. So our capital priorities remain the same. The right deal is, #1, investing in the business responsibly is #2, and returning cash to shareholders through a meaningful and sustainable dividend and through share repurchases remains #3. And my guess is those will be our priorities for quite a while. So again, I hope that's responsive to your question. Yes. Thank you for the question. Number one, what I would say is when we go through a transaction and look at what we can do from a synergy perspective on making the operations safer, on making the operations more efficient and making sure that we can bring more products to market. The ability to go through a business and synergize it from those perspectives so it works for our customers is important, and that's precisely what we've been able to do at Blue Water, and that's what we're doing right now at Albert Frei. And through that type of process that we have, we can take what might otherwise look like a relatively high multiple. And by the time we're done with it, bring it to a multiple that you look at, and I look at our shareholders look at and feel like that's a very attractive model.\n Our view is that's the way that we're going to continue growing our business. Now from a land use and planning perspective, look, we're good at that, too. We're good at identifying property. We're got going through the zoning, we're going to going through special use permitting. But frankly, you're going to see more of that adjacent to ongoing operations than you will from a greenfield perspective. And one reason I feel that way. Look, I think 4 years is a pretty heady time frame to think about a greenfield operation. I think a more realistic time frame is probably 7 to 10 years. And if we think about the difference in cash flow, getting a meaningful profit in buying a business today as opposed to greenfielding, we think that's a more constructive way to do it.\n The other thing to keep in mind is we're an awfully long way away from being anywhere near peak volumes in our business. So we're looking at reserves in the ground today that are nearly 70 years at current extraction rates. So our need to go out and put in greenfield locations is not terribly high. Our need in some instances, for example, in California and what we did in Colorado years ago in buying adjacent properties, bulking up what looks like a 30-year reserve position in California, it's something that's going to be a lot longer. We think that's a very sensible way to go through land purchase.\n And you heard me speak earlier in our CapEx number we're looking at some opportunistic land purchases. But I would expect us to do M&A, I would expect us to do within multiples that to us, and I believe to you, will look quite reasonable, and I would look for us not to do so much greenfielding but to be more focused in our heritage business and adding reserves to existing locations. I think the overall private offset is what we're more focused on. I think we believe the heavy side of non-res will continue to be attractive, Keith. I think we believe that we're going to see a continued build in public throughout the year with momentum going into next year. I think if we're seeing degrees of softness, and we are, it's going to be in the like non-res and the res. And of course, single-family res is about 2 to 3x more aggregates-intensive than multifamily is. So I think as we're just looking at it through those lenses with longer, higher interest rates. And frankly, degrees of share that we're properly giving up and have given up with respect to our value-over-volume philosophy. I think as we're looking at those things together, that leads us to the conclusion that I've offered to you relative to the organic overall volume on aggregates. Well, thanks for the question. So several things. One, if we're looking at ASP, really looking at it on mix adjusted, it was up like 8.7%. So I mean number one, that's a pretty good number, taking into account a lot of things happened in April. The other thing that I will tell you is we have not given up the goes on the prospect of a price increase in September as well. So no, we continue to see North Texas being very healthy. We continue to see the pricing environment there, very good. And keep in mind, we've got a big internal customer there of our own as well. And we treat our own business just like we treat other customers in that marketplace.\n So again, we feel like that's going to be pretty attractive. The other piece of it that fits together, and I think this is what we're saying as we look at it, Equally, if we look at ASPs in ready mix, I mean, they were up 9% versus the prior year quarter. So again, the ready-mix business, despite the fact that we had significant weather headwinds in the Southwest, we actually had nice weather or nicer weather in Arizona. And if we look at the overall gross profit for ready mix for the quarter, quarter-over-quarter, it was actually nicely up. And again, I read that through for you, Phil, because I think that's a good indicator of what's happening in cement as well. Brent, thank you for the question. I would say several things. One, I still think we're in relatively early innings in California. I mean that's still a business that if we look at the overall average selling price, it's below our corporate average. You can't say that about many things in California. So I think that's a piece of it. I think the other thing that we're focused on is continuing to grow our business in aggregates in that state. And I think as we continue to do that, that business will mature. That business will become more profitable. Our team will become more seasoned. And that business from the perspective of what does it look like from a percentage of profit look like -- it looks like a lot of the rest of Martin Marietta. So I would think we're in relatively early innings there.\n If we think about the Frei business and the Blue Water businesses, yes look, I mean, they're clearly below a Martin Marietta average. We're already talking obviously about mid-years in the Blue Water transactions. Those are also more home markets for us. I mean that's -- those are Southeastern markets and markets that we know well. I'm not sure what the rate and pace of those businesses will look like compared to California. But my guess is they will likely run in parallel, maybe modestly ahead. That would be the way I would think about it, Brent. Yes, I would say several things about it. Number one, there was a really good piece in the Wall Street Journal about 10 days ago, talking about how prolific these data centers will be and talking to a degree about what some of the roadblocks we've had in getting them in and they're multifold. One is land. I mean what's available to is degrees of energy. And I think one reason we feel particularly good about that is the presence that we have in the central part of the United States. So as I'm sitting here today, there are 4 data centers under construction today in Eastern Nebraska and Western Iowa. I mean that -- and those are actually really important markets for us.\n So again, as we're looking at the long-term secular e-commerce, cloud, AI trends but importantly, the where on that, I think that's where we get to advantage Martin Marietta because are we going to have more of that in the Southeast? Yes. Is land use going to be a bit more complicated here? Yes. Will they need more in Texas and the Southwest? Yes. And will land use people, water, et cetera, be a bit more complicated? Yes. But again, as we're looking in the Central United States today, where we have a very significant presence and a very attractive business, I think, in the near term, meaning '24, part of early '25. I think that's where we'll see it. And I think that's going to be our differentiator. I guess one thing that I would say is, frankly, I think our products have been underpriced for a long time. And there's no heavy side building activity that takes place without our product. And we're 10% of the cost of building a road. We're 2% of the cost of building a home and some part between those 2 numbers on a non-res project. but we're also mining and putting something on the ground that takes a lot of skill to do it well and to do it safely. And from our perspective, making sure we're getting good value for the product is really important. And if you look at the quarter that just ended, if ever there was a quarter that revealed why value over volume is so important, this has been it, right? I mean you're looking at ASPs up over 12%, you're looking at volume down 12%.\n But here's what you and I know. The pricing is going to stick and the volume is going to come back. And when those 2 things happen, what you have is a margin expansion show that's really quite impressive. So if we look at the overall difficulties of doing our business, the overall difficulties of getting into our business and the degree of work that we have to go through to put a quality specification product on the ground safely. I think talking to our teams about value is an important conversation for us to have. And from a customer perspective, what we've largely seen is if they have enough time to work those numbers into their bid, it tends to work relatively well from their perspective as well.\n So look, as we've said before, I think if we're in a world that we're looking at pricing the way it was looked at in our company here 4 or 5 years ago, going forward, something has gone wrong at that point. I just -- I believe we're in a different period of time, a different economic cycle and a different way of thinking about value of our product in the ground and in the stockpile. David, thank you so much. You've watched it a long time. So you've been able to see it. David, thanks for the question. I would say several things. You know what, to the last part of your question first, I don't think it puts a degree of 2Q pressure on that. And again, we think we're going to see degrees of midyears even beyond what we've already built into the guide right now. What I would say relative to the weather, it was really more of a Southwest issue than anything else because there was so much rain in Texas and it was so considerably different year-over-year. We did see degrees of deferrals in some places in Texas from January 1 to April 1. And that was part of the conversation that I was having a bit earlier relative to cement in particular. So I do think the weather in that unique circumstance played a bit of a role.\n But again, keep in mind, a lot of the country was accustomed to seeing April 1 pricing. So this notion of pushing everything to January 1 was really something that we've introduced with our customer base here over the last, let's call it, 18 months to 24 months anyway. So I think if I'm looking at whether, how it affected pricing, I think that was it. I think it was relatively discrete I don't think it puts any degree of undue pressure on what we'll see here in the second quarter or for the balance of the year. And I do think it's one of the reasons, again, that we're going to be at least looking at the prospect of some September price increases in cement because it was a little bit slower coming out of the gate in January. David, does that help? Yes. Good question, Timna. Look, I don't look at that and think of that as being anywhere outside of a normal fairway on what you'd expect on that type of a large commercial project in that type of space. So do I think that's pretty consistent with degrees of other large warehousing? Yes, I think it probably is because if you think about it, Timna, several things are happening. One, they're doing the normal site work that's going to take a good dealer base. At some point, they're putting in the floors that would typically be concrete. At some point, too, they're going to build the walls. And keep in mind, this isn't typically an exercise in aesthetics. In other words, it's not going to be brick. It's not going to be other things that are painted for beauty. In large measure, although I'm not saying there's not beauty in concrete walls. In large measure, these will be concrete tilt-up walls.\n And then the last piece of it, it goes back to some of the conversation I had earlier, Oftentimes, you'll see TPO roofing on these. And I referenced relative to the question on a read-through in Mag, was there anything that could pull through, I think this is an example of that. So no, 800,000 tons isn't unusual. Two, I think it's about in the middle of the fairway. Three, that what the typical build looks like at one of these.\n And as you know, for us, in many respects, it's all about location. And the point I was referencing there in particular, we're the largest underground miner in aggregates in the United States. And when we get in the central part of the United States, in particular, we're able to use our underground mine locations to actually be closer to market centers than we would be able to if we were mining in open pit locations. And what that means is this, for somebody that we're talking about is one that is literally almost above us. So from a proximity perspective, Timna, that actually works very well. Thank you all for joining today's earnings conference call. In summary, we believe our commitment to world-class safety, commercial and operational excellence and sustainable business practices position us to provide compelling results for the foreseeable future. Thanks to our best-in-class teams, a differentiated business model, well-defined strategic plan and unrivaled growth opportunities, Martin Marietta is well positioned to continue driving sustainable growth and superior shareholder value as we build and maintain the world's safest, best-performing and most durable aggregates-led public company.\n We look forward to sharing our second quarter 2024 results in the summer. As always, we're available for any follow-up questions. Thank you again for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta."

            "name": "James Nickolas",
            "content": "Thanks, Ward, and good morning, everyone. As Ward mentioned and indicated in our earnings release, we raised our full year 2024 adjusted EBIT guidance to $2.37 billion at the midpoint and our full year 2024 aggregates gross profit guidance to $1.75 billion at the midpoint. The updated guidance for Aggregates gross profit includes a $30 million nonrecurring noncash purchase accounting impact expected in the second quarter the fair market value write-up of inventory related to the Blue Water acquisition.\n The Building Materials business generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 8% and gross profit of $248 million, a decrease of 10%. The vast majority of the decline in both metrics is due to the effect of our divestiture of our South Texas cement and ready-mix business. A much smaller portion of the decline was due to shipments impacted by tougher weather this quarter compared to the prior year's unseasonably favorable weather conditions. Despite the lower shipment volumes, Aggregates gross profit increased modestly to $239 million, and gross margin increased 90 basis points to 27%. These results reflect our team's focus on what we can control specifically the efficacy of our commercial discipline and flexible cost structure, which drives higher profits without the benefit of growing volumes.\n Turning to our Texas cement and targeted downstream businesses. Our Cement and Concrete revenues decreased 22% to $265 million and gross profit decreased 47% to $31 million, driven primarily by the divestiture of our South Texas cement plant and its related concrete operations and secondarily by wet weather in Texas. Additionally, the new finish mill at our Midlothian cement plant in North Texas, which will add approximately 450,000 tons of incremental high-margin annual production capacity is still on track to be operational in the third quarter of 2024. Consistent with typical seasonal trends in relevant geographies, the asphalt and paving business posted a $22 million gross loss as our Minnesota-based asphalt facilities are inactive during the first quarter due to winter operational shutdowns and our Colorado-based operations experienced unfavorable winter conditions.\n Magnesia Specialties achieved an all-time quarterly gross profit record of $29 million despite a 3% decrease in revenues to $81 million as strong pricing, improved maintenance cost control and energy tailwinds more than offset continued headwinds in metal mining end markets. Our long-standing disciplined capital allocation priorities remain focused on responsibly growing our business through value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the consistent return of capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile. In the first quarter, we invested $200 million of capital into our business. We also returned to shareholders almost $200 million during the quarter with $150 million of that used to repurchase over 255,000 shares at an average price of $586.85.\n Since our repurchase authorization announcement in February 2015, we have returned a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x as of March 31. Assuming no further M&A activity, we expect net leverage to be 1.4x by year-end below our targeted range of 2.0 to 2.5x providing a strong balance sheet to capitalize on a robust acquisition pipeline. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ward. Yes. Garik, Jim here. I think I indicated at the last quarter's call about 7% COGS per ton inflation. I think that's still accurate for the full year. I would say that inflation rate will be higher in the first half of the year and lower in the back half of the year, but a blended average of 7%. So I think it's still consistent. We did have some diesel tailwinds in Q1 that's going to fade as the year goes on. But I think on an overall basis, I think 7% is still the right number."
