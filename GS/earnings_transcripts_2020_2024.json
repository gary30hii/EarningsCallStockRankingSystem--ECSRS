I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 19, 2021. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.\nHeather Kennedy Miner: Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference both our strategic update and the earnings presentations, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in both presentations. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. This morning we are pleased to review the firm's fourth quarter and full year performance in addition to providing an update on the strategic plan we outlined at last year's Investor Day. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I\u2019ll now pass the call over to David. David?\nDavid Solomon: Thanks Heather, and thank you to everybody for joining us this morning. Let me begin with Page 1 of our strategic update presentation. I'm pleased to report that 2020 was a year of strong performance for Goldman Sachs, as we successfully navigated unexpected operating backdrop characterized by near record volatility and correspondingly high client activity. This year was marked by an extraordinary decline in economic activity in the second quarter brought on by COVID-19 and a dramatic reversal in the third and fourth quarter as economic output and unemployment partially reversed course. This volatility contributed to severe dislocation across asset classes, which was met by profound physical and monetary action taken across the globe. Goldman Sachs met the needs of our clients relying on dynamic management of the firm's liquidity and balance sheet to provide complex risk and remediation, financing solutions, advice, and innovative thought leadership. Momentum remains strong into year-end as we produce record revenues for the fourth quarter of $11.7 billion resulting in record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. For the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $44.6 billion, our highest revenue production in more than a decade, which allowed us to generate meaningful operating leverage. We delivered a full year ROE of 11.1%, notwithstanding nearly 4 percentage point impact of litigation expense. This revenue growth was clearly driven by a larger opportunity set given the extraordinary activity throughout 2020. While industry wallet grew, we also took meaningful market share across businesses and geographies. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We maintained our leading global position and completed M&A as we have for 19 of the past 20 years, and strong lead table positions in underwriting, including a number one ranking in equity and equity linked offerings and a top-three ranking in high-yield. We delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities and solid client activity across our global platform, and grew market share across businesses and client groups. Our next-generation trading talent, now in positions of leadership, demonstrated strong risk management discipline and client focus in executing against an expanding opportunity set. In asset management we had record management and other fees as well as continued growth in our assets under supervision. We also generated solid revenues from our balance sheet investments driven by public marks and event driven gains on our portfolio. We continued our broader effort to reduce the balance sheet intensity of this business as we transition to more third-party investing. We continue to provide high quality advice to our wealth management clients producing record revenues and generated strong growth in our consumer business. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet and demonstrated agility in the deployment of capital to serve clients amid high levels of market volatility and evolving regulatory constraints. While we are cautiously optimistic, given improving macro trends, we recognize that the operating backdrop will continue to evolve. Although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the U.S., UK and other nations, there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risk. Let me underscore the progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally. I urge political leaders at all levels and across all jurisdictions to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan. In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed. Economists continue to anticipate a mixed outlook for near-term growth. The expectation is it will take until at least the second quarter to return to pre-pandemic levels of output. Our economists expect GDP growth this year of roughly 6.5% both globally and in the U.S., which would suggest a more rapid recovery. Though circumstances around COVID-19 remained fluid and we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weaknesses in the broader economy, looking ahead the extreme volatility of 2020 is unlikely to repeat given the government actions taken last year. Nevertheless, I am confident that Goldman Sachs will continue to benefit from the established wallet share gains made in 2020 across an expanding client set, particularly in investment banking and global markets and continue to develop more durable revenue sources across asset management and consumer wealth management. With that, let me turn to Page 2. In the 12 months since our Investor Day, we have made steady progress towards our medium-term goals and we remain confident that we will achieve these targets as well as our longer-term goal of mid teens or higher returns. Our 2020 ROE when adjusted to exclude the impact of litigation comfortably exceeds our 13% medium-term target. We are pleased with our progress on funding diversification as we grew deposits by $70 billion in 2020. While the Fed funds rate declined faster than the reduction in our deposit rates, we have since adjusted our pricing, which should allow us to achieve our funding optimization goals by 2022. We are making headway and realizing expense efficiencies throughout the organization and have achieved approximately half of the $1.3 billion initial target we presented at our Investor Day. We will continue to make progress from here and we will evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings. Finally, with respect to capital, our CET1 ratio stands at 14.7%. This positions us well to serve clients and accelerate capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter. We continue to believe that a 13% to 13.5% ratio is appropriate for the firm over the medium-term. We are encouraged by the results of the recent mid-cycle stress test. That said, we will continue to proactively reduce the stress capital intensity of our businesses, including through continued sales of our on balance sheet private equity investments. As John, Stephen and I have emphasized many times, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and being transparent with our stakeholders on our progress. We are tracking roughly 30 firm-wide KPIs and many additional business level metrics on a regular basis to measure our success as we execute on all aspects of our strategy. Let me now turn to Page 3. While last January's Investor Day seems distant given the events of the past year, the pillars of our strategic direction remain unchanged. Our strategy is simple; first, to grow and strengthen our existing franchise and capture higher wallet share across a wider client set; second, to diversify our products and services in order to build a more durable earnings stream, and third to operate more efficiently so that we can drive higher margins and returns across the organization. We are seeing early success in each category. Moving to Page 4, the strength of our firm's culture is the foundation for our performance as individuals in the firm and is central to the success that we achieved in 2020. Delivering the entire firm to our clients through our One Goldman Sachs approach is crucial to our mission and clients remain the center of everything we do. The investments we made to break down internal silos and motivate better collaboration across the firm have been critical and will continue to guide our approach going forward. Equally, core to our mission is delivering on our firm's purpose to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. This purpose is fundamental to our 10-year, $750 billion sustainable finance commitment that cuts across two broad pillars; climate transition and inclusive growth. During the year we have worked closely with our clients to deepen knowledge and expertise, develop capabilities, and accelerate commercial activity. We are delivering integrated ESG solutions across our client base, and I'm proud of the firm's leadership on this topic and optimistic about the benefits that these opportunities will bring to our clients. As we pursue these ambitious goals, we will also continue to focus on our people. Diversity is an imperative for our organization. For Goldman Sachs it is about bringing diverse people, perspectives and abilities together to best serve our stakeholders and fosters more creative thinking and supports the inclusive sustainable growth that is core to our long-term business strategy. While our recent progress is encouraging, including the most diverse campus analyst class ever to join the firm this past summer and improved diversity of our most recent partner and managing director classes, the events of the past year have reinforced how much further we have to go to enhance diversity and inclusion throughout the firm. This remains a personal priority for me and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable to make further advancements, including through our new aspirational goals to drive diverse hiring at more levels of the firm. Let me now take you through each of our four operating segments. I will start with investment banking, where we remain the advisor of choice for corporations around the world and 2020 is measured against the goals set out at our Investor Day, we maintained our number one ranking and announced and completed M&A and equity and equity linked offerings. We also ranked in the top-four for wallet share in global debt underwriting through the third quarter. We spoke last January about our aim to grow share in our core business. We began to execute on this goal in 2020 as announced M&A deal count was up along with our equity underwriting wallet share. On our footprint expansion efforts we have met our Investor Day target for client coverage. We generated in excess of $800 million of revenue in 2020 from this client set and we expect this to be an important source of growth going forward. Across the business we have added approximately 2700 net new clients since 2017 and we will continue to add new clients to sustain this space. We are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for investment banking given the robust activity levels in the capital markets and the elevated strategic activity on the back of improving CO [ph] confidence reflected in our near record backlog at the end of the year. We are also pleased with the early success of our transaction banking platform with which since its launch last June has attracted roughly 225 corporate clients and nearly $30 billion of deposits and is well-positioned to drive growth and more durable revenues for the firm. A combination of our [indiscernible] product offering, strong client receptivity, and tailwinds created by the macroeconomic environment, drove deposit growth ahead of expectations. As we work to deliver greater functionality to clients and continue their on-boarding, we will convert more of these deposits to operation providing increased funding utility to the firm. We also continue to look for innovative ways to expand the reach of our platform to new clients as we did with our recent partnership with Stripe which embeds our transaction banking payment and deposit solutions directly into Stripes' platform, making these products available to its millions of small business customers. Let me now turn to Page 6. In 2020 our global markets business posted its strongest net revenues in a decade, exceeding the return targets laid out for the business at Investor Day. Global markets is a business that many believe should have been downsized when John, Stephen, and I took our seats. While it's only a single year, the performance of the business in 2020 is an early validation of our decision to stay the course. Our teams worked diligently to serve our clients through the challenges of 2020 providing liquidity across asset classes in a mediating risk and engaging instruction solutions, while also supporting significant volumes across expanding digital platforms. We also advanced on our Investor Day objective of moving into a top-three position with more of the top-100 institutional clients. We are now in the top-three across 64 of these firms, up from 51 a year ago. We gained 120 basis points of wallet share through the third quarter of 2020, which we intend to maintain through our deepened client relationships, superior risk intermediation, and ongoing investment in technology platforms. We set a goal in January to increase our client financing activity. A record six financing revenues were 2020 demonstrate our ability to meet this target. Additionally, we continue to strengthen our prime business where we closed the year with record balances, the result of a multiyear investment in platform enhancements and other client oriented initiatives particularly in the Quant space. Finally, while we saw meaningful revenue growth in global markets, we remain focused on operating efficiencies. We achieved roughly $400 million in expense efficiencies last year and allocated $1.25 billion of capital in that business to more accretive opportunities, both ahead of schedule. Across any level of industry wallet, the progress that we have made in global markets has improved. The business is structural return profile. Let me now turn to Page 7. Our asset management business experienced solid performance in 2020 marked by continued growth in assets under supervision driving record management and other fees. Our status as one of the world's leading global asset managers has served us well during this volatile period. Our Asset management business provides clients with offerings across the spectrum, from liquidity to alternatives and we will continue to grow this business opportunistically by serving our clients' needs and differentiating our offerings with holistic advice, investment solutions, and portfolio implementation. We are progressing well towards our longer term objectives of $250 billion of growth in traditional equity and fixed income products and $100 billion of net inflows to alternatives. To that end we spoke at Investor Day about growing our third-party alternatives business and we are pleased with our early achievements. We have raised approximately $40 billion in commitments to date across asset classes, including private equity, private credit, and real estate. This is good progress toward our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising over five years. Additionally, we are encouraged by the expanding number of institutions that are investing with Goldman Sachs. Many pension funds and international institutions participating in recent funding offering are new investing clients to the firm. As we shift towards a greater emphasis on third-party funds, we also continue to work to optimize the capital consumption of our asset management business. To that end, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of growth equity investments in 2020, with a related $2 billion of expected lower capital. We will continue to advance this sell down process in 2021 and beyond to achieve the objectives we set out at our Investor Day. Importantly, as we highlighted at Investor Day, incentive fees on portfolio remain unrecognized until investments are sold and fund return thresholds are achieved. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees currently stand at $1.8 billion. Turning to Page 8, we made meaningful advancements this year in growing our consumer and wealth management segment, particularly in expanding our customer base, improving [ph] our technology platform and leveraging our corporate franchise. We remain committed to delivering tailored advice and simple and transparent financial solutions to our individual clients across the wealth spectrum and our goals here remain integral to our strategic priorities. Our wealth management franchise remains a crown jewel for the firm. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.8 billion, as our clients largely remained invested through uncertain market conditions. And our private wealth management business this success has long been built on the strength, depth and trust of client relationships, which became even more relevant as COVID-19 limited face-to-face interaction. Throughout this period our private wealth advisors have continued to maintain high levels of client engagement and deliver trusted advice. While the environment has caused us to slow some of our hiring efforts in this area, we remain committed to the growth potential of this franchise. We also continue to expand our high net worth platform through Ayco and personal financial management, our rebranded United Capital business. Our Ayco platform achieved its annual goal of bringing more than 30 new corporate clients onto the platform in 2020, as corporates of all types increasingly looked to Ayco for financial planning and wellness solutions. We remain well-positioned to meet this ongoing need given Ayco's broad spectrum of offerings as well as connectivity with our investment banking franchise and our new personal financial management capabilities. We have already begun to see significant synergy as a result of these advantages with over 4000 referrals in 2020 representing over $7 billion of AUS opportunity across these channels. Moving to Page 9, I want to provide some additional detail on our consumer business, which continues to perform well and deliver strong growth. The pandemic has reaffirmed our view that traditional banking has not kept up with the way people live their lives today and The Goldman Sachs is uniquely placed to step into this gap. We\u2019ve had early success launching online savings, lending and credit card and we are now moving to the next phase of our growth plan taking us from a series of singular products to a more comprehensive offering. We are particularly excited about the launch of Marcus invest platform in the U.S. this quarter, which for the first time brings the investing expertise of Goldman Sachs directly to mass affluent customers. Following our U.S. launch we plan to expand to the UK in the second half of the year. Marcus invest will offer individuals the ability to invest as little as $1000 in our proprietary asset allocation strategies with options ranging from index funds to ESG focused ETF. Digital investing features will be integrated into the Marcus app and website and will combine the accessibility, simplicity and transparency of Marcus with our leading investment advisory capabilities. In addition, our new digital checking offering also scheduled for launch this year will deliver an enhanced customer experience that is simpler, and more transparent than what traditional banks have historically offered, providing smart money management tools that help consumers take control of their financial lives. As we grow, we will not only serve customers directly through the Marcus platform, but we will also serve customers through our growing partnership channels. In 2020 we launched four new partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, JetBlue and AARP, while following our first partnership with Apple. We also recently announced a second cobranded credit card with General Motors. Now this is a sign of our ability to be the banking partner of choice for leading corporations across a variety of industries. Our partners value our scale, innovation, engineering prowess, robust infrastructure, regulatory status, and importantly the power of the Goldman Sachs brand. The opportunities set here is very large, with each partner reaching tens of millions of individuals through their existing customer bases. With that as background, let me also comment on 2020 consumer performance, which exceeded our expectations, but which also has implications for our financials as we go forward. We proactively adjusted our strategy beginning in March as the impact of COVID-19 and the evolving market conditions began to take shape. We timed underwriting standards to reduce risk deliberately slowing our consumer loan growth across both unsecured loans and Apple card. Given the economic outlook, we also significantly grew our reserves for potential future losses. At the same time, we continued to raise deposits at a pace meaningfully higher than we had expected, as clients remained attractive to the value of our products and the strength of our brand. Taken together, our pretax loss in consumer, excluding reserve build was reduced versus 2019 levels and lower than our expectations for 2020. Looking forward, we have a clear opportunity to achieve breakeven excluding reserves for our existing products set, including checking and investing in 2022. That achievement would be one year later than initially anticipated due to business adjustments driven by COVID. The 2021 pretax loss for our consumer business, excluding the impact of reserves is likely going to be higher and look more like what we had initially expected for 2020. This is driven by lower value on deposits, tighter credit standards, and additionally the investment in our new General Motors credit card. Beyond 2021, we will continue to invest where appropriate, and opportunities to build additional functionality with our digital bank, as well as to pursue further growth in our partnership channel. In terms of broader functionality, we may look to develop additional products, driving more comprehensive customer experience over time. These investments if pursued may delay our planned breakeven for the business. I want to emphasize, however that should we choose to invest in additional products to broaden our consumer capabilities, it will not affect our ability to meet our enterprise level targets. With respect to partnerships, these opportunities with corporate clients of the firm allow us to commercially engage with a broader consumer population, and are designed to build on the platform based architecture that we have built for our proprietary markets business. Just as we did with Apple card, our intent is to develop differentiated products and service offerings that are embedded in our partners' ecosystems and tailored for the spending, borrowing and investing needs of their customers. From an economic perspective, these opportunities are designed to materially reduce our customer acquisition costs and leverage the embedded cost base of our systems. Furthermore, partnerships we seek to pursue offer the firm potential for mid-teens returns at scale. Each partnership is intended to extend beyond a single product and bring scale to our business on favorable economic terms. Goldman Sachs has a history of building businesses with a long-term orientation. Our investment and our consumer business will continue to be dynamic and appropriately sized to support our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and in the interim, it will not prevent us from reaching our medium term firm wide goals. Before I close, let me share that I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made in 2020, which was a transformative year for Goldman Sachs. Our success could not have been achieved without the extraordinary efforts of our people who continue to put clients at the center of everything we do. I am humbled by the level of commitment I see across our organization every day, knowing many of the personal and professional challenges our people are navigating. As we look forward, I know there will be further challenges, but I am optimistic about the potential for Goldman Sachs in the coming years. I believe in our strategic plan, and our leadership team, and our culture, and in the raw talent of our people. Taken together, these attributes will better enable us to achieve higher and more sustainable returns for our shareholders. Let me now turn it over to Stephen to review funding, expenses and capital as a part of the Investor Day update.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made-to-date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium term funding goals remains a significant source of forward value for the firm. As you will recall, our ambition is to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue uplift over the medium term from growth in deposits, enhancement to our asset liability management and the optimization of our liquidity pool. Along with the broader industry, we experienced material shift in the rate environment in 2020. With Fed funds declining over 150 basis points, the relative value of our deposits remained positive, but lower than projected at Investor Day. What's more, since we are modestly asset sensitive as a firm, our assets re-priced more quickly than our liabilities. As 2020 progressed, we were able to adjust our deposit pricing to reflect the broader downward movement in rates. While we did not achieve savings in 2020 with greater volume, and now updated pricing in the consumer channel, we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion run rate savings target. We also remain well positioned to capture further savings, as we expand our offerings in markets, deepen our client relationships, and rely less on pricing as a lever for customer acquisition. While the focus has been on consumer deposits, our total deposits grew by $70 billion in 2020 across multiple strategic channels, including particularly strong flows in transaction banking. Importantly, deposits comprised approximately 50% of our total unsecured funding base at year end, in line with our medium term target. As the recent environment has helped accelerate our deposit gathering efforts, growth will likely be more moderate in the near term, in light of our entity funding needs. We continue to grow assets within our bank entities, where we have traditionally lagged our peers. We now have approximately one quarter of the firm wide balance sheet, held in the firm's bank entities, versus roughly 15% in 2017. We have also made improvements in our asset liability management that we continue to employ a conservative funding approach focused on term and diversification. Let me now move to Page 11, and expenses. We remain on track to achieve the target laid out at Investor Day of $1.3 billion in expense savings over the medium term, accomplishing approximately half of our goal over the past year. The achievement of these efficiencies has enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020. Our experience over the past 12 months has given us even greater confidence in several of the key elements of this plan. In particular, we are already seeing important benefits from our investment in automation and consolidation of platforms, including increased straight-through-processing rates and reduced cost per trade. In addition, we continue to generate efficiencies from structural adjustments to our employee base through our front-to-back realignment, location strategy and evaluation of pyramid [ph] structure. On the non-compensation front, consolidation of offices in London and Bengaluru [ph] focused on transaction based expenses and more centralized expense management processes have all contributed to early success. The remote work environment has also catalyzed an increased focus on our location strategy. Last January, we expected that 40% of our employees would ultimately work from one of our strategic locations, and we will continue to evaluate the potential for that number to grow over time. We will also look to expand into new strategic locations around the globe, as well as consolidate our footprint, where appropriate in keeping with our evolving business mix. Now turning to Page 12, and capital. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We seek to deploy capital on accretive terms, both in our incumbent businesses, and in areas of growth investment and otherwise return excess to our shareholders. While our ratios initially declined in early 2020, as we committed capital to support clients, navigating the pandemic and we received an SCB result in the 2020 CCAR process that was higher than anticipated. Our standardized CET1 ratio at year end was 14.7% accomplished through strong earnings, lower capital return and disciplined balance sheet management. Importantly, we are pleased with the results of the recent interim stress test and we intend to resume share repurchases this quarter. As in the past, and as permitted, we will continue to reassess our dividend commensurate with the strategic direction of our business. We will be dynamic in our approach, both to reflect proactive steps to reduce capital consumption in the business and as a function of capital requirements more in line with the results of the interim CCAR examination. As such, we continue to target the CET1 ratio of 13% to 13.5% over the medium term, which will inform our capital deployment decisions. As we look ahead, we remain engaged with the Federal Reserve to improve stress modeling in CCAR. As David mentioned earlier, we have already sold or announced the sale of $4 billion in assets with $2 billion of related capital reduction. That said, in the first quarter, we will adjust our equity attribution across our segments to more appropriately reflect the firm's higher SCB based on the results of CCAR 2020. Given the higher stress loss intensity of our equity positions, the capital attributed to asset management will be larger, and so will the capital reduction associated with our intended sell down of assets. This change will not impact our stated medium term targets, and in fact we intend to increase the size and accelerate the pace of asset sales beyond that anticipated at Investor Day, so as to further reduce the capital intensity of the segment beyond our original ambition. Speaking more broadly, there are several key drivers affecting capital requirements for the firm overall. First, our stress capital buffer which we expect to improve as I have noted. Second, our G-SIB surcharge, where we ended the year at 3% to meet client demands, the impact of which will take effect in 2023. And lastly, our management buffer, which we plan to run between 50 and 100 basis points, accounting for volatility and client activity. Before turning to our earnings report, let me finish on Page 13 with a slide that David first presented at Investor Day one year ago. Our strategic direction is guided by these objectives. We are pleased with our progress to date in strengthening our existing businesses, growing our new businesses, and operating the firm more efficiently. Early success in 2020, however, does not diminish our focus on forward execution. We have worked to do from here, and will continue to drive more durable earnings and enhanced returns for our shareholders. In all cases, we will continue our commitment to transparency and accountability and we look forward to updating you further on our progress in the year ahead. With that, let me now switch gears to our separate earnings presentation to cover the fourth quarter, and full year results. First to quickly recap our financial results on Page 1. Fourth quarter net revenues were $11.7 billion, resulting in $44.6 billion for the full year, a growth rate of 22%. In the fourth quarter we delivered net earnings of $4.5 billion and record quarterly earnings per share of $12.8. As David mentioned, the firm delivered full year ROE of 11.1%. Litigation burdened our full year returns by nearly 400 basis points. Turning to Page two and our individual segments. As we noted earlier, Investment Banking delivered outstanding performance in 2020. In the fourth quarter net revenues were $2.6 billion. Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, more than double third quarter levels, reflecting growth in the number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on over 350 transactions that closed during the quarter, representing over $1 trillion of deal volume, roughly $150 billion ahead of our closest peer. Equity underwriting produced a record $1.1 billion of revenue in the quarter, as industry volumes remained elevated, and we continue to gain market share. This just drove record full year revenues in equity underwriting of $3.4 billion, supported by $115 billion of deal volume across nearly 600 transactions. In an extraordinary year for equity issuance we participated in 120 traditional IPOs, 70 private transactions, and a number of SPAC [ph] IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in innovative forms. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $526 million down 8% sequentially, reflecting lower investment grade transactions partially offset by strength in leverage finance. Full year revenues of $2.7 billion were a near record and up 26% versus 2019. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our number three high yield lead table ranking for the year. Looking forward as David mentioned, our investment banking backlog is at near record levels, significantly higher versus the third quarter and a year ago. Client dialogues remain robust and we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FICC and Healthcare. Fourth quarter net revenues from corporate lending were negative $119 million, reflecting roughly $250 million of hedged losses against the relationship loan book as credit spreads tightened. Recall that for risk management purposes, we maintain single name hedges on certain large relationship lending commitments. Of note, in relationship lending, the total notional drawn were funded on revolvers is now back down to pre-COVID levels. Moving to global markets, on Page 3, net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% versus last year. For the full year global markets generated $21.2 billion of net revenues, up 43% versus 2019, driven by stronger FICC and equities intermediation performance. This represents the highest yearly revenues for this segment in a decade. Turning to FICC on Page 4, fourth quarter FICC net revenues were $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. our growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues, where we saw increased client activity, while FICC financing revenues were roughly flat. Three out of five FICC intermediation businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength and breadth of our business. In credit, we saw significantly better performance helped by elevated activity, and market share gains, driven in particular by outperformance in portfolio trading, notably across our digital platforms. In commodities, net revenues were driven by stronger performance across most assets, including metals and agricultural products. In currencies, net revenues rose on solid performance in emerging markets, as volatility rose across most currency pairs. In mortgages and rates, net revenues were lower year-on-year, so client activity remained solid, particularly in mortgages around CMBS and mortgage intermediation and in rates activity remained elevated as a consequence of a number of macro events, including the U.S. election and COVID and the overall reflationary theme. Moving over to equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, up 40% versus a year ago. Full year revenues of $9.6 billion were the highest since 2009. Fourth quarter equities intermediation net revenues of $1.8 billion reflected stronger results in derivatives across all regions, as well as higher cash revenues helped by strong performance in program trading. Equities financing revenues of $591 million were down 19% year-over-year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, as David mentioned, client balances rose to record levels. Moving to asset management on Page 5, our asset management activities produced net revenues of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, asset management generated net revenues of $8 billion, down from a strong 2019 as equity and debt investment performance was challenged in the first half of 2020. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $733 million, up 10% versus a year ago on higher average assets, contributing to record full-year net revenues of $2.8 billion. Across the asset management segment, our AUS stood at a record $1.5 trillion at year end. Our equity investments generated $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter on gains on our public and private investments. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated roughly $745 million in gains from investments, including Caspi [ph] and Sprout. And on our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated net gains of approximately $775 million from various positions, substantially all of which were driven by events, including corporate actions, such as fundraisings, capital market activities, and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $250 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $637 million on revenues from net interest income and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. On Page 6, we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. On equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified, with segment loans largely secured. On Page 7, turning to consumer and wealth management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter. Full year net revenues were $6 billion, up 15% versus a year ago, driven by higher management and other fees and strong consumer banking growth. For the quarter, wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of $1 billion. Full year revenues of $4.8 billion rose 10% year-over-year, and assets under supervision rose to a record $615 billion at year end. Total client assets in this segment exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020. Consumer banking revenues were $347 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to full year revenues of $1.2 billion, which rose 40% year-over-year, and we're diversified across lending, card and savings. Consumer deposits remained stable during the quarter, despite an additional rate reduction, ending the year at $97 billion across the U.S. and U.K., up $37 billion versus last year. Funded consumer loan balances were $8 billion, of which $4 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $4 billion from credit card lending. Importantly, the credit behavior of our loan and credit card portfolio outperformed our expectations. The portfolio benefited from improved underwriting, as well as the consequences of our consumer assistant plants. Next, let's turn to Page 8, for firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS rose to over $2.1 trillion during the quarter and are up nearly $290 billion versus a year ago. The sequential change was driven by $17 billion of long term inflows, $6 billion of liquidity inflows and $86 billion of market appreciation. On Page 9, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up versus a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet, particularly in global markets, as well as the benefit from credit card balances, and repricing of deposits in consumer and wealth management. Equally, this activity is reflective of the decision to allow our G-SIB surcharge to increase to 3%. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $116 billion, up $4 billion sequentially, largely driven by modest growth in loans and consumer and wealth management and real estate warehouse lending. Our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $293 million, roughly flat sequentially and down versus a year ago. The quarter\u2019s provisions were driven primarily by continued growth in lending in our consumer business and wholesale impairments, offset by some reserve leases driven by improving macroeconomic conditions. Given our announced partnership with General Motors and the planned acquisition of the current loan receivables from Capital One, we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of associated provisions in the first quarter. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was flat versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $103 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.7% and for consumer loans of 15.9%. For the full year, we recognized firm-wide net charge offs of $907 million, resulting in an annualized net charge off ratio of 0.9% up 30 basis points versus last year. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our efficiency ratio was 65%, which includes a nearly 800 basis point impact from litigation expense. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to compensating top talent. While compensation expenses were up 8% year-over-year relative to growth in revenue net of provisions for credit losses of 17% our full year compensation ratio is at a record low, reflecting the operating leverage in our franchise. As we have said in the past, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses. Our non-compensation expense, our costs for the full year 2020 rose 25% versus last year, excluding litigation or full year operating expenses grew by only 8% inclusive of investments spent across the business and higher variable expenses associated with transaction volumes. Growth was partially offset by efficiency savings, and lower travel and entertainment costs due to the circumstances of COVID-19. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 18.7% for the fourth quarter and 24.2% for the year, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. We continue to expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21% under the current tax regime. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 11, as previously discussed, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% at the end of the fourth quarter, under the standardized approach up 20 basis points sequentially. Earnings were largely offset by higher RWAs as we stepped in to serve our clients. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 50 basis points to 13.4%. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, rising 3% versus last quarter as we deployed resources to facilitate client activity, particularly within our prime brokerage business. We maintain very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $298 billion, reflecting the current backdrop. On the liability side, our total deposits were roughly flat at $260 billion as planned roll-off of higher costs brokered deposits was partially offset by modest growth in consumer, private bank and transaction banking deposits. In conclusion, our strong fourth quarter and 2020 results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, strong risk discipline and flexibility in our balance sheet deployment. David, John and I are proud of our people for their efforts this year in serving our clients and delivering on our strategic goals, especially given the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to furthering our progress on our medium and long term targets and we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues and higher returns for our shareholders over time.  With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I'm curious, on Slide 6 on the Strategic Update, you went back and reminded us of the medium term target of 10% for global markets - 141 in 2020. Obviously 2020 was just kind of repositioning and need for your assistance. But is that just you being conservative on your best guess of normalized trading, like nothing changed there? And I'm just curious in the way capital is being re-shifted towards asset management for private equity, I just didn't know if we should be reading anything more than the obvious into the medium term trading targets.\nStephen Scherr: Hey, Glenn its Steven. No, there's nothing more to read. We were just on this slide, reiterating the medium term targets that we had set at 10%. I would point out that well reported ROE in 2020, for global markets was 14.1%. The performance ex-litigation that's otherwise allocated to the segment was 18.1%. I think the other point I would make here is that, as we look forward, and as we've commented several times, impossible to know what 2021 and beyond hold in terms of what the industry is presented, but I think there have been some fairly profound structural shift in that business. One, of course, is the expense base is being reduced. The second is we're much more attuned to the sort of agile deployment of capital across. But I think perhaps most important, is the improvement of wallet share and the focus on clients. And David commented a couple of times on the improvement in overall wallet share growing by 120 basis points through three quarters, and we'll see what played out for the full year. But I'd also say that a step up in where we stand with the objective of being top three across the top 100 institutional clients and global markets, I think also reflects that we will capture at or better than our share on a going forward basis. Again, acknowledging that the market may not look as robust on the forward as it did in 2020 for this business, but the structural changes are important.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Maybe the same kind of concept for the follow up related to investment management. So I get the allocation of more capital, I get the capital that you freed up on the announced sales. I know that when you were initially going down this path, I felt optimistic of your ability to raise lots of third party money and you have. So I wonder if you have a thought process on 2021 or it's just continually marching towards the 150. And then the same, I was concerned about settling down. Private Equity would leave and earnings pick up at some point. But being that you have almost $2 billion in unrecognized incentive fees, do you feel like you can continue down this free up capital sell down private equity raised third party path without a big earnings hiccup.\nStephen Scherr: Thanks Schorr. Yes, thanks so much. So let me take both of those first. On fundraising, I think what's gratifying about the progress made in 2020 was a comment David made about an increasing number of clients new to the firm that are investing with Goldman Sachs. And so, that leaves us optimistic about the prospect of the fundraising pipeline in 2020, which will be across a range of different investing sleeves and we'll start to see, that growing number of investing clients look across a range of different product offerings that we have. On the sell down, we're very attentive and have always been, to the prospect of creating kind of a canyon, and we don't anticipate that to happen and we'll continue to manage with that in mind. Now you draw the right observation, which is, there's $1.8 billion of embedded fees to take, which we will take when gains become irrevocable or irreversible and so that will buffer, but the point here is that, our objective is to reduce the stress loss intensity of that segment. And so we've spoken about $4 billion in balance sheet sales to yield $2 billion of capital relief. We equally have line of sight into another $2.5 billion of sales, which could generate another billion dollars of capital relief. And I'd also point out, though it's not obvious in the way in which the results play, but over the course of the year, we sold $2.1 billion of public equities to offset about $1.9 billion of appreciation in market value and so that equally has capital consequence for us. And so you'll continue to see us move along that road. Finally, on the question or the observation you made about what I was speaking to about what we will do in terms of attributed equity to that segment, that has no bearing on what our objective is, which is to bring capital down. But as CCAR 2020 was higher, more capital came to the firm, we don't keep a corporate segment. So we allocate or attribute that equity out to the segments, by definition, because of its intensity, asset management will pick up more capital. Obviously, on a unit of balance sheet reduction, more capital will come out as we reduce positions, which is why we're confident that we'll maintain at or better than what we're indicating in terms of capital reduction in the segment overall.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe I'll start on Marcus and the digital bank. Thanks for the strategical update there, but stepping back a bit, how do you think your digital banks current and future offerings are stacked up against very successful fintechs like a sci-fi, or a chime? And then just given the very big valuations those companies have gotten, is there a way for you as a management team to better unlock the value of this digital bank for shareholders.\nDavid Solomon: So, Christian, I'll start with that. Good morning and thank you for the question. I -- and we tried to highlight this in the update that we're working to go from a product structure, we handful of products to a much more integrated offering for our customers. And so when you ask about comparison to some of the some of the fintechs, I just say the Fin-techs are much more narrow in scope, in terms of what they offer, and don't have the broad capabilities that we have. And we're betting and we're expanding on for our clients. So just in the context of, the two examples that you gave, and highlighting so fire chime, when you think about spending across both checking and credit cards, when you think about borrowing across credit cards and loans, and you think about savings, and also investing and the investment capabilities that we have as a wealth manager, we have a much broader integrated offering and we continue to get feedbacks of the state-of-the-art product platform. And the digital applications that we have, are really excellent by any standards. So we're going to continue to move forward with that long-term strategy. I don't really have a comment on the valuation of these businesses, although I'm watching with everyone else, and I'm looking at what we have, the number of clients we have, the number of customers the size of our business, the scale that we have as we continue to move forward and I am looking at that opportunity, the growth that we have, and if people like those businesses. I think at some point in time, they should, like and value our business, more fulsomely but we'll continue to execute and wait on that. We really like our model of having a proprietary platform for Marcus, but then also, given our corporate relationships, the potential for partnerships is very, very strong for us. And I think you saw that in our execution this year, by adding four more partnerships by capturing the GM Card, and I think you'll continue to see us do more on this front. And so we feel good about it, but as I said in my comments, we're taking a long term view in what we're doing and none of this will affect our medium term targets that we're working toward at the end of 2022, gets a lot of attention, but it won't affect our targets.\nChristian Bolu: Okay, thank you. Maybe the question I was asking really around evaluation was, is there something you can do other than spin off, the division of something to get better valuation, better currency to build a business, but I'd hear your points? Maybe my second question apologies, this one is a bit of a nifty question. But I'm trying to understand the impact of interest rates on the Marcus business against the earnings release, he called out higher funding costs and lower yields on the liquidity reserves as a headwind to the Marcus business. But also, in the actual deck, we saw a really big step up in global markets NII quarter-over-quarter. So let me just step back here remind us how interest rates impact the business? What are it\u2019s the current level of interest rates, you look at \u2013 there is the shape of the yield curve, and then some of the liability management actions you've taken? How does that impact the markets business I guess over the coming year?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So NII Christian, as you noted, grew, it was at $1.4 billion for the firm in the quarter. That was driven largely by balance sheet growth, notably in growth markets, and most especially in prime. So our prime balances were up. The challenging aspect for us and the reference made in the context of funding is that our liquidity grew over the quarter, we were slower to adjust, particularly on the retail deposit side pricing of our liabilities and so we didn't capture quite what we wanted. Obviously, we've now brought rates down and so, we're able to sort of allocate that cost out to the business. So liabilities are important. NII expanded because of balance sheet and impact overall net funding costs. And so that's the reference, if you will, to the headwinds notwithstanding prime balance is growing, funding costs were higher than we wanted, that notwithstanding NII grew because of overall balance sheet growth over the course of the quarter in prime and by virtue overall of moving to a higher G-SIB, in the context of meeting client demands.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carrier: Good morning, and thanks for the update and taking the question. First, just as we get to moderation in global markets, can you provide some color on what areas of the business and strategic initiatives are best positioned to potentially create some offset overstay like the next one to two years? I think it seems like asset management, could be one of those. Well, some of the initiatives may be further out, but any color on timing of growth away from some, accepted moderation in global markets?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, I mean, I think that first, obviously, what we've been speaking about within the asset management business and the growth of third party alternatives and, forward durability of those revenues, is one area. There's obviously growth in some of the growth initiatives, including transaction banking, as well as what we're doing on the consumer side. And so you'll continue to see pickup and share pickup. None of those are necessarily meant to be compensating factors for what could be a shortfall in global markets. I think within global markets, we will buffer structurally speaking, what might be a less impressive opportunity set on the forward relative to 2020 by virtue of what we've done around market share gains, and equally, what we're doing around the cost base. And I'd say also, if you look within the global markets business, what we're seeing in terms of the growth in low touch, high volume activity around Marquee and the digital platforms, particularly growth in portfolio trading across, I think all of those will spell sort of improved performance as a general matter notwithstanding the market. Finally, I'd point out that the investment banking footprint continues to expand. And that too will provide an offset to the extent that again, the assumption to your question that we see lower opportunity as an industry matter within the trading or global markets business?\nMichael Carrier: Okay great and then just on the capital side, so given your CET1 ratio of premium above your expected buffer. How are you thinking about either need for the business, either organic or M&A versus capital return? And just your commentary on the asset management business and understanding maybe the models, is that a bit more like how significant could that be longer term as you kind of reposition into that?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, so on capital, look, our capital philosophy really remains unchanged, which is we look for opportunities for creative return on investment in capital in the business and equally meeting, you know, client demands that are there. Separate from that, it's my expectation that we will hit our first quarter repurchase expectations, which based on the calculation of the Fed will be about $1.9 billion in the quarter plus neutralizing equity based compensation expense. And so we will fulfill that in the first quarter. I'd also repeat a comment I made in the prepared remarks is that we'll continue to reevaluate our dividend in the context of the shape and form of the business being more durable going forward. Obviously, that's not a first quarter proposition, given the Fed rules, but you can certainly rely on the repurchase expectations and our fulfillment of them. In terms of asset management, this is all about an overall reduction in the balance sheet intensity of that business. It is being mindful of revenue in the near term. It is driving down on balance sheet investing, and moving that into third party activity, doing that across more sleeves with more clients of the firm. And I think that will, continue to take down our capital. And I suspect based on the progress we made in 2020, of taking 2 billion on 4 billion of sales. And as I mentioned, our forward view on what's, within line of sight, incremental capital will come out, at or better than the expectations we carried at the Investor Day itself.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning everyone. So I wanted to start off with a question on the trading business. Now your share gains and trading for 2020 were quite impressive and likely represent the strongest gains across the entire global IB cohort. And historically, you've been the dealer of choice for clients during periods of macro stress, given your risk and your mediation expertise and those client needs will be magnified this year due to COVID. Raising questions as to why they're the share gains will be sustainable as those client needs moderate. And I was hoping you can give some perspective on what gives you confidence that you could sustain the recent share gains in global markets as activity normalizes and any differences you're seeing across high versus low touch might be very helpful.\nDavid Solomon: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Steve, I'll start. And I appreciate the question. And I'll just, to take your framing, you said historically, at times of severe stress, you've been a dealer of choice. And you really -- you make that statement by going back and looking at one window, which was the financial crisis, and there's no question in the financial crisis, we had very, very significant share gains. But I would highlight that one of the reasons that we had very significant share gains during the financial crisis is that a lot of the people that would be in our core competitive set, were in a position of very, very weak, structural financial performance, at the time, and it definitely inhibited their ability to intermediate with clients. So one of the things I recall hearing at that time, is a lot of firms did not show up during the financial crisis. And we benefited from that. I think, hopefully, we benefited for other reasons. But there was a different component. We have a very, very different situation right now. Banks have been a source of strength during the pandemic. All of our competitors have showed up in spades and yet we have very, very significant share gains. Now, maybe some of that is a branded reputation that were a dealer of choice during the pandemic, but I would argue a bigger impact in really affecting how we perform and I've heard this consistently from our global markets clients, is a change strategically in our approach over the last few years, in terms of how we're facing clients, or one GS approach and what we're trying to do. We talked a little bit in the strategic update and talking about how for the first time over the last couple of years, we have a targeted approach, and evaluating our wallet share with the top 100 clients, seems relatively straightforward. But this is not something we had ever done historically. And that we advanced that considerably over the course of 2020, by going from top-three with 51 of the clients to top three of 64 of the clients. We have a much more client centric approach. I got a lot of feedback calls this year from our clients, noticing what they said was a very different approach in the way Goldman Sachs interacted with them now then versus 10 years ago. And so I would argue across the platform, that orientation is helping a while share [Ph] gains. Now, I'm not going to sit here and say that in a different environment, when the world is more even, and we're not in a crisis, that there's not going to be a flattening. In fact, I'd say that across all our businesses. We tend to outperform in investment banking during times of stress, and the market share gains collapse a little bit in times when everything is very, very easy. And so I'm sure there'll be some of that. But we have a very, very clear strategy, or a very clear client centric strategy that is different. And I think it's led to enhanced wallet share gains. I'd also say and we highlighted this in the context of looking at that business. This goes back to one of the earlier questions, we've made structural improvements, not just in the client approach, but also in the cost base of that business and in our capital allocation in that business. And the results are even if we have a different available client wallet, we have a structurally more profitable business on a go forward basis. And so that's the way we're thinking about that. I hope that's helpful.\nStephen Scherr: The one of the thing I would add to the part of your question you asked about kind of high touch and low touch, which is, if you look at our credit business in FIC, over Q2, Q3 and Q4, what's interesting is in Q2 and Q3, you saw amidst very high volatility, a lot of the sort of bespoke idiosyncratic, block like activity that we've long been known for. What's interesting is, if you look at Q4, we started to see very high portfolio trading going on, rebalancing among asset managers, pension funds, a lot of that going on across our digital platforms. I'd just offer you that Q2, Q3 and then Q4, as a reflection of kind of a more, a broader, more robust business, that's better equipped, better capabled, better positioned to capture what we've long been known to do, as we did in the second and third quarter. And some of the more technology driven, platform driven, trading, that is newer, and quite sticky in the context of what we can keep.\nSteven Chubak: Yes. It's really interesting color. I appreciate the perspective from both of you. And just for my follow up on efficiency, you spoke with your continued efforts to evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings and was hoping you could just give some perspective on what some of those opportunities might be and especially as we think about the need to potentially flex in a tougher macro backdrop. And just one clarifying point is the 650 million of savings. Should we be thinking about the savings already captured versus the 4Q \u201820 baseline? Or is that versus the full year 20 expense base?\nDavid Solomon: I'll start on that. I'll let Stephen answer the second point about the second point with respect to the 650. But I just what, Steven, I think the way you should understand that we're thinking about this is we've been re-underwriting the firm, and trying to do what we can across the platform to operate more efficiently. We set out a target on or Invest Day. And we had a very clear view on the path to that target. When we said that a year ago at our Investor Day, and we're marching through and we're executing on that. With respect to other opportunities, we continue to evaluate other opportunities. And it would be hard pressed to say that we didn't learn a lot this year in the context of the operating environment, that we've looked that we've been operating this year. And so that's giving us new insights into other places across the platform where things can be more efficient. In addition, our business like lots of businesses is digitizing. And in the context of that it's allowing us to digitize processes that historically we've used, we've executed with more manual, personnel sort to speak. So we're going to continue to focus on that. We do think there are other opportunities, when we have more to say to be more specific, with our continued focus on transparency will give you more specifics.\nStephen Scherr: Yes, to the first part of your question, achieving $1.3 billion was annualized savings. So we would realize these savings each and every year. And this was as against kind of entry level expenses, meaning entering into 2020 when we announced them at Investor Day, but this is achieving a $1.3 billion annual run rate savings of which about half has been achieved. The only other thing I would add, on the forward is obviously COVID has accelerated our own thinking about moving populations and taking aggregations of people into different areas and so I think, you know, we feel more assured and confident at our ability to do that, the pace of it, and you'll continue to see that play forward in the achievement is the 1.3 or beyond.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJeffery Harte: Good morning. Sorry about that.\nDavid Solomon: Hey, Jeff. I am coming through now?\nJeffery Harte: Yes, fine. Hey how are you thinking about the cyclical outlook for capital markets activity levels broadly? I guess I come from there's a belief out there that the strength in 2020 was really just a stimulus driven anomaly and maybe we're headed back to 2019 levels. But when I look at historical cyclicality and activity level indicators, it suggests potential staying sustainability if not continued growth. I mean, how are you thinking about that as we move into 2021 and 2022?\nDavid Solomon: Well, it's, I'll take this at a high level, Jeff. Obviously, it's hard to when I wouldn't speculate, going out for multiple years, but what I would say is we're still in the middle of a pandemic, there's still an enormous amount of stimulus. And there's also because of the acceleration of digital trends, there are lots of businesses and lots of CEOs that are rethinking or re underwriting strategically how they're positioned. So corporate activity, and therefore capital markets activity in that context is high. Certainly, as we head into 2021, there are a lot of indicators, that that's going to continue in 2021, certainly in the near term. And so our expectation is, certainly in the near term, that activity will continue. To the degree that we get to a more normalized environment, the degree that there is a backing off of fiscal activity to the degree over time, there's a more normalization of monetary policy, that obviously can affect this activity level. But that's not something we'd expect in the near term and 2021. So at the moment, pipeline backlogs, things that we can see, continue to look robust. That doesn't mean that we're saying that we expect to repeat of everything we saw in 2020. And there certainly are different parts of both the banking and the Marcus business that I think were elevated in 2020. And our expectations for 2021 are not as robust as they weren't 2020, but certainly more robust than they were in 2019.\nJeffery Harte: Okay, and thank you. Secondly, as you continue to grow deposits, are you facing limits on your ability to deploy the incremental deposit growth? I guess, when I look at your balance sheet, I see deposit investable, earning asset growth is more of a pressing need the additional deposit growth?\nStephen Scherr: Yes, I mean, I think that, on the forward, you should expect a more moderated level of growth in deposits. As we pull more and more assets into the bank. I think, as I noted in the remarks, we've moved from 15% of assets in the banks to 25%, but importantly, on incremental asset movement, 90% of the lending that's going on, in and around the firm is being booked in bank entities that will consume deposit funding that goes on in the bank entities themselves. I'd also point out that when we speak about bank entities, we're not only speaking about our U.S. Bank, but equally the U.K. and our bank, in Continental Europe, in Germany, all of which have slightly different requirements in terms of the deployment of that funding, but the incremental asset flow is going into the bank, and you're going to start to see continued growth from 25% of the overall firm.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nStephen Scherr: Hi Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Good morning. Question on the expense side, just a two part; one, on the comp and the comp ratio. We did say the comp ratio come down on a full year basis, roughly 400 basis points year-on-year. And I'm just wondering, is that really a function of non-compensatable revenues that that shot up significantly year-on-year or this reflects the comments you were making earlier about moving people to the strategic locations, it feels like a lot in one year. So just trying to unpack the major drivers and how we should see that, how we should expect that flexes going forward?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I think the, the abiding observation here is that there is considerable leverage in the business. That is when we'd grow revenue top line by 22% or grow at 17% net of provision for credit loss, you see our comp and benefit line rise by 8%. So there's embedded leverage in this business. I think, as we've also said in the past, and this is reflected a little bit in your question, the comp ratio is going to become much less of a relevant metric in this, in part, because the profile of the business will change. That is, as we grow up, businesses like transaction banking or the consumer business, they will be less comp heavy in terms of overall expense and that ratio will be ultimately less relevant. But I think, for where we are right now, there's considerable leverage in this where we're capable of rewarding our talent for performance overall, but equally doing that on a levered basis, so that our shareholders and shareholders benefit more broadly from the overall performance.\nBetsy Graseck: And could we just get a sense on the tech budget that you've got right now and how you're thinking about that size and growth over the next, year or so?\nStephen Scherr: Yes, I think the tech budget is going to continue to grow. It will grow by several $100 million dollars year-over-year. It will do that really for two reasons; one, continued improvement at the core, that is the way in which the firm operates more broadly. It is achievement of some of what David was talking about around automation and the like. And then separately, it will be focused on particular initiatives, like transaction banking, like the consumer business, and so forth. And I think part of, our focus on the efficiencies that we're capable, and the cost savings we're capable of getting is such that those savings can subsidize the investment being made in places like technology around the firm. And so you'll continue to see that investment play out. We have less remedial activity than perhaps some of the other bigger commercial banks have and as much as we have a lot of new tech build and new activity going on. But we're going to continue to look to harvest cost savings to substantially offset the impact of that increased investment.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi, could you get more color on your backlog? You said, it's near record, its update quarter-over-quarter and specifically as it relates to SPACs, how much have SPACs contributed to revenues in 2020 and what's the multiplier effect? I understand it's linked with mergers and leveraged finance, where your top three are number one, just for more color in SPACs and how it relates to the backlog and what that's been contributing and how sustainable that is?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So, a couple of comments. Backlog levels, as we stated, are up quarter-over-quarter. And I'd say that activity levels broadly across the banking platform are up. Certainly SPAC activities contributing to it. But strategic corporate M&A is up meaningfully. And what I say is that was a real kind of doldrums as the pandemic hit, and people were reorganizing, but as we came out in the summer and people started to kind of look through the tunnel, and get a sense of where things were going. Strategic activity, with corporates really picked up and that's contributed, meaningfully also and that has nothing really to do with the SPAC ecosystem. On SPACs Mike, I'll say a couple of things. And there's no question that, the growth of SPACs as a product that definitely affected activity levels. But there are a few things that I'd say, just to try to frame it. SPACs were a little bit more than 50% of IPO activity this year. But when you look at IPO activity, IPO activity for us, for example, was on a volume basis, about 17% of our equity volume. So we did about $20 billion of IPO lead table against $115 billion of equity lead table, 17%. If you look at our IPO fees, all IPOs, SPAC and non-SPAC, and again, SPACs was say around 50%. But if you look at our IPO fees, our IPO fees were less than 40% of all our equity underwriting fees and then SPACs would be a subset of that. Now to your point, it also creates an ecosystem around capital rising around advisory services, et cetera. And so there's no question that that ecosystem at the moment is creating a tailwind for some of these capital market activities. So a couple of other things I'd say, first, we generally strive to be number one in the lead tables. We do not strive to be number one, in the SPAC lead tables, we are very well, we're very active, we're very thoughtful about our sponsors and the business that we take on. And just looking at last year, if you look at the number of SPACs that were done and the lead table leaders, the number one and number two firms did about 33% more deals than we did, representatives, I think of some of the things that came to us that we turned away. So we're participating, but we're trying to participate. But picking what we think are the best situations, I do think SPACs is a good use case, versus a traditional IPO, and advantages for sellers and for investors and looking at this ecosystem. But the ecosystem is not without flaws. I think it's still evolving. I think the incentive system is still evolving. One of the things we're watching very, very closely is the incentives of the sponsors, and also the incentives of somebody that selling. And while I think these activity levels continue to be very robust, and that they do continue as we head into 2021 continue to be very, very robust. I do not think this is sustainable in the medium term. And there'll be something that will, in some way, shape or form, bring the activity levels down over a period of time. But we're watching it closely. And it's something that our clients continue to be very, very interested in. There are lots of companies that go public via SPAC that could also go public and a traditional IPO. And there's some companies that go public and a SPAC that probably couldn't go public through the standardized process of a traditional IPO. And all of those are things that the market will have to less with. And one of the things I certainly think is the case is you have something here it's a good capital markets innovation. But like many innovations, there's a point in time as they start, where they have a tendency, maybe to go a little bit too far, and then need to be pulled back or rebalanced in some way. And that's something my guess is we'll see over the course of 2021 or 2022, with SPACs.\nMike Mayo: And then one more a general question, David. So I think what I hear you say on this call is that it's not a forecast, but kind of your expectation for capital markets for this year might be a little bit less than, last year, but it should still be better than 2019 or something like that. We had a decade long reduction in wallet share in the markets business. Do you think that decade long reduction, considering it normalized last year, do you think that's reversing? Some people say it is some people say it won't?\nDavid Solomon: So, two points, I think, Mike to the questions if I got it right. With, I'm not going to speculate on a forecast on a specific forecast around capital markets activity. But I do think your statement is fair in terms of the way I framed it, which is capital markets activity is starting \u201821 very robust. Based on the data we have, it seems like it will continue to be relatively robust in 2021. But we don't expect it to be at the same level that it was in 2020. With respect to your second question, I assume you're asking about global markets wallet share. Were you asking about banking and markets wallet share? Mike?\nOperator: One moment, let me open Mike\u2019s line.\nDavid Solomon: Mike?\nMike Mayo: Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, trading is decade? Yes.\nDavid Solomon: Global market you're talking about?\nMike Mayo: Correct.\nDavid Solomon: Okay. So I talked earlier on the call, about the way over the last two and a half years, we've evolved our strategy. And I think the strategy we have for our global markets business is a good strategy for Goldman Sachs. I like our position, and we've consolidated share. Why have we done that? We've done that because we have a very client centric approach, a very holistic one Goldman Sachs approach. We have a much more targeted wallet share approach through the largest institutional clients that we interact within that business and that has allowed us to strengthen our position. And so, I can't go back and make all the direct comparisons that everybody wants, but I think there are a lot of things. And I stated some of this earlier that are very different about what we saw coming out of the financial crisis and what evolved versus where we're operating today. So the wallet may change, but I think we've made material strides and strengthened our position in global markets, and I expect us to hold a number of those wallet share gains and we're very, very focused on making sure we do.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. So first is on the investments that you're making on the consumer side, there's regular speculation in the press around, maybe what you might be considering on the M&A front and actually, the speculation has centered on consumer banking. And so, could you help is the indication and the idea that you guys are interested in investing in that business and, pushing that impacting some of the targets, a, sort of a clear indication that you're really interested in building rather than buying. And, as I sit here, I just kind of wonder, okay, why would these guys want to invest so much, if they had, if there was something large that they were looking to do, in anything remotely close to the near term? Just curious, your thoughts on that, whether that's too big a leap?\nDavid Solomon: Well, there's a lot there in what you said, Brennan, but I'm going to repeat something that I've said over and over again. We're focused on building an integrated digital platform in the consumer space, I think over the last four plus years, we're off to a very good start, we've given you lots of metrics, we can track that progress. And we continue to roll out on the investments that we're making, including, as we said, you'll see invest this quarter, Marcus invest this quarter, and you'll see checking during the course of the year. With respect to M&A opportunities broadly, whether it's to expand our consumer offering, whether it's the grower asset management business, whether it's to expand our wealth management capability, we're always looking for ways to accelerate our strategic growth plans, if something came along that helped us accelerate or advance our strategic growth plan. And we thought that it was a good fit strategically, and we thought, we could acquire it and integrate it attractively, then we would do it, just as we did with United Capital, but the bar to do something significant is extremely high. And it's not an easy thing to do. So, we'll continue to look for things that can accelerate our growth plan. But we're going to continue to invest in these businesses. And I think the important thing for you to note is that we have a lot of confidence that these can be sizable businesses at scale, that are accretive to Goldman Sachs's return, even if we do not do something significant and organically.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, thanks for that. And then my second one is on the efficiencies and I know there have been a few questions there. But, from my perspective, it's, I guess it's just a little bit hard to unpack some and see some of the 650 that you referenced earlier, Steven. You guys have a lot of revenue and volume sensitivity on your expense side. And that's, usually particularly true on the comp front. So, maybe how much of the 650 was in non-comp versus comp? And, what is your expectation for the timing on the remaining 650? Any color that you can kind of give.\nStephen Scherr: Yeah. So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on non-comp expense in the year. So, our non-comp was up 8% ex-litigation of about $900 million of non-comp expense increase year-over-year, about two thirds in excess of $600 million was variable expense, BC&E, all of which is related to the volume of activity that's coming through. And so, I just framed that just so you have a sense of how, non-comp framed out over the course of the year. Now, if you look at our achievement of about half of the 1.3 billion of run rate efficiencies that we've set as a target for ourselves, I would say up through the end of 2020, a good proportion of that came out of the compensation side, okay, relative to non-comp. So by that, I mean, we've undertaken a very significant exercise over the course of 2020 at spans and layers, meaning we've looked at the sheer number of people we have in a variety of, of parts of the organization. We've looked at scope of management, and we've been able to sort of achieve efficiencies in that regard. We engaged in a front to back exercise that put more people from an ops and technology point of view, in line of sight of the people in the business, who know and understand what their objectives are and where they're going. Third is we've looked at at location of where many of these people are and have accelerated that. And so that's on the sort of compensation side. On the non-compensation side, I would say that we've done a complete rationalization of campuses in places like London and in Bangalore, harvesting significant savings there, we've moved to a more disciplined and centralized planning tool. We've looked to centralize our expense management through SAP taking multiple platforms and bulling them into one, we've looked to centralize our expense management, through SAP, taking multiple platforms, and pulling them into one, all of these have sort of put us in a position to realize about 50% of the 1.3 billion, and frankly speaking, give us a bit more confidence about what we can achieve on the forward, perhaps in excess of it. And so that may be a bit more granular than you want, but just to lay out sort of the elements, right, of where these expenses are being harvested.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. David, you've been very clear about the difference in your success in this stress period versus 2008 and 2009. And we all know, the consolidation of the broker dealer community over the last 25 years has been dramatic. Can you address your success based on economies of scale, and how -- I know you've done a very good job on the customer centric focus that you've talked about already. But how important is the economies of scale today, versus maybe five or 10 years ago? And is that an advantage that you and some of your peers have over the smaller broker dealers?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So Gerard, I think it's a good question. I appreciate it. And I think there's a huge advantage. And so, putting aside some of the things I'm talking about, that are strategically based on our conscious decisions, we happen to be, one of the handful of firms that is global at scale on a market leader, in these global markets and investment banking businesses, and I think it is increasingly difficult to compete in these businesses, unless you're global and at scale, unless you have the capacity to make very, very significant technology investments into platforms to better connect with your clients. And so there has been a consolidation of wallet share into the leading players across these platforms. And we continue to be one of those players. And I think that position has only grown and then been strengthened. I also would point out that we don't just have scale broadly, we've stayed committed, as I highlighted earlier in my remarks to all the different silos and asset classes across our markets business. So you think about the many asset classes across markets, we benefited because we stayed committed to commodities, and we have a more fulsome offering for our clients. And there was a real benefit to that this year. So, I think there's no question, the leading firms have a strong competitive advantage. I think to maintain that competitive advantage and have reasonable margins, given the capital requirements, the technology requirements, the regulatory requirements, being in a leadership position is much more important today than it was 15, 20, 25 years ago.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then just quickly, Stephen, on the capital position, and when the Federal Reserve releases all the banks from the limitations on share repurchases based on the income equation they have given you guys, would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program, once everybody's released from that limitation?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I think, the manner and form of our execution sort of will decide and you know, proceed forward. What I would reiterate is that, right now the Fed is not quite at the SCB regime that had been laid out initially. Remember, SCB was meant to put banks in a position. All banks, if you're above your minimum, you can go about share repurchase, dividend, et cetera. We're not there yet, the Fed has limited what we can do on repurchase. As I spoke about earlier, we will execute to the capacity that we have to repurchase in the first quarter. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the mechanism by which we will do it. But certainly, safe to rely on the fact that we'll look to use our capacity and proceed from there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Yes, thanks. Just two questions here. First, may be just clarification on the provision that you mentioned from the credit card relationship, I think it was $200 million attributed to that is when I show that a gross number or are you saying that the provision expense in the first quarter is 200 million on a net basis?\nStephen Scherr: Sure, so just to be clear in connection with the back book that we're acquiring relative to the GM partnership, we anticipate taking approximately $200 million of provisions in the first quarter. So to be clear, it's not reflected in 2020. I'm just giving you and the market sort of an indication of what that will be occasioned by the acquisition of that backlog. And that's an accounting, rule and requirements that we are adhering to.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: And then also as it relates to the reserve, I mean, given what, expectations for economic conditions from here, I mean, when do you expect kind of the more reserved, the leases are larger, I guess, reserve releases on a go forward basis?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So again, in the fourth quarter, we're taking provision for credit loss of 293 million, I will tell you that embedded in that is a release of about $200 million, occasioned by better macroeconomic observations and adjusting the model and reserve release. That release though was offset in the context of incremental provisions either occasioned by impairments or growth in the overall portfolio. So it's not to reflect anything negative or a negative comment on the state of our performance of the portfolio, but rather growth in it across the whole of the firm. I would say as an aside, we continue to see our consumer portfolio performed better from a credit perspective than even what we had anticipated coming into the crisis. But embedded in the provision is release that release offset by growth and by impairments.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nJames Mitchell: Hey, good morning. You seem to be progressing pretty well toward your targets. But I think whether you look at consensus expectations or talk to investors, there seems to be some skepticism around you hitting, the 14% ROTE, the 60% efficiency ratio in 2022. I mean, I think that reflects some uncertainty around the trajectory of trading in IB. But, maybe we can take a step back and just ask it this way, I guess, what kind of growth were you assuming in those kind of more volatile revenue streams? It doesn't seem like initially, it was a lot of growth expected from 2019 levels. But I guess maybe asking the question this way, do you still feel comfortable hitting those targets in 2022 with revenues in sort of trading and investment banking similar to \u201819 or does it have to be materially higher?\nStephen Scherr: So remember, on the efficiency ratio, and obviously, it's implied by your question, there's revenue and there's an expense component to it. On the revenue side, we saw more growth in 2020, than had been anticipated. But we nonetheless expect levels of growth consistent with what we anticipated at our Investor Day. And I'd also point out that we continue to work on the expense side, as we've spoken about in relation to a number of questions on this call, and there continues to be leverage in the business to the extent that revenue growth doesn't materialize. As we expected, we've got levers to pull on expense, which is why we are comfortable, with a view that will achieve an efficiency ratio at around 60% by 2022. Obviously, we were better than that X litigation in 2020. There will be variability to it. But, there are levers to pull as and to the extent that the growth doesn't play, but we're assuming that it will. And it it's not entirely reliant on global markets.\nJames Mitchell: Right. I think the assumption was very minimal growth in sort of those core businesses, excluding some of the investments. Is that fair?\nStephen Scherr: Yes, I think that's fair.\nDavid Solomon: That's fair.\nJames Mitchell: All right. Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you and thanks for the strategy update. You've talked a bit about growth, in the previous question, some of the earlier ones. But growth, I'm thinking of the organic build in some of your new businesses, the transaction bank and the consumer businesses. I wondered if you could put those in the context of the evolving environment that faces us in 2021 with still some areas of stress continuing, but some areas of recovery, which are those new businesses, do you see accelerating the growth or slowing or changing the game plan of how you proceed?\nDavid Solomon: Well, it's interesting, I mean, I think that we should take them each on their own. In transaction banking, I think what we have hit is a resonating chord with our clients about the nature of what we've built, meaning we've built a new and improved digital Interface by which corporations can manage their operational flows. And that has been a refreshing change to kind of legacy platforms that have been there. I say that not as just simply an observer, but also a consumer of that service, where Goldman Sachs is using its own platform. And I think that will continue, in part because operational flows across corporate\u2019s will continue, almost notwithstanding what plays out in the context of the market movement. Overall, the consumer side may be a different proposition. Now, it depends on the perspective you take with respect to, GDP growth, and what happens with rates and the like. But I think, as David has said, on the consumer side, we are playing for the long term, that is building relationship with 10s of millions of consumers and pivoting in 2021, to a broader, more comprehensive platform that I think will attract more consumers to the platform, not simply because there's an attractiveness to the deposit rate or to rate on lending, but because we'll offer a more comprehensive package of investing and checking, and will become a more reliable primary bank, to more consumers. And I think that'll play out again, kind of notwithstanding where the markets otherwise take us on some of the more capital markets intensive activity.\nJeremy Sigee: And just a follow up in a different area. In the global markets business, we've talked a lot on the call about the outlook for volumes and for volatility. But it feels like one of the elements of strength this past year has been wider bid offer spreads. I wondered if you could sort of comment, you agree with that observation that's been a contributing factor to the strength? And how you see that evolving? Do you think we see a return of pressure on trading profitability as we go forward?\nStephen Scherr: So I'm going to go back to a response I made to one of the questions earlier, which is, Q2 and Q3 look different than Q4, we experienced and benefited from wider bid offer during the intensity of what played out in Q2 and Q3 and the fact as David has mentioned now several times that we stayed the game and showed up across a range of asset classes helped us and we benefited from that. There's no question that has moved to the back of the year in Q4, you saw compression from what was wide in Q2 and Q3. But there again, wallet share gains benefited us, and equally, playing to both high touch and low touch. And so the advent of what we were doing through marquee, and equally through portfolio trading on these electronic platforms was of equal benefit. So tighter bid offer there as opposed to wider bid offer in Q2. But I think you're seeing a business that is more diverse, broader and in a position to continue to intermediate flows and do so with very high balance sheet velocity.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions, please continue with any closing remarks.\nStephen Scherr: Since there are no more questions, we'd like to take a moment to thank everybody for joining the call on behalf of the senior management team. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months and if there any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather and her team, otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks Heather, and thank you to everybody for joining us this morning. Let me begin with Page 1 of our strategic update presentation. I'm pleased to report that 2020 was a year of strong performance for Goldman Sachs, as we successfully navigated unexpected operating backdrop characterized by near record volatility and correspondingly high client activity. This year was marked by an extraordinary decline in economic activity in the second quarter brought on by COVID-19 and a dramatic reversal in the third and fourth quarter as economic output and unemployment partially reversed course. This volatility contributed to severe dislocation across asset classes, which was met by profound physical and monetary action taken across the globe. Goldman Sachs met the needs of our clients relying on dynamic management of the firm's liquidity and balance sheet to provide complex risk and remediation, financing solutions, advice, and innovative thought leadership. Momentum remains strong into year-end as we produce record revenues for the fourth quarter of $11.7 billion resulting in record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. For the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $44.6 billion, our highest revenue production in more than a decade, which allowed us to generate meaningful operating leverage. We delivered a full year ROE of 11.1%, notwithstanding nearly 4 percentage point impact of litigation expense. This revenue growth was clearly driven by a larger opportunity set given the extraordinary activity throughout 2020. While industry wallet grew, we also took meaningful market share across businesses and geographies. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We maintained our leading global position and completed M&A as we have for 19 of the past 20 years, and strong lead table positions in underwriting, including a number one ranking in equity and equity linked offerings and a top-three ranking in high-yield. We delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities and solid client activity across our global platform, and grew market share across businesses and client groups. Our next-generation trading talent, now in positions of leadership, demonstrated strong risk management discipline and client focus in executing against an expanding opportunity set. In asset management we had record management and other fees as well as continued growth in our assets under supervision. We also generated solid revenues from our balance sheet investments driven by public marks and event driven gains on our portfolio. We continued our broader effort to reduce the balance sheet intensity of this business as we transition to more third-party investing. We continue to provide high quality advice to our wealth management clients producing record revenues and generated strong growth in our consumer business. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet and demonstrated agility in the deployment of capital to serve clients amid high levels of market volatility and evolving regulatory constraints. While we are cautiously optimistic, given improving macro trends, we recognize that the operating backdrop will continue to evolve. Although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the U.S., UK and other nations, there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risk. Let me underscore the progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally. I urge political leaders at all levels and across all jurisdictions to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan. In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed. Economists continue to anticipate a mixed outlook for near-term growth. The expectation is it will take until at least the second quarter to return to pre-pandemic levels of output. Our economists expect GDP growth this year of roughly 6.5% both globally and in the U.S., which would suggest a more rapid recovery. Though circumstances around COVID-19 remained fluid and we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weaknesses in the broader economy, looking ahead the extreme volatility of 2020 is unlikely to repeat given the government actions taken last year. Nevertheless, I am confident that Goldman Sachs will continue to benefit from the established wallet share gains made in 2020 across an expanding client set, particularly in investment banking and global markets and continue to develop more durable revenue sources across asset management and consumer wealth management. With that, let me turn to Page 2. In the 12 months since our Investor Day, we have made steady progress towards our medium-term goals and we remain confident that we will achieve these targets as well as our longer-term goal of mid teens or higher returns. Our 2020 ROE when adjusted to exclude the impact of litigation comfortably exceeds our 13% medium-term target. We are pleased with our progress on funding diversification as we grew deposits by $70 billion in 2020. While the Fed funds rate declined faster than the reduction in our deposit rates, we have since adjusted our pricing, which should allow us to achieve our funding optimization goals by 2022. We are making headway and realizing expense efficiencies throughout the organization and have achieved approximately half of the $1.3 billion initial target we presented at our Investor Day. We will continue to make progress from here and we will evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings. Finally, with respect to capital, our CET1 ratio stands at 14.7%. This positions us well to serve clients and accelerate capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter. We continue to believe that a 13% to 13.5% ratio is appropriate for the firm over the medium-term. We are encouraged by the results of the recent mid-cycle stress test. That said, we will continue to proactively reduce the stress capital intensity of our businesses, including through continued sales of our on balance sheet private equity investments. As John, Stephen and I have emphasized many times, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and being transparent with our stakeholders on our progress. We are tracking roughly 30 firm-wide KPIs and many additional business level metrics on a regular basis to measure our success as we execute on all aspects of our strategy. Let me now turn to Page 3. While last January's Investor Day seems distant given the events of the past year, the pillars of our strategic direction remain unchanged. Our strategy is simple; first, to grow and strengthen our existing franchise and capture higher wallet share across a wider client set; second, to diversify our products and services in order to build a more durable earnings stream, and third to operate more efficiently so that we can drive higher margins and returns across the organization. We are seeing early success in each category. Moving to Page 4, the strength of our firm's culture is the foundation for our performance as individuals in the firm and is central to the success that we achieved in 2020. Delivering the entire firm to our clients through our One Goldman Sachs approach is crucial to our mission and clients remain the center of everything we do. The investments we made to break down internal silos and motivate better collaboration across the firm have been critical and will continue to guide our approach going forward. Equally, core to our mission is delivering on our firm's purpose to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. This purpose is fundamental to our 10-year, $750 billion sustainable finance commitment that cuts across two broad pillars; climate transition and inclusive growth. During the year we have worked closely with our clients to deepen knowledge and expertise, develop capabilities, and accelerate commercial activity. We are delivering integrated ESG solutions across our client base, and I'm proud of the firm's leadership on this topic and optimistic about the benefits that these opportunities will bring to our clients. As we pursue these ambitious goals, we will also continue to focus on our people. Diversity is an imperative for our organization. For Goldman Sachs it is about bringing diverse people, perspectives and abilities together to best serve our stakeholders and fosters more creative thinking and supports the inclusive sustainable growth that is core to our long-term business strategy. While our recent progress is encouraging, including the most diverse campus analyst class ever to join the firm this past summer and improved diversity of our most recent partner and managing director classes, the events of the past year have reinforced how much further we have to go to enhance diversity and inclusion throughout the firm. This remains a personal priority for me and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable to make further advancements, including through our new aspirational goals to drive diverse hiring at more levels of the firm. Let me now take you through each of our four operating segments. I will start with investment banking, where we remain the advisor of choice for corporations around the world and 2020 is measured against the goals set out at our Investor Day, we maintained our number one ranking and announced and completed M&A and equity and equity linked offerings. We also ranked in the top-four for wallet share in global debt underwriting through the third quarter. We spoke last January about our aim to grow share in our core business. We began to execute on this goal in 2020 as announced M&A deal count was up along with our equity underwriting wallet share. On our footprint expansion efforts we have met our Investor Day target for client coverage. We generated in excess of $800 million of revenue in 2020 from this client set and we expect this to be an important source of growth going forward. Across the business we have added approximately 2700 net new clients since 2017 and we will continue to add new clients to sustain this space. We are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for investment banking given the robust activity levels in the capital markets and the elevated strategic activity on the back of improving CO [ph] confidence reflected in our near record backlog at the end of the year. We are also pleased with the early success of our transaction banking platform with which since its launch last June has attracted roughly 225 corporate clients and nearly $30 billion of deposits and is well-positioned to drive growth and more durable revenues for the firm. A combination of our [indiscernible] product offering, strong client receptivity, and tailwinds created by the macroeconomic environment, drove deposit growth ahead of expectations. As we work to deliver greater functionality to clients and continue their on-boarding, we will convert more of these deposits to operation providing increased funding utility to the firm. We also continue to look for innovative ways to expand the reach of our platform to new clients as we did with our recent partnership with Stripe which embeds our transaction banking payment and deposit solutions directly into Stripes' platform, making these products available to its millions of small business customers. Let me now turn to Page 6. In 2020 our global markets business posted its strongest net revenues in a decade, exceeding the return targets laid out for the business at Investor Day. Global markets is a business that many believe should have been downsized when John, Stephen, and I took our seats. While it's only a single year, the performance of the business in 2020 is an early validation of our decision to stay the course. Our teams worked diligently to serve our clients through the challenges of 2020 providing liquidity across asset classes in a mediating risk and engaging instruction solutions, while also supporting significant volumes across expanding digital platforms. We also advanced on our Investor Day objective of moving into a top-three position with more of the top-100 institutional clients. We are now in the top-three across 64 of these firms, up from 51 a year ago. We gained 120 basis points of wallet share through the third quarter of 2020, which we intend to maintain through our deepened client relationships, superior risk intermediation, and ongoing investment in technology platforms. We set a goal in January to increase our client financing activity. A record six financing revenues were 2020 demonstrate our ability to meet this target. Additionally, we continue to strengthen our prime business where we closed the year with record balances, the result of a multiyear investment in platform enhancements and other client oriented initiatives particularly in the Quant space. Finally, while we saw meaningful revenue growth in global markets, we remain focused on operating efficiencies. We achieved roughly $400 million in expense efficiencies last year and allocated $1.25 billion of capital in that business to more accretive opportunities, both ahead of schedule. Across any level of industry wallet, the progress that we have made in global markets has improved. The business is structural return profile. Let me now turn to Page 7. Our asset management business experienced solid performance in 2020 marked by continued growth in assets under supervision driving record management and other fees. Our status as one of the world's leading global asset managers has served us well during this volatile period. Our Asset management business provides clients with offerings across the spectrum, from liquidity to alternatives and we will continue to grow this business opportunistically by serving our clients' needs and differentiating our offerings with holistic advice, investment solutions, and portfolio implementation. We are progressing well towards our longer term objectives of $250 billion of growth in traditional equity and fixed income products and $100 billion of net inflows to alternatives. To that end we spoke at Investor Day about growing our third-party alternatives business and we are pleased with our early achievements. We have raised approximately $40 billion in commitments to date across asset classes, including private equity, private credit, and real estate. This is good progress toward our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising over five years. Additionally, we are encouraged by the expanding number of institutions that are investing with Goldman Sachs. Many pension funds and international institutions participating in recent funding offering are new investing clients to the firm. As we shift towards a greater emphasis on third-party funds, we also continue to work to optimize the capital consumption of our asset management business. To that end, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of growth equity investments in 2020, with a related $2 billion of expected lower capital. We will continue to advance this sell down process in 2021 and beyond to achieve the objectives we set out at our Investor Day. Importantly, as we highlighted at Investor Day, incentive fees on portfolio remain unrecognized until investments are sold and fund return thresholds are achieved. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees currently stand at $1.8 billion. Turning to Page 8, we made meaningful advancements this year in growing our consumer and wealth management segment, particularly in expanding our customer base, improving [ph] our technology platform and leveraging our corporate franchise. We remain committed to delivering tailored advice and simple and transparent financial solutions to our individual clients across the wealth spectrum and our goals here remain integral to our strategic priorities. Our wealth management franchise remains a crown jewel for the firm. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.8 billion, as our clients largely remained invested through uncertain market conditions. And our private wealth management business this success has long been built on the strength, depth and trust of client relationships, which became even more relevant as COVID-19 limited face-to-face interaction. Throughout this period our private wealth advisors have continued to maintain high levels of client engagement and deliver trusted advice. While the environment has caused us to slow some of our hiring efforts in this area, we remain committed to the growth potential of this franchise. We also continue to expand our high net worth platform through Ayco and personal financial management, our rebranded United Capital business. Our Ayco platform achieved its annual goal of bringing more than 30 new corporate clients onto the platform in 2020, as corporates of all types increasingly looked to Ayco for financial planning and wellness solutions. We remain well-positioned to meet this ongoing need given Ayco's broad spectrum of offerings as well as connectivity with our investment banking franchise and our new personal financial management capabilities. We have already begun to see significant synergy as a result of these advantages with over 4000 referrals in 2020 representing over $7 billion of AUS opportunity across these channels. Moving to Page 9, I want to provide some additional detail on our consumer business, which continues to perform well and deliver strong growth. The pandemic has reaffirmed our view that traditional banking has not kept up with the way people live their lives today and The Goldman Sachs is uniquely placed to step into this gap. We've had early success launching online savings, lending and credit card and we are now moving to the next phase of our growth plan taking us from a series of singular products to a more comprehensive offering. We are particularly excited about the launch of Marcus invest platform in the U.S. this quarter, which for the first time brings the investing expertise of Goldman Sachs directly to mass affluent customers. Following our U.S. launch we plan to expand to the UK in the second half of the year. Marcus invest will offer individuals the ability to invest as little as $1000 in our proprietary asset allocation strategies with options ranging from index funds to ESG focused ETF. Digital investing features will be integrated into the Marcus app and website and will combine the accessibility, simplicity and transparency of Marcus with our leading investment advisory capabilities. In addition, our new digital checking offering also scheduled for launch this year will deliver an enhanced customer experience that is simpler, and more transparent than what traditional banks have historically offered, providing smart money management tools that help consumers take control of their financial lives. As we grow, we will not only serve customers directly through the Marcus platform, but we will also serve customers through our growing partnership channels. In 2020 we launched four new partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, JetBlue and AARP, while following our first partnership with Apple. We also recently announced a second cobranded credit card with General Motors. Now this is a sign of our ability to be the banking partner of choice for leading corporations across a variety of industries. Our partners value our scale, innovation, engineering prowess, robust infrastructure, regulatory status, and importantly the power of the Goldman Sachs brand. The opportunities set here is very large, with each partner reaching tens of millions of individuals through their existing customer bases. With that as background, let me also comment on 2020 consumer performance, which exceeded our expectations, but which also has implications for our financials as we go forward. We proactively adjusted our strategy beginning in March as the impact of COVID-19 and the evolving market conditions began to take shape. We timed underwriting standards to reduce risk deliberately slowing our consumer loan growth across both unsecured loans and Apple card. Given the economic outlook, we also significantly grew our reserves for potential future losses. At the same time, we continued to raise deposits at a pace meaningfully higher than we had expected, as clients remained attractive to the value of our products and the strength of our brand. Taken together, our pretax loss in consumer, excluding reserve build was reduced versus 2019 levels and lower than our expectations for 2020. Looking forward, we have a clear opportunity to achieve breakeven excluding reserves for our existing products set, including checking and investing in 2022. That achievement would be one year later than initially anticipated due to business adjustments driven by COVID. The 2021 pretax loss for our consumer business, excluding the impact of reserves is likely going to be higher and look more like what we had initially expected for 2020. This is driven by lower value on deposits, tighter credit standards, and additionally the investment in our new General Motors credit card. Beyond 2021, we will continue to invest where appropriate, and opportunities to build additional functionality with our digital bank, as well as to pursue further growth in our partnership channel. In terms of broader functionality, we may look to develop additional products, driving more comprehensive customer experience over time. These investments if pursued may delay our planned breakeven for the business. I want to emphasize, however that should we choose to invest in additional products to broaden our consumer capabilities, it will not affect our ability to meet our enterprise level targets. With respect to partnerships, these opportunities with corporate clients of the firm allow us to commercially engage with a broader consumer population, and are designed to build on the platform based architecture that we have built for our proprietary markets business. Just as we did with Apple card, our intent is to develop differentiated products and service offerings that are embedded in our partners' ecosystems and tailored for the spending, borrowing and investing needs of their customers. From an economic perspective, these opportunities are designed to materially reduce our customer acquisition costs and leverage the embedded cost base of our systems. Furthermore, partnerships we seek to pursue offer the firm potential for mid-teens returns at scale. Each partnership is intended to extend beyond a single product and bring scale to our business on favorable economic terms. Goldman Sachs has a history of building businesses with a long-term orientation. Our investment and our consumer business will continue to be dynamic and appropriately sized to support our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and in the interim, it will not prevent us from reaching our medium term firm wide goals. Before I close, let me share that I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made in 2020, which was a transformative year for Goldman Sachs. Our success could not have been achieved without the extraordinary efforts of our people who continue to put clients at the center of everything we do. I am humbled by the level of commitment I see across our organization every day, knowing many of the personal and professional challenges our people are navigating. As we look forward, I know there will be further challenges, but I am optimistic about the potential for Goldman Sachs in the coming years. I believe in our strategic plan, and our leadership team, and our culture, and in the raw talent of our people. Taken together, these attributes will better enable us to achieve higher and more sustainable returns for our shareholders. Let me now turn it over to Stephen to review funding, expenses and capital as a part of the Investor Day update. So, Christian, I'll start with that. Good morning and thank you for the question. I -- and we tried to highlight this in the update that we're working to go from a product structure, we handful of products to a much more integrated offering for our customers. And so when you ask about comparison to some of the some of the fintechs, I just say the Fin-techs are much more narrow in scope, in terms of what they offer, and don't have the broad capabilities that we have. And we're betting and we're expanding on for our clients. So just in the context of, the two examples that you gave, and highlighting so fire chime, when you think about spending across both checking and credit cards, when you think about borrowing across credit cards and loans, and you think about savings, and also investing and the investment capabilities that we have as a wealth manager, we have a much broader integrated offering and we continue to get feedbacks of the state-of-the-art product platform. And the digital applications that we have, are really excellent by any standards. So we're going to continue to move forward with that long-term strategy. I don't really have a comment on the valuation of these businesses, although I'm watching with everyone else, and I'm looking at what we have, the number of clients we have, the number of customers the size of our business, the scale that we have as we continue to move forward and I am looking at that opportunity, the growth that we have, and if people like those businesses. I think at some point in time, they should, like and value our business, more fulsomely but we'll continue to execute and wait on that. We really like our model of having a proprietary platform for Marcus, but then also, given our corporate relationships, the potential for partnerships is very, very strong for us. And I think you saw that in our execution this year, by adding four more partnerships by capturing the GM Card, and I think you'll continue to see us do more on this front. And so we feel good about it, but as I said in my comments, we're taking a long term view in what we're doing and none of this will affect our medium term targets that we're working toward at the end of 2022, gets a lot of attention, but it won't affect our targets. Sure. So NII Christian, as you noted, grew, it was at $1.4 billion for the firm in the quarter. That was driven largely by balance sheet growth, notably in growth markets, and most especially in prime. So our prime balances were up. The challenging aspect for us and the reference made in the context of funding is that our liquidity grew over the quarter, we were slower to adjust, particularly on the retail deposit side pricing of our liabilities and so we didn't capture quite what we wanted. Obviously, we've now brought rates down and so, we're able to sort of allocate that cost out to the business. So liabilities are important. NII expanded because of balance sheet and impact overall net funding costs. And so that's the reference, if you will, to the headwinds notwithstanding prime balance is growing, funding costs were higher than we wanted, that notwithstanding NII grew because of overall balance sheet growth over the course of the quarter in prime and by virtue overall of moving to a higher G-SIB, in the context of meeting client demands. Sure, I mean, I think that first, obviously, what we've been speaking about within the asset management business and the growth of third party alternatives and, forward durability of those revenues, is one area. There's obviously growth in some of the growth initiatives, including transaction banking, as well as what we're doing on the consumer side. And so you'll continue to see pickup and share pickup. None of those are necessarily meant to be compensating factors for what could be a shortfall in global markets. I think within global markets, we will buffer structurally speaking, what might be a less impressive opportunity set on the forward relative to 2020 by virtue of what we've done around market share gains, and equally, what we're doing around the cost base. And I'd say also, if you look within the global markets business, what we're seeing in terms of the growth in low touch, high volume activity around Marquee and the digital platforms, particularly growth in portfolio trading across, I think all of those will spell sort of improved performance as a general matter notwithstanding the market. Finally, I'd point out that the investment banking footprint continues to expand. And that too will provide an offset to the extent that again, the assumption to your question that we see lower opportunity as an industry matter within the trading or global markets business? Sure, so on capital, look, our capital philosophy really remains unchanged, which is we look for opportunities for creative return on investment in capital in the business and equally meeting, you know, client demands that are there. Separate from that, it's my expectation that we will hit our first quarter repurchase expectations, which based on the calculation of the Fed will be about $1.9 billion in the quarter plus neutralizing equity based compensation expense. And so we will fulfill that in the first quarter. I'd also repeat a comment I made in the prepared remarks is that we'll continue to reevaluate our dividend in the context of the shape and form of the business being more durable going forward. Obviously, that's not a first quarter proposition, given the Fed rules, but you can certainly rely on the repurchase expectations and our fulfillment of them. In terms of asset management, this is all about an overall reduction in the balance sheet intensity of that business. It is being mindful of revenue in the near term. It is driving down on balance sheet investing, and moving that into third party activity, doing that across more sleeves with more clients of the firm. And I think that will, continue to take down our capital. And I suspect based on the progress we made in 2020, of taking 2 billion on 4 billion of sales. And as I mentioned, our forward view on what's, within line of sight, incremental capital will come out, at or better than the expectations we carried at the Investor Day itself. Okay, thanks. Thanks, Steve, I'll start. And I appreciate the question. And I'll just, to take your framing, you said historically, at times of severe stress, you've been a dealer of choice. And you really -- you make that statement by going back and looking at one window, which was the financial crisis, and there's no question in the financial crisis, we had very, very significant share gains. But I would highlight that one of the reasons that we had very significant share gains during the financial crisis is that a lot of the people that would be in our core competitive set, were in a position of very, very weak, structural financial performance, at the time, and it definitely inhibited their ability to intermediate with clients. So one of the things I recall hearing at that time, is a lot of firms did not show up during the financial crisis. And we benefited from that. I think, hopefully, we benefited for other reasons. But there was a different component. We have a very, very different situation right now. Banks have been a source of strength during the pandemic. All of our competitors have showed up in spades and yet we have very, very significant share gains. Now, maybe some of that is a branded reputation that were a dealer of choice during the pandemic, but I would argue a bigger impact in really affecting how we perform and I've heard this consistently from our global markets clients, is a change strategically in our approach over the last few years, in terms of how we're facing clients, or one GS approach and what we're trying to do. We talked a little bit in the strategic update and talking about how for the first time over the last couple of years, we have a targeted approach, and evaluating our wallet share with the top 100 clients, seems relatively straightforward. But this is not something we had ever done historically. And that we advanced that considerably over the course of 2020, by going from top-three with 51 of the clients to top three of 64 of the clients. We have a much more client centric approach. I got a lot of feedback calls this year from our clients, noticing what they said was a very different approach in the way Goldman Sachs interacted with them now then versus 10 years ago. And so I would argue across the platform, that orientation is helping a while share [Ph] gains. Now, I'm not going to sit here and say that in a different environment, when the world is more even, and we're not in a crisis, that there's not going to be a flattening. In fact, I'd say that across all our businesses. We tend to outperform in investment banking during times of stress, and the market share gains collapse a little bit in times when everything is very, very easy. And so I'm sure there'll be some of that. But we have a very, very clear strategy, or a very clear client centric strategy that is different. And I think it's led to enhanced wallet share gains. I'd also say and we highlighted this in the context of looking at that business. This goes back to one of the earlier questions, we've made structural improvements, not just in the client approach, but also in the cost base of that business and in our capital allocation in that business. And the results are even if we have a different available client wallet, we have a structurally more profitable business on a go forward basis. And so that's the way we're thinking about that. I hope that's helpful. I'll start on that. I'll let Stephen answer the second point about the second point with respect to the 650. But I just what, Steven, I think the way you should understand that we're thinking about this is we've been re-underwriting the firm, and trying to do what we can across the platform to operate more efficiently. We set out a target on or Invest Day. And we had a very clear view on the path to that target. When we said that a year ago at our Investor Day, and we're marching through and we're executing on that. With respect to other opportunities, we continue to evaluate other opportunities. And it would be hard pressed to say that we didn't learn a lot this year in the context of the operating environment, that we've looked that we've been operating this year. And so that's giving us new insights into other places across the platform where things can be more efficient. In addition, our business like lots of businesses is digitizing. And in the context of that it's allowing us to digitize processes that historically we've used, we've executed with more manual, personnel sort to speak. So we're going to continue to focus on that. We do think there are other opportunities, when we have more to say to be more specific, with our continued focus on transparency will give you more specifics. Hey, Jeff. I am coming through now? Well, it's, I'll take this at a high level, Jeff. Obviously, it's hard to when I wouldn't speculate, going out for multiple years, but what I would say is we're still in the middle of a pandemic, there's still an enormous amount of stimulus. And there's also because of the acceleration of digital trends, there are lots of businesses and lots of CEOs that are rethinking or re underwriting strategically how they're positioned. So corporate activity, and therefore capital markets activity in that context is high. Certainly, as we head into 2021, there are a lot of indicators, that that's going to continue in 2021, certainly in the near term. And so our expectation is, certainly in the near term, that activity will continue. To the degree that we get to a more normalized environment, the degree that there is a backing off of fiscal activity to the degree over time, there's a more normalization of monetary policy, that obviously can affect this activity level. But that's not something we'd expect in the near term and 2021. So at the moment, pipeline backlogs, things that we can see, continue to look robust. That doesn't mean that we're saying that we expect to repeat of everything we saw in 2020. And there certainly are different parts of both the banking and the Marcus business that I think were elevated in 2020. And our expectations for 2021 are not as robust as they weren't 2020, but certainly more robust than they were in 2019. Sure. So, a couple of comments. Backlog levels, as we stated, are up quarter-over-quarter. And I'd say that activity levels broadly across the banking platform are up. Certainly SPAC activities contributing to it. But strategic corporate M&A is up meaningfully. And what I say is that was a real kind of doldrums as the pandemic hit, and people were reorganizing, but as we came out in the summer and people started to kind of look through the tunnel, and get a sense of where things were going. Strategic activity, with corporates really picked up and that's contributed, meaningfully also and that has nothing really to do with the SPAC ecosystem. On SPACs Mike, I'll say a couple of things. And there's no question that, the growth of SPACs as a product that definitely affected activity levels. But there are a few things that I'd say, just to try to frame it. SPACs were a little bit more than 50% of IPO activity this year. But when you look at IPO activity, IPO activity for us, for example, was on a volume basis, about 17% of our equity volume. So we did about $20 billion of IPO lead table against $115 billion of equity lead table, 17%. If you look at our IPO fees, all IPOs, SPAC and non-SPAC, and again, SPACs was say around 50%. But if you look at our IPO fees, our IPO fees were less than 40% of all our equity underwriting fees and then SPACs would be a subset of that. Now to your point, it also creates an ecosystem around capital rising around advisory services, et cetera. And so there's no question that that ecosystem at the moment is creating a tailwind for some of these capital market activities. So a couple of other things I'd say, first, we generally strive to be number one in the lead tables. We do not strive to be number one, in the SPAC lead tables, we are very well, we're very active, we're very thoughtful about our sponsors and the business that we take on. And just looking at last year, if you look at the number of SPACs that were done and the lead table leaders, the number one and number two firms did about 33% more deals than we did, representatives, I think of some of the things that came to us that we turned away. So we're participating, but we're trying to participate. But picking what we think are the best situations, I do think SPACs is a good use case, versus a traditional IPO, and advantages for sellers and for investors and looking at this ecosystem. But the ecosystem is not without flaws. I think it's still evolving. I think the incentive system is still evolving. One of the things we're watching very, very closely is the incentives of the sponsors, and also the incentives of somebody that selling. And while I think these activity levels continue to be very robust, and that they do continue as we head into 2021 continue to be very, very robust. I do not think this is sustainable in the medium term. And there'll be something that will, in some way, shape or form, bring the activity levels down over a period of time. But we're watching it closely. And it's something that our clients continue to be very, very interested in. There are lots of companies that go public via SPAC that could also go public and a traditional IPO. And there's some companies that go public and a SPAC that probably couldn't go public through the standardized process of a traditional IPO. And all of those are things that the market will have to less with. And one of the things I certainly think is the case is you have something here it's a good capital markets innovation. But like many innovations, there's a point in time as they start, where they have a tendency, maybe to go a little bit too far, and then need to be pulled back or rebalanced in some way. And that's something my guess is we'll see over the course of 2021 or 2022, with SPACs. So, two points, I think, Mike to the questions if I got it right. With, I'm not going to speculate on a forecast on a specific forecast around capital markets activity. But I do think your statement is fair in terms of the way I framed it, which is capital markets activity is starting \u201821 very robust. Based on the data we have, it seems like it will continue to be relatively robust in 2021. But we don't expect it to be at the same level that it was in 2020. With respect to your second question, I assume you're asking about global markets wallet share. Were you asking about banking and markets wallet share? Mike? Mike? Global market you're talking about? Okay. So I talked earlier on the call, about the way over the last two and a half years, we've evolved our strategy. And I think the strategy we have for our global markets business is a good strategy for Goldman Sachs. I like our position, and we've consolidated share. Why have we done that? We've done that because we have a very client centric approach, a very holistic one Goldman Sachs approach. We have a much more targeted wallet share approach through the largest institutional clients that we interact within that business and that has allowed us to strengthen our position. And so, I can't go back and make all the direct comparisons that everybody wants, but I think there are a lot of things. And I stated some of this earlier that are very different about what we saw coming out of the financial crisis and what evolved versus where we're operating today. So the wallet may change, but I think we've made material strides and strengthened our position in global markets, and I expect us to hold a number of those wallet share gains and we're very, very focused on making sure we do. Well, there's a lot there in what you said, Brennan, but I'm going to repeat something that I've said over and over again. We're focused on building an integrated digital platform in the consumer space, I think over the last four plus years, we're off to a very good start, we've given you lots of metrics, we can track that progress. And we continue to roll out on the investments that we're making, including, as we said, you'll see invest this quarter, Marcus invest this quarter, and you'll see checking during the course of the year. With respect to M&A opportunities broadly, whether it's to expand our consumer offering, whether it's the grower asset management business, whether it's to expand our wealth management capability, we're always looking for ways to accelerate our strategic growth plans, if something came along that helped us accelerate or advance our strategic growth plan. And we thought that it was a good fit strategically, and we thought, we could acquire it and integrate it attractively, then we would do it, just as we did with United Capital, but the bar to do something significant is extremely high. And it's not an easy thing to do. So, we'll continue to look for things that can accelerate our growth plan. But we're going to continue to invest in these businesses. And I think the important thing for you to note is that we have a lot of confidence that these can be sizable businesses at scale, that are accretive to Goldman Sachs's return, even if we do not do something significant and organically. Yes. So Gerard, I think it's a good question. I appreciate it. And I think there's a huge advantage. And so, putting aside some of the things I'm talking about, that are strategically based on our conscious decisions, we happen to be, one of the handful of firms that is global at scale on a market leader, in these global markets and investment banking businesses, and I think it is increasingly difficult to compete in these businesses, unless you're global and at scale, unless you have the capacity to make very, very significant technology investments into platforms to better connect with your clients. And so there has been a consolidation of wallet share into the leading players across these platforms. And we continue to be one of those players. And I think that position has only grown and then been strengthened. I also would point out that we don't just have scale broadly, we've stayed committed, as I highlighted earlier in my remarks to all the different silos and asset classes across our markets business. So you think about the many asset classes across markets, we benefited because we stayed committed to commodities, and we have a more fulsome offering for our clients. And there was a real benefit to that this year. So, I think there's no question, the leading firms have a strong competitive advantage. I think to maintain that competitive advantage and have reasonable margins, given the capital requirements, the technology requirements, the regulatory requirements, being in a leadership position is much more important today than it was 15, 20, 25 years ago. That's fair. Well, it's interesting, I mean, I think that we should take them each on their own. In transaction banking, I think what we have hit is a resonating chord with our clients about the nature of what we've built, meaning we've built a new and improved digital Interface by which corporations can manage their operational flows. And that has been a refreshing change to kind of legacy platforms that have been there. I say that not as just simply an observer, but also a consumer of that service, where Goldman Sachs is using its own platform. And I think that will continue, in part because operational flows across corporate's will continue, almost notwithstanding what plays out in the context of the market movement. Overall, the consumer side may be a different proposition. Now, it depends on the perspective you take with respect to, GDP growth, and what happens with rates and the like. But I think, as David has said, on the consumer side, we are playing for the long term, that is building relationship with 10s of millions of consumers and pivoting in 2021, to a broader, more comprehensive platform that I think will attract more consumers to the platform, not simply because there's an attractiveness to the deposit rate or to rate on lending, but because we'll offer a more comprehensive package of investing and checking, and will become a more reliable primary bank, to more consumers. And I think that'll play out again, kind of notwithstanding where the markets otherwise take us on some of the more capital markets intensive activity."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made-to-date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium term funding goals remains a significant source of forward value for the firm. As you will recall, our ambition is to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue uplift over the medium term from growth in deposits, enhancement to our asset liability management and the optimization of our liquidity pool. Along with the broader industry, we experienced material shift in the rate environment in 2020. With Fed funds declining over 150 basis points, the relative value of our deposits remained positive, but lower than projected at Investor Day. What's more, since we are modestly asset sensitive as a firm, our assets re-priced more quickly than our liabilities. As 2020 progressed, we were able to adjust our deposit pricing to reflect the broader downward movement in rates. While we did not achieve savings in 2020 with greater volume, and now updated pricing in the consumer channel, we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion run rate savings target. We also remain well positioned to capture further savings, as we expand our offerings in markets, deepen our client relationships, and rely less on pricing as a lever for customer acquisition. While the focus has been on consumer deposits, our total deposits grew by $70 billion in 2020 across multiple strategic channels, including particularly strong flows in transaction banking. Importantly, deposits comprised approximately 50% of our total unsecured funding base at year end, in line with our medium term target. As the recent environment has helped accelerate our deposit gathering efforts, growth will likely be more moderate in the near term, in light of our entity funding needs. We continue to grow assets within our bank entities, where we have traditionally lagged our peers. We now have approximately one quarter of the firm wide balance sheet, held in the firm's bank entities, versus roughly 15% in 2017. We have also made improvements in our asset liability management that we continue to employ a conservative funding approach focused on term and diversification. Let me now move to Page 11, and expenses. We remain on track to achieve the target laid out at Investor Day of $1.3 billion in expense savings over the medium term, accomplishing approximately half of our goal over the past year. The achievement of these efficiencies has enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020. Our experience over the past 12 months has given us even greater confidence in several of the key elements of this plan. In particular, we are already seeing important benefits from our investment in automation and consolidation of platforms, including increased straight-through-processing rates and reduced cost per trade. In addition, we continue to generate efficiencies from structural adjustments to our employee base through our front-to-back realignment, location strategy and evaluation of pyramid [ph] structure. On the non-compensation front, consolidation of offices in London and Bengaluru [ph] focused on transaction based expenses and more centralized expense management processes have all contributed to early success. The remote work environment has also catalyzed an increased focus on our location strategy. Last January, we expected that 40% of our employees would ultimately work from one of our strategic locations, and we will continue to evaluate the potential for that number to grow over time. We will also look to expand into new strategic locations around the globe, as well as consolidate our footprint, where appropriate in keeping with our evolving business mix. Now turning to Page 12, and capital. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We seek to deploy capital on accretive terms, both in our incumbent businesses, and in areas of growth investment and otherwise return excess to our shareholders. While our ratios initially declined in early 2020, as we committed capital to support clients, navigating the pandemic and we received an SCB result in the 2020 CCAR process that was higher than anticipated. Our standardized CET1 ratio at year end was 14.7% accomplished through strong earnings, lower capital return and disciplined balance sheet management. Importantly, we are pleased with the results of the recent interim stress test and we intend to resume share repurchases this quarter. As in the past, and as permitted, we will continue to reassess our dividend commensurate with the strategic direction of our business. We will be dynamic in our approach, both to reflect proactive steps to reduce capital consumption in the business and as a function of capital requirements more in line with the results of the interim CCAR examination. As such, we continue to target the CET1 ratio of 13% to 13.5% over the medium term, which will inform our capital deployment decisions. As we look ahead, we remain engaged with the Federal Reserve to improve stress modeling in CCAR. As David mentioned earlier, we have already sold or announced the sale of $4 billion in assets with $2 billion of related capital reduction. That said, in the first quarter, we will adjust our equity attribution across our segments to more appropriately reflect the firm's higher SCB based on the results of CCAR 2020. Given the higher stress loss intensity of our equity positions, the capital attributed to asset management will be larger, and so will the capital reduction associated with our intended sell down of assets. This change will not impact our stated medium term targets, and in fact we intend to increase the size and accelerate the pace of asset sales beyond that anticipated at Investor Day, so as to further reduce the capital intensity of the segment beyond our original ambition. Speaking more broadly, there are several key drivers affecting capital requirements for the firm overall. First, our stress capital buffer which we expect to improve as I have noted. Second, our G-SIB surcharge, where we ended the year at 3% to meet client demands, the impact of which will take effect in 2023. And lastly, our management buffer, which we plan to run between 50 and 100 basis points, accounting for volatility and client activity. Before turning to our earnings report, let me finish on Page 13 with a slide that David first presented at Investor Day one year ago. Our strategic direction is guided by these objectives. We are pleased with our progress to date in strengthening our existing businesses, growing our new businesses, and operating the firm more efficiently. Early success in 2020, however, does not diminish our focus on forward execution. We have worked to do from here, and will continue to drive more durable earnings and enhanced returns for our shareholders. In all cases, we will continue our commitment to transparency and accountability and we look forward to updating you further on our progress in the year ahead. With that, let me now switch gears to our separate earnings presentation to cover the fourth quarter, and full year results. First to quickly recap our financial results on Page 1. Fourth quarter net revenues were $11.7 billion, resulting in $44.6 billion for the full year, a growth rate of 22%. In the fourth quarter we delivered net earnings of $4.5 billion and record quarterly earnings per share of $12.8. As David mentioned, the firm delivered full year ROE of 11.1%. Litigation burdened our full year returns by nearly 400 basis points. Turning to Page two and our individual segments. As we noted earlier, Investment Banking delivered outstanding performance in 2020. In the fourth quarter net revenues were $2.6 billion. Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, more than double third quarter levels, reflecting growth in the number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on over 350 transactions that closed during the quarter, representing over $1 trillion of deal volume, roughly $150 billion ahead of our closest peer. Equity underwriting produced a record $1.1 billion of revenue in the quarter, as industry volumes remained elevated, and we continue to gain market share. This just drove record full year revenues in equity underwriting of $3.4 billion, supported by $115 billion of deal volume across nearly 600 transactions. In an extraordinary year for equity issuance we participated in 120 traditional IPOs, 70 private transactions, and a number of SPAC [ph] IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in innovative forms. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $526 million down 8% sequentially, reflecting lower investment grade transactions partially offset by strength in leverage finance. Full year revenues of $2.7 billion were a near record and up 26% versus 2019. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our number three high yield lead table ranking for the year. Looking forward as David mentioned, our investment banking backlog is at near record levels, significantly higher versus the third quarter and a year ago. Client dialogues remain robust and we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FICC and Healthcare. Fourth quarter net revenues from corporate lending were negative $119 million, reflecting roughly $250 million of hedged losses against the relationship loan book as credit spreads tightened. Recall that for risk management purposes, we maintain single name hedges on certain large relationship lending commitments. Of note, in relationship lending, the total notional drawn were funded on revolvers is now back down to pre-COVID levels. Moving to global markets, on Page 3, net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% versus last year. For the full year global markets generated $21.2 billion of net revenues, up 43% versus 2019, driven by stronger FICC and equities intermediation performance. This represents the highest yearly revenues for this segment in a decade. Turning to FICC on Page 4, fourth quarter FICC net revenues were $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. our growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues, where we saw increased client activity, while FICC financing revenues were roughly flat. Three out of five FICC intermediation businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength and breadth of our business. In credit, we saw significantly better performance helped by elevated activity, and market share gains, driven in particular by outperformance in portfolio trading, notably across our digital platforms. In commodities, net revenues were driven by stronger performance across most assets, including metals and agricultural products. In currencies, net revenues rose on solid performance in emerging markets, as volatility rose across most currency pairs. In mortgages and rates, net revenues were lower year-on-year, so client activity remained solid, particularly in mortgages around CMBS and mortgage intermediation and in rates activity remained elevated as a consequence of a number of macro events, including the U.S. election and COVID and the overall reflationary theme. Moving over to equities, net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, up 40% versus a year ago. Full year revenues of $9.6 billion were the highest since 2009. Fourth quarter equities intermediation net revenues of $1.8 billion reflected stronger results in derivatives across all regions, as well as higher cash revenues helped by strong performance in program trading. Equities financing revenues of $591 million were down 19% year-over-year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, as David mentioned, client balances rose to record levels. Moving to asset management on Page 5, our asset management activities produced net revenues of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, asset management generated net revenues of $8 billion, down from a strong 2019 as equity and debt investment performance was challenged in the first half of 2020. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $733 million, up 10% versus a year ago on higher average assets, contributing to record full-year net revenues of $2.8 billion. Across the asset management segment, our AUS stood at a record $1.5 trillion at year end. Our equity investments generated $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter on gains on our public and private investments. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated roughly $745 million in gains from investments, including Caspi [ph] and Sprout. And on our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated net gains of approximately $775 million from various positions, substantially all of which were driven by events, including corporate actions, such as fundraisings, capital market activities, and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $250 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $637 million on revenues from net interest income and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. On Page 6, we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. On equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified, with segment loans largely secured. On Page 7, turning to consumer and wealth management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter. Full year net revenues were $6 billion, up 15% versus a year ago, driven by higher management and other fees and strong consumer banking growth. For the quarter, wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of $1 billion. Full year revenues of $4.8 billion rose 10% year-over-year, and assets under supervision rose to a record $615 billion at year end. Total client assets in this segment exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020. Consumer banking revenues were $347 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to full year revenues of $1.2 billion, which rose 40% year-over-year, and we're diversified across lending, card and savings. Consumer deposits remained stable during the quarter, despite an additional rate reduction, ending the year at $97 billion across the U.S. and U.K., up $37 billion versus last year. Funded consumer loan balances were $8 billion, of which $4 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $4 billion from credit card lending. Importantly, the credit behavior of our loan and credit card portfolio outperformed our expectations. The portfolio benefited from improved underwriting, as well as the consequences of our consumer assistant plants. Next, let's turn to Page 8, for firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS rose to over $2.1 trillion during the quarter and are up nearly $290 billion versus a year ago. The sequential change was driven by $17 billion of long term inflows, $6 billion of liquidity inflows and $86 billion of market appreciation. On Page 9, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up versus a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet, particularly in global markets, as well as the benefit from credit card balances, and repricing of deposits in consumer and wealth management. Equally, this activity is reflective of the decision to allow our G-SIB surcharge to increase to 3%. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $116 billion, up $4 billion sequentially, largely driven by modest growth in loans and consumer and wealth management and real estate warehouse lending. Our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $293 million, roughly flat sequentially and down versus a year ago. The quarter's provisions were driven primarily by continued growth in lending in our consumer business and wholesale impairments, offset by some reserve leases driven by improving macroeconomic conditions. Given our announced partnership with General Motors and the planned acquisition of the current loan receivables from Capital One, we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of associated provisions in the first quarter. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was flat versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $103 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.7% and for consumer loans of 15.9%. For the full year, we recognized firm-wide net charge offs of $907 million, resulting in an annualized net charge off ratio of 0.9% up 30 basis points versus last year. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our efficiency ratio was 65%, which includes a nearly 800 basis point impact from litigation expense. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to compensating top talent. While compensation expenses were up 8% year-over-year relative to growth in revenue net of provisions for credit losses of 17% our full year compensation ratio is at a record low, reflecting the operating leverage in our franchise. As we have said in the past, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses. Our non-compensation expense, our costs for the full year 2020 rose 25% versus last year, excluding litigation or full year operating expenses grew by only 8% inclusive of investments spent across the business and higher variable expenses associated with transaction volumes. Growth was partially offset by efficiency savings, and lower travel and entertainment costs due to the circumstances of COVID-19. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 18.7% for the fourth quarter and 24.2% for the year, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. We continue to expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21% under the current tax regime. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 11, as previously discussed, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% at the end of the fourth quarter, under the standardized approach up 20 basis points sequentially. Earnings were largely offset by higher RWAs as we stepped in to serve our clients. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 50 basis points to 13.4%. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, rising 3% versus last quarter as we deployed resources to facilitate client activity, particularly within our prime brokerage business. We maintain very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $298 billion, reflecting the current backdrop. On the liability side, our total deposits were roughly flat at $260 billion as planned roll-off of higher costs brokered deposits was partially offset by modest growth in consumer, private bank and transaction banking deposits. In conclusion, our strong fourth quarter and 2020 results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, strong risk discipline and flexibility in our balance sheet deployment. David, John and I are proud of our people for their efforts this year in serving our clients and delivering on our strategic goals, especially given the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to furthering our progress on our medium and long term targets and we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues and higher returns for our shareholders over time.  With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions. Hey, Glenn its Steven. No, there's nothing more to read. We were just on this slide, reiterating the medium term targets that we had set at 10%. I would point out that well reported ROE in 2020, for global markets was 14.1%. The performance ex-litigation that's otherwise allocated to the segment was 18.1%. I think the other point I would make here is that, as we look forward, and as we've commented several times, impossible to know what 2021 and beyond hold in terms of what the industry is presented, but I think there have been some fairly profound structural shift in that business. One, of course, is the expense base is being reduced. The second is we're much more attuned to the sort of agile deployment of capital across. But I think perhaps most important, is the improvement of wallet share and the focus on clients. And David commented a couple of times on the improvement in overall wallet share growing by 120 basis points through three quarters, and we'll see what played out for the full year. But I'd also say that a step up in where we stand with the objective of being top three across the top 100 institutional clients and global markets, I think also reflects that we will capture at or better than our share on a going forward basis. Again, acknowledging that the market may not look as robust on the forward as it did in 2020 for this business, but the structural changes are important. Thanks Schorr. Yes, thanks so much. So let me take both of those first. On fundraising, I think what's gratifying about the progress made in 2020 was a comment David made about an increasing number of clients new to the firm that are investing with Goldman Sachs. And so, that leaves us optimistic about the prospect of the fundraising pipeline in 2020, which will be across a range of different investing sleeves and we'll start to see, that growing number of investing clients look across a range of different product offerings that we have. On the sell down, we're very attentive and have always been, to the prospect of creating kind of a canyon, and we don't anticipate that to happen and we'll continue to manage with that in mind. Now you draw the right observation, which is, there's $1.8 billion of embedded fees to take, which we will take when gains become irrevocable or irreversible and so that will buffer, but the point here is that, our objective is to reduce the stress loss intensity of that segment. And so we've spoken about $4 billion in balance sheet sales to yield $2 billion of capital relief. We equally have line of sight into another $2.5 billion of sales, which could generate another billion dollars of capital relief. And I'd also point out, though it's not obvious in the way in which the results play, but over the course of the year, we sold $2.1 billion of public equities to offset about $1.9 billion of appreciation in market value and so that equally has capital consequence for us. And so you'll continue to see us move along that road. Finally, on the question or the observation you made about what I was speaking to about what we will do in terms of attributed equity to that segment, that has no bearing on what our objective is, which is to bring capital down. But as CCAR 2020 was higher, more capital came to the firm, we don't keep a corporate segment. So we allocate or attribute that equity out to the segments, by definition, because of its intensity, asset management will pick up more capital. Obviously, on a unit of balance sheet reduction, more capital will come out as we reduce positions, which is why we're confident that we'll maintain at or better than what we're indicating in terms of capital reduction in the segment overall. The one of the thing I would add to the part of your question you asked about kind of high touch and low touch, which is, if you look at our credit business in FIC, over Q2, Q3 and Q4, what's interesting is in Q2 and Q3, you saw amidst very high volatility, a lot of the sort of bespoke idiosyncratic, block like activity that we've long been known for. What's interesting is, if you look at Q4, we started to see very high portfolio trading going on, rebalancing among asset managers, pension funds, a lot of that going on across our digital platforms. I'd just offer you that Q2, Q3 and then Q4, as a reflection of kind of a more, a broader, more robust business, that's better equipped, better capabled, better positioned to capture what we've long been known to do, as we did in the second and third quarter. And some of the more technology driven, platform driven, trading, that is newer, and quite sticky in the context of what we can keep. Yes, to the first part of your question, achieving $1.3 billion was annualized savings. So we would realize these savings each and every year. And this was as against kind of entry level expenses, meaning entering into 2020 when we announced them at Investor Day, but this is achieving a $1.3 billion annual run rate savings of which about half has been achieved. The only other thing I would add, on the forward is obviously COVID has accelerated our own thinking about moving populations and taking aggregations of people into different areas and so I think, you know, we feel more assured and confident at our ability to do that, the pace of it, and you'll continue to see that play forward in the achievement is the 1.3 or beyond. Yes, I mean, I think that, on the forward, you should expect a more moderated level of growth in deposits. As we pull more and more assets into the bank. I think, as I noted in the remarks, we've moved from 15% of assets in the banks to 25%, but importantly, on incremental asset movement, 90% of the lending that's going on, in and around the firm is being booked in bank entities that will consume deposit funding that goes on in the bank entities themselves. I'd also point out that when we speak about bank entities, we're not only speaking about our U.S. Bank, but equally the U.K. and our bank, in Continental Europe, in Germany, all of which have slightly different requirements in terms of the deployment of that funding, but the incremental asset flow is going into the bank, and you're going to start to see continued growth from 25% of the overall firm. Hi Betsy. Well, I think the, the abiding observation here is that there is considerable leverage in the business. That is when we'd grow revenue top line by 22% or grow at 17% net of provision for credit loss, you see our comp and benefit line rise by 8%. So there's embedded leverage in this business. I think, as we've also said in the past, and this is reflected a little bit in your question, the comp ratio is going to become much less of a relevant metric in this, in part, because the profile of the business will change. That is, as we grow up, businesses like transaction banking or the consumer business, they will be less comp heavy in terms of overall expense and that ratio will be ultimately less relevant. But I think, for where we are right now, there's considerable leverage in this where we're capable of rewarding our talent for performance overall, but equally doing that on a levered basis, so that our shareholders and shareholders benefit more broadly from the overall performance. Yes, I think the tech budget is going to continue to grow. It will grow by several $100 million dollars year-over-year. It will do that really for two reasons; one, continued improvement at the core, that is the way in which the firm operates more broadly. It is achievement of some of what David was talking about around automation and the like. And then separately, it will be focused on particular initiatives, like transaction banking, like the consumer business, and so forth. And I think part of, our focus on the efficiencies that we're capable, and the cost savings we're capable of getting is such that those savings can subsidize the investment being made in places like technology around the firm. And so you'll continue to see that investment play out. We have less remedial activity than perhaps some of the other bigger commercial banks have and as much as we have a lot of new tech build and new activity going on. But we're going to continue to look to harvest cost savings to substantially offset the impact of that increased investment. Yeah. So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on non-comp expense in the year. So, our non-comp was up 8% ex-litigation of about $900 million of non-comp expense increase year-over-year, about two thirds in excess of $600 million was variable expense, BC&E, all of which is related to the volume of activity that's coming through. And so, I just framed that just so you have a sense of how, non-comp framed out over the course of the year. Now, if you look at our achievement of about half of the 1.3 billion of run rate efficiencies that we've set as a target for ourselves, I would say up through the end of 2020, a good proportion of that came out of the compensation side, okay, relative to non-comp. So by that, I mean, we've undertaken a very significant exercise over the course of 2020 at spans and layers, meaning we've looked at the sheer number of people we have in a variety of, of parts of the organization. We've looked at scope of management, and we've been able to sort of achieve efficiencies in that regard. We engaged in a front to back exercise that put more people from an ops and technology point of view, in line of sight of the people in the business, who know and understand what their objectives are and where they're going. Third is we've looked at at location of where many of these people are and have accelerated that. And so that's on the sort of compensation side. On the non-compensation side, I would say that we've done a complete rationalization of campuses in places like London and in Bangalore, harvesting significant savings there, we've moved to a more disciplined and centralized planning tool. We've looked to centralize our expense management through SAP taking multiple platforms and bulling them into one, we've looked to centralize our expense management, through SAP, taking multiple platforms, and pulling them into one, all of these have sort of put us in a position to realize about 50% of the 1.3 billion, and frankly speaking, give us a bit more confidence about what we can achieve on the forward, perhaps in excess of it. And so that may be a bit more granular than you want, but just to lay out sort of the elements, right, of where these expenses are being harvested. Well, I think, the manner and form of our execution sort of will decide and you know, proceed forward. What I would reiterate is that, right now the Fed is not quite at the SCB regime that had been laid out initially. Remember, SCB was meant to put banks in a position. All banks, if you're above your minimum, you can go about share repurchase, dividend, et cetera. We're not there yet, the Fed has limited what we can do on repurchase. As I spoke about earlier, we will execute to the capacity that we have to repurchase in the first quarter. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the mechanism by which we will do it. But certainly, safe to rely on the fact that we'll look to use our capacity and proceed from there. Sure, so just to be clear in connection with the back book that we're acquiring relative to the GM partnership, we anticipate taking approximately $200 million of provisions in the first quarter. So to be clear, it's not reflected in 2020. I'm just giving you and the market sort of an indication of what that will be occasioned by the acquisition of that backlog. And that's an accounting, rule and requirements that we are adhering to. Sure. So again, in the fourth quarter, we're taking provision for credit loss of 293 million, I will tell you that embedded in that is a release of about $200 million, occasioned by better macroeconomic observations and adjusting the model and reserve release. That release though was offset in the context of incremental provisions either occasioned by impairments or growth in the overall portfolio. So it's not to reflect anything negative or a negative comment on the state of our performance of the portfolio, but rather growth in it across the whole of the firm. I would say as an aside, we continue to see our consumer portfolio performed better from a credit perspective than even what we had anticipated coming into the crisis. But embedded in the provision is release that release offset by growth and by impairments. So remember, on the efficiency ratio, and obviously, it's implied by your question, there's revenue and there's an expense component to it. On the revenue side, we saw more growth in 2020, than had been anticipated. But we nonetheless expect levels of growth consistent with what we anticipated at our Investor Day. And I'd also point out that we continue to work on the expense side, as we've spoken about in relation to a number of questions on this call, and there continues to be leverage in the business to the extent that revenue growth doesn't materialize. As we expected, we've got levers to pull on expense, which is why we are comfortable, with a view that will achieve an efficiency ratio at around 60% by 2022. Obviously, we were better than that X litigation in 2020. There will be variability to it. But, there are levers to pull as and to the extent that the growth doesn't play, but we're assuming that it will. And it it's not entirely reliant on global markets. Yes, I think that's fair. So I'm going to go back to a response I made to one of the questions earlier, which is, Q2 and Q3 look different than Q4, we experienced and benefited from wider bid offer during the intensity of what played out in Q2 and Q3 and the fact as David has mentioned now several times that we stayed the game and showed up across a range of asset classes helped us and we benefited from that. There's no question that has moved to the back of the year in Q4, you saw compression from what was wide in Q2 and Q3. But there again, wallet share gains benefited us, and equally, playing to both high touch and low touch. And so the advent of what we were doing through marquee, and equally through portfolio trading on these electronic platforms was of equal benefit. So tighter bid offer there as opposed to wider bid offer in Q2. But I think you're seeing a business that is more diverse, broader and in a position to continue to intermediate flows and do so with very high balance sheet velocity. Since there are no more questions, we'd like to take a moment to thank everybody for joining the call on behalf of the senior management team. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months and if there any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather and her team, otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter call in April. Thank you."

This call is being recorded today, October 14, 2020.  Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.\nHeather Kennedy Miner: Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.  Today I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start by reviewing third quarter and year-to-date performance. He will also provide an update on our client franchise, the macroeconomic backdrop, and our progress on returning to office. Stephen will then discuss our third quarter results in detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I\u2019ll now pass the call over to David. David?\nDavid Solomon: Thanks Heather, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I\u2019d like to start by saying that all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends and family remain healthy amid the continuing challenges with COVID-19. Let me begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results.  In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.8 billion, up 30% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $3.6 billion, record quarterly earnings of $9.68 per share, and a return on equity of 17.5% and return on tangible equity of 18.6%.  Our third quarter results contributed to strong year-to-date revenues of $33 billion and an ROE of 8%. Litigation costs burdened our year-to-date returns by over 500 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses in the first half.  The third quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We benefited from an improving market backdrop, high levels of client engagement, continued countercyclical performance in market making, and positive momentum across our strategic initiatives. We maintained our leading global position in M&A as announcements increased in the quarter from a relatively dormant period earlier in the year. We maintained strong lead [ph] table positions in underwriting, including a number one ranking in equity underwriting and a top three ranking in high yield, with both markets very active during the quarter. We again delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities on solid client activity across our global platform, reinforced by recent market share gains across asset classes in the first half of 2020. In asset management, we recognized strong gains from our public and private equity positions. We also generated strong investment performance and positive net interest income in our credit portfolio, and we continued to have success with our West Street Strategic Solutions Fund, where we\u2019re on track for $14 billion of total commitments. We are delivering our full spectrum of alternatives capabilities and have launched marketing on new funds in private equity, growth equity, and real estate. In wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra high net worth PWM clients. We also made progress integrating our new personal financial management business to provide our high net worth clients with a broader set of capabilities, and we\u2019ve been pleased to see synergies between both groups, which have resulted in 700 referrals this year, representing over $2.5 billion of an asset opportunity. In consumer, we continue to have success expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both directly and through partnerships. During the quarter, we launched Marcus Insights integrating Clarity Money\u2019s capabilities into the Marcus app to give consumers a more comprehensive view of their finances, and we continued to make progress building checking and investment capabilities, which will launch next year. On the partnership side, we launched seller financing with Wal-Mart and expanded on our June platform launch with Amazon. Additionally, our partnership with Apple continues to grow, and we look forward to leveraging our credit card platform for additional partnerships over time. Turning to the operating environment on Page 2, we continue to navigate an uncertain backdrop brought on by COVID-19, which has an unclear trajectory. From a macroeconomic perspective, the markets continue to benefit from the unprecedented monetary and fiscal support by central banks and governments globally. In the third quarter, the Federal Reserve announced its new approach to average inflation targeting and forecasted that short-term rates would remain locked near zero for the next several years. In that same vein, in the U.K. where the economy is expected to contract by over 9% this year, the Bank of England opened the door to negative rates as a potential policy tool.  Meanwhile, U.S. labor markets continue to show headline improvement with the unemployment rate declining to 7.9% in September, down nearly 50% from peak levels in April, reflecting approximately 13 million people out of work. That said, according to the latest job reports, those improvements were largely driven by reversals of temporary layoffs, while permanent job losses have risen to nearly 4 million people, reflecting some of the deeper challenges in our economy.  Additionally, there continues to be enormous uncertainty globally in the trajectory of the virus, which may impact the pace of the economic recovery as we head into the fall and winter. In particular, we see continued challenges in a number of impacted industries, including restaurants, hospitality, and oil and gas.  Despite these uncertainties, since our July earnings call our economists\u2019 expectations for 2020 U.S. GDP improved by 120 basis points to an expected contraction of 3.4%, while global growth estimates slipped 50 basis points to an expected 3.9% contraction. Looking into next year, estimates have strengthened with expected growth of nearly 6% in the U.S. and 7% globally.  In spite of the ongoing challenges, we are seeing higher global equity markets and tighter credit spreads, perhaps as a reflection of the speed of economic recovery. During the third quarter, the S&P 500 rallied by 8%, touching new highs in September and leaving the index up 4% for the year. This yearly gain, however, was concentrated in the top five tech companies, which rose 42%, while the remaining 495 names in the index declined by 2%.  Equity market volatility also remains elevated with the average VIX this quarter more than 60% higher than the third quarter a year ago, though well below levels seen in March and April. On the credit front, U.S. investment grade spreads tightened by roughly 20 basis points and high yield spreads tightened by almost 90 basis points during this quarter. As we go forward, we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weakness in the broader economy. Given the uncertain macro environment, we are focused on serving our clients to help them navigate this evolving backdrop. Before turning to Stephen, I\u2019d like to spend a moment on our approach to return to office. We have employed a number of new protocols to operate as safely as possible around the world. We do this as public and private healthcare organizations work tirelessly to develop therapies and vaccines, which I fully believe in time will allow all of us to return to a more normalized environment. We are focused on helping our people come back safely as being together enables greater collaboration, which is key to our culture. We continue to employ an adaptable approach which considers individual circumstances and local health recommendations to give our people the flexibility and the tools they need to return to the office safely.  We continue to make measured progress. In Hong Kong and Tokyo, we have around 60% of our people working from the office. In most of Europe, we\u2019re at around 50%, and in the U.K. we\u2019re at nearly 30%. In New York, we\u2019ve seen a gradual uptick since Labor Day with roughly 2,000 people working in office as of last week, and we currently have 30% of our people rotating through the New York office on a weekly basis. That said, we will continue to be nimble and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities in cities where we operate and are ready to shift gears if the evolving situation with COVID-19 warrants. Under all circumstances, we continue to keep the health and safety of our people as a top priority. In closing, I would like to thank the people of Goldman Sachs who have remained dedicated to serving our clients while managing the firm\u2019s risk, liquidity and capital to ensure our ongoing financial strength and operational resiliency. While 2020 has been a difficult year in many ways, I\u2019m incredibly pleased with the state of our client franchise and progress we\u2019ve made in executing on our strategic priorities, and I look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on our investor day goals at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the third quarter, the firm performed well across all four of our business segments. In investment banking, our corporate clients remained very active in raising debt and equity capital. We also saw an increase in strategic dialog following a more dormant period for M&A activity earlier in the year. In global markets, client engagement remained high as we gained share during the year and enabled clients to manage risks across asset classes. In asset management, strong growth was driven by higher management and other fees as well as gains from our long-term equity and credit investments following a more challenged first half of the year. We also saw double-digit revenue growth in our consumer and wealth management segment as we expand our service offering to individuals across the wealth spectrum. With those headlines, let me now turn to our specific business performance on Page 4, beginning with investment banking. Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of nearly $2 billion, up 7% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $507 million declined 27% versus last year on fewer transaction closings in the quarter, reflecting the lower level of client activity in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, year to date we participated in over $630 billion of announced transactions and closed approximately 225 deals for $810 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A lead tables by a meaningful margin. Importantly, the pace of M&A announcements has picked up considerably in recent months. Our announced deal volume in the third quarter was up more than fivefold versus the second quarter and our investment banking client dialogs remain active. The bigger headline in investment banking, again in the third quarter, was equity underwriting where we generated $856 million in revenues, more than double the levels seen a year ago, marking our second highest quarter ever. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting as our year-to-date volumes climbed to $80 billion across 436 deals, including 77 initial public offerings. In global IPOs, we ranked number one and picked up approximately 180 basis points of market share versus last year. We also saw strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in 21 private transactions, a high profile direct listing, and a number of SPAC IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in various forms.  In debt underwriting, net revenues were $571 million, up 9% from a year ago. Though volumes normalized from the record pace seen in the second quarter, the high yield market in particular saw healthy levels of new issue activity. Our activity also included a number of novel structure transactions, particularly among industries most impacted by COVID-19 such as airlines, where we uniquely enabled clients to leverage a broader collateral base to access capital. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to support our clients and grow our market share, generating a solid number four ranking in global debt underwriting year to date. This performance reflects our long-term strategic focus on this business as well as the velocity of underwriting commitments on our balance sheet. Looking forward, our investment banking backlog increased significantly versus the second quarter. Growth was supported by a ramp in M&A activity, as I noted earlier, as well as replenishment from equity and debt underwriting transactions. In particular, new M&A announcements are creating a pipeline for acquisition financing in the coming quarters. We are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FIG, consumer, healthcare, and industrials. Revenues from corporate lending were $35 million, reflecting lower results in relationship lending which includes the impact of tighter credit spreads on hedges. As I have noted before, for risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger lending commitments. Given the significant credit spread tightening over the last two quarters, we have now reversed the vast majority of the $375 million in hedge gains we saw in the first quarter. Also of note in relationship lending, we have seen material pay downs versus the first half. Total notional drawn on revolvers is now down 60% from the peak and nearing normalized levels. Moving to global markets on Page 5, where our businesses continued their strong performance, net revenues were $4.6 billion in the third quarter, up 29% versus a year ago amid attractive bid-offer spreads, a supportive market making backdrop, and continued elevated client activity.  We expanded our market share this year as our focus and commitment to serve clients during this volatile period drove results across asset classes and geographies. During the first half, McKinsey reported that Goldman Sachs Global Markets delivered the best institutional client performance among our global peers. Our strength was aided by number one rankings in both G10 rates and credit and the number one global ranking in equities, which included the number one position in EMEA and ties for number one in Asia and Japan. Turning to FIC on Page 6, third quarter net revenues were $2.5 billion, up 49% versus the third quarter of \u201919. Growth versus last year was driven by a 65% increase in intermediation, which more than offset a 9% decrease in financing revenues. In FIC intermediation, we had solid client flows and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year, leveraging our balance sheet to intermediate risk in a disciplined way.  In credit, performance was supported by strong client activity in the U.S. and tighter investment grade and high yield credit spreads. We also saw sustained volumes across our automated bond pricing engine.  In rates, revenues rose amid stronger risk management while client activity was solid, particularly around global central bank actions during the quarter. In commodities, strong performance was driven by our metals business and oil products amid persistent global supply imbalances. In mortgages, revenues rose amid higher levels of client activity in agency products, bolstered by solid risk management and tighter spreads.  In currencies, revenues were stable as we continued to serve our global client franchise with contributions across both G10 and emerging markets. Lastly in FIC financing, we saw lower revenues in repo and structured finance. Turning to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $2.1 billion, up 10% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36%, aided by higher client volumes across derivatives and cash, reflecting the scale and breadth of our client franchise. In derivatives, we saw solid activity in flow, structured, and corporate transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. In cash, we helped clients execute across both high and low touch channels. Equities financing revenues of $585 million declined 25% year over year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, average client balances rose to near record levels. Across global markets, we continued to invest in technology platforms to enhance client experience, build on our strength in risk management, and drive resource efficiencies. Like digital trends across many industries, COVID-19 has accelerated client adoption and on-boarding across our automated platforms. While it remains difficult to predict client activity and we do not have insight into the forward opportunity, we take confidence in the market share gains experienced by the business through a deepening set of client relationships, which has been a priority for the global markets leadership team. This progress should support revenue sustainability as we go forward. We also believe the upcoming U.S. election, the variability of economic growth outlook, and the 2021 global LIBOR transition may bolster client activity across markets. Additionally, to the extent that sustained low interest rates have their intended effect of stimulating economic growth and recovery, client activity may be further invigorated. Moving to asset management on Page 7, in the third quarter we generated segment revenues of $2.8 billion, up over 70% versus a year ago. Our third quarter revenues were driven by the continued market rebound, event-driven activity, and positive corporate performance of our portfolio companies. Management and other fees totaled $728 million, up 10% versus a year ago driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower fee rate due to mix shift given growth in liquidity and fixed income products.  Equity investments produced $1.4 billion of net gains, aided by appreciation in our public investments and valuation marks related to event-driven activity across our private equity portfolio. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated nearly $800 million in gains from investments, including BigCommerce, Avantor, Sprout, and HeadHunter. On our $16 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of more than $400 million from various positions, with the majority driven by events including corporate actions such as fundraisings, capital markets activities, and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $230 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities.  Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $589 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected mostly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments which continued to rebound from the broader market sell-off in the first quarter.  Let me now turn to Page 8, where we continue to provide transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet.  On the left side of this slide is our equity investment portfolio by sector, geography and vintage. Our private portfolio remains highly diversified with over 800 positions where excluding Global Atlantic, given its announced sale, none are larger than $425 million. We also provide insight into our $21 billion portfolio of CIEs primarily comprised of real estate investments, of which $12 billion are financed predominantly by non-recourse debt. The portfolio remains diversified by geography and real estate sector. On the right side of the slide, we show our $31 billion in lending and debt investments in the portfolio within the asset management segment, which includes $14 billion of debt investments and $17 billion of loans that are largely secured.  I\u2019ll now turn to consumer and wealth management on Page 9. In this segment, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the third quarter, up 13% versus a year ago, driven by higher wealth management AUS and higher consumer banking revenues. Wealth management and other fees of $957 million rose 9% versus last year, reflecting increased client transaction activity and higher assets under supervision, which rose 8% to $575 billion, including $24 billion of positive net inflows over the past 12 months.  Consumer banking revenues were a record $326 million in the third quarter, jumping 50% versus last year, reflecting net interest income from credit card lending, strong year over year deposit growth, and lower deposit rates. Consumer deposit totaled $96 billion, reflecting $4 billion of growth in the quarter. The slower pace was expected as we continued to limit U.K. new account growth in light of regulatory caps and reduced the rate on our U.S. market savings accounts given the lower interest rate environment. While we exhibited improving beta in our deposit book, we saw very limited outflows of deposits consistent with our expectations, despite two rate cuts during the quarter.  Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7 billion, of which approximately $4 billion were from Marcus loans and $3 billion from Apple Card. We continue to prudently risk manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates. While we remain attentive to the embedded risk, we continue to be pleased with the credit performance of these portfolios.  Next, let\u2019s turn to Page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS decreased slightly to $2 trillion during the quarter, but are up approximately $275 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by $90 billion of liquidity outflows following strong inflows in the first half, that offset by $51 billion of market appreciation and $18 billion of long term inflows.  On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.1 billion for the third quarter, up versus a year ago primarily reflecting growth in the firm\u2019s balance sheet particularly in global markets, as well as the benefit from deposit growth and re-pricing in consumer and wealth management. Importantly, as I have noted in the past, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. Our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets and predominantly hedged or floating rate liabilities. Nevertheless, even if interest rates remain low, we expect NII to gradually expand over time given our ability to prudently grow loans and further re-price consumer deposits. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $112 billion, down $5 billion sequentially driven by a $7 billion decrease in corporate loans from pay downs in relationship lending and a $1 billion reduction in Marcus installment loans, offset by modest growth in wealth management and credit card loans.  Our provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $278 million, meaningfully lower than the $1.59 billion taken last quarter and down 4% versus a year ago. This lower provision versus the second quarter reflects relative stability in our portfolio and improvements in the broader economic backdrop, which is the dominant driver of inputs to our modeling of pool reserves.  At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loan and commitments stood at $4.3 billion, including $3.7 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was stable versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $100 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 16.1%. The provision of $278 million includes wholesale impairments of approximately $230 million primarily relating to select credits in the TMT, industrials, and natural resources sectors. During the quarter, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $340 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 1.3%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter.  Next, let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 12.  Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6 billion increased 6% versus last year, with compensation expenses up 14% year-over-year amidst higher revenue growth net of provisions, and non-compensation expenses down 2%. Higher compensation expenses reflected year-over-year growth in revenue net of credit provisions. Our non-comp expenses were slightly lower versus last year as we continued to invest in new businesses, including transaction banking and credit card as well as the United Capital acquisition, now rebranded Personal Financial Management.  While we benefited from lower expenses of approximately $100 million from the temporary reduction in travel, entertainment and advertising expenses due to COVID-19, we also saw an approximately $90 million reduction in litigation and professional fees and a roughly $50 million reduction in double occupancy-related costs from our new facilities in London and Bangalore. These were offset by a roughly $60 million increase in activity related expense from brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees, as well as a roughly $85 million increase related to technology investments across the firm. Our reported year to date efficiency ratio was 69.6%, which was burdened by nearly 10 percentage points of litigation expense. We continue to make progress on our expense savings initiatives as set forth at investor day and will continue to assess our ability to go further than what we outlined in January. Finally, our reported tax rate was 28% for the year to date, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% over the next few years. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 14.5% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 120 basis points sequentially. The improvement was driven primarily by earnings as well as lower market RWAs, reflecting reduced market volatility, and lower credit RWAs. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 110 basis points to 13%, also on earnings and RWA reductions from lower market volatility.  We are confident in our capital position, now 90 basis points above our 13.6% stress capital buffer requirement. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at investor day is appropriate for our firm on a medium term basis as we execute our strategic initiatives, build more durable fee-based revenues, and reduce the stress loss intensity of our business. To that end, we will continue asset harvesting, including our announced sale of Global Atlantic.  While our capital ratio will likely remain elevated near term given continued regulatory restrictions on share repurchases, we would expect our management buffer to decline over time, particularly as markets express less volatility. Importantly, we stand ready to commit capital and balance sheet to support our clients, and we expect to resume share repurchases once permitted consistent with our longstanding capital management policy. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, roughly flat versus last quarter. We maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $302 billion, up modestly versus last quarter, reflecting the current backdrop. We expect our GCLA will evolve in the context of client demand for our balance sheet and overall market conditions.  On the liability side, our total deposits decreased to $261 billion, down $8 billion versus last quarter driven by planned roll-off of higher cost brokered deposits and more modest growth in retail deposits. Our long term debt declined by $9 billion during the quarter, driven by maturities. We expect issuance to remain relatively low for the remainder of the year, although we may consider pre-funding some planned first quarter 2021 issuances. In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, and flexibility in our highly liquid balance sheet. Despite the continued overhang from COVID-19 and challenges from the work-from-home environment, we continue to leverage our technology platforms and intellectual capital to support our clients.  During this difficult time, we remain dedicated to executing our strategy in our core business and driving forward the new initiatives and operating efficiency programs we laid out in January. Importantly, we have been proud to see our dedicated client engagement efforts continue to pay off, resulting in gains in mind share and market share as we help clients navigate this volatile environment. On the forward, our risk managers will remain in a conservative posture given the uncertain trajectory of the virus and early stages of the recovery to ensure we are well positioned to proactively support our clients.  While our path to our medium term targets will inevitably not be a straight line, we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues, and higher returns for shareholders over time. With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Obviously, great trading results. I\u2019m curious if you could characterize any--how you think about any incremental risk you take to execute all that, and if there\u2019s any impact on future stress tests. I\u2019m just looking to balance client franchise with any risks associated with it. Thanks. \nStephen Scherr: Sure Glenn, thanks. I would say the performance of the trading businesses in the third quarter, frankly like it was in throughout most of the first part of the year was really done with an eye toward high velocity turn on balance sheet; that is, we were very well prepared to commit capital to facilitate intermediation but saw our mission equally as moving and trading on that risk very efficiently, and so we could see the kind of turnover that we needed. We didn\u2019t see dramatic pick-up in risk occasioned by that pattern and that strategy, and I think that leaves us in a good position with respect to what we will submit as part of the second version of CCAR, and I don\u2019t see our risk as being unusually elevated in the context of producing these kinds of results. \nGlenn Schorr: That\u2019s great. Then I missed it - I don\u2019t know if you gave us the realized versus unrealized split. I think I wrote down everything you said on the equity -- I\u2019m talking the equity investment line, I couldn\u2019t tell how much of it was actually realized. The lead or the follow-on to that is, have you considered monetizing more with markets at all-time highs? You have a pretty seasoned portfolio with two-thirds in the four to eight years old-plus range, so I\u2019m looking to see how you balance the capital intensity of those investments with the earnings power and what your capital deployment options are right now. Thanks.\nStephen Scherr: Sure, no problem. Let me just go through the breakdown in equities. Of the $1.4 billion in revenue, our public portfolio generated $781 million in revenue, and the private part of the equity portfolio generated $642 million. Now importantly, when you look at the private portfolio, $284 million of that $642 million was generated on events, so that\u2019s sales, monetizations, IPOs, and the like, and $52 million - only $52 million - was non-event driven, that is looking at the baseline performance of the underlying company and making a judgement about where value is appropriately pegged, and so event being the dominant component of the private portfolio. The balance, I should point out, of $306 million relates to CIEs. As it relates to the public portfolio, we observe the market no differently than you do. Obviously, there\u2019s a certain component of that public portfolio that remains restricted. A decent amount of it remains unrestricted, and we will look for opportunities as we have been to monetize those stakes. By the way, I say that not just simply in the context of an attractive market valuation in which to sell but equally in the context of the kind of broader strategic mission we\u2019ve been on, which is to lower the balance sheet intensity and capital intensity of that as we shift to more third party investing itself, and so that you a bit of the lay of the land as to the two components to your question.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nStephen Scherr: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning David and Stephen. Maybe sticking with the trading question, Stephen, you gave some pretty interesting color on why you think trading revenues should be sustainable into 2021. Can you expand on those a bit? I\u2019m particularly interested in your point around LIBOR transition? Just give us more detail there and sort of why you think Goldman is well placed to capitalize. \nStephen Scherr: Sure, so why don\u2019t I start with trading. I think at the core, our view on sustainability is not with a crystal ball and a forward forecast as to what the opportunity set will be. It is more rooted in the fact that over the course of the year and looking at data through the first half, we have picked up meaningful market share in and among various client sets across all of the businesses in our trading business. This was a very concerted effort on the part of the leadership of that business to go at finding ourselves moving up the ladder in the top 1,000 clients that matter to the trading division. The sustainability of our performance for me is rooted more in the fact that we\u2019ve picked up share gains. We were there for clients particularly during the most volatile moments of the second quarter across all asset classes without withdrawing, and I think it sets us up to capture whatever the opportunity set is on the forward.  My comments in the prepared remarks is that as I look forward to the fourth quarter, we can count on any number of issues to be the source of some volatility, whether that\u2019s U.S. election, LIBOR transition, the trajectory of COVID - any one of those, and part of the reason that we are at capital levels we are, part of the reason we have maintained higher liquidity than we ordinarily would, is such that we can serve clients should that volatility occur without putting ourselves offside on any one of those metrics. I think that\u2019s part of the color I\u2019d give you both in terms of what\u2019s sustainable, and equally why we feel confident that we\u2019ve put our financial resources in a proper frame to play on the volatility itself. Just lastly on your question about LIBOR transition, we\u2019ve had a dedicated team - I mean, people who are 100% dedicated to this effort from the beginning. We\u2019ve put ourselves in a position where we\u2019ve done issuance, we have prepared ourselves in terms of counterparty contracts and the like, and I think we\u2019re very well prepared. Obviously, we don\u2019t skew in ways in which commercial banks do with LIBOR based elements in mortgages and the like, but in the scope of what is our business, we feel quite well prepared for that onset.\nChristian Bolu: Great, thank you. Maybe switching to acquisitions, again maybe David this one is for you, given the frenzy at Morgan Stanley on deals, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about M&A, maybe what businesses or initiatives would benefit from an acquisition, and then if you can just touch on how you think your relative currency and capital position places you to do a transformative deal.\nDavid Solomon: Christian, I appreciate the question, and of course we laid out a medium-term plan with a set of goals, and you and others continue to ask us about this. We\u2019re on a journey to continue to strengthen our returns and broaden our business to create a more diverse business with more sustainable revenues over time. We now have the business, we think, fully set up and organized after we re-segmented last year and made some changes internally so that the platforms that we think we can really operate from are well positioned to grow, and this includes our two more traditional platforms that everybody is always focused on, investment banking and global markets, which really for lack of a better term is a corporate investment bank. We have a big asset management platform which is global, broad, deep, multi-product all over the world, and we think there are opportunities to continue to grow that organically for sure, but certainly we\u2019d consider inorganic opportunities to grow that if we thought that they were enhancing.  And then, we obviously are building a broader consumer wealth platform to serve individuals and we certainly think there can be opportunities to accelerate the growth of that. In fact, last year we made an acquisition in United Capital that we think accelerated our expansion into high net worth wealth in a meaningful way, and we\u2019ve now been integrating that quite successfully. So we continue to look broadly at things that can extend our strategy and accelerate the pace. It\u2019s clear if you look at the actions of others that the market has been tolerant of tangible book value dilution in the context of something they think is on strategy and advances the trajectory of the business, so we\u2019ll continue to look and see if there are opportunities; but other than that, it would be hard for me to say anything more at this point.\nChristian Bolu: That\u2019s helpful, thank you, David.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First one, just on your efficiency ratio, you guys beat the 60% this quarter and year to date, ex the legal, you\u2019re at the 60%. I guess the big takeaway is the operating leverage clearly works in the model, but can you provide some color of maybe where you\u2019re at in the investment and efficiency three-year timeline? Most of it is just to help with the expense trend line - you know, the efficiency ratio outlook, depending on how the revenue backdrop plays out.\nDavid Solomon: I\u2019ll start and Stephen might give some more granular detail, but I\u2019d say that at a high level, Michael, and appreciate the question, there\u2019s no question that our efficiency has benefited from an environment which has allowed us an opportunity in some of our businesses to capture more revenues, and some of that, as Stephen highlighted, is really due to market share gains and we think that will be more sticky. Some of it is due to the environment. There is no question as we looked at our three-year trajectory and thinking about our desire to run the firm more efficiently that this environment and the crisis slowed down some of the actions we might have taken during this year. We\u2019ve now begun to deal with some things from an efficiency perspective that we might have dealt with earlier in the year, and we then have two more years to go through and execute that plan.  We continue to be very committed to that plan. We continue to be very comfortable with that plan. We actually think there might be things that we\u2019ve seen or we\u2019re learned that may create more opportunities for us to advance from that plan, but at this point our intention is to give you a more detailed granular update when we review our plan in January at the next earnings call. Stephen, is there anything you\u2019d want to add to that?\nStephen Scherr: You know, Mike, the only thing I would add to David\u2019s comment is that I think that on the forward, we\u2019re going to continue to look at strategic value locations as areas where we can grow and develop a number of different businesses, particularly the newer ones. I would say automation continues to be a priority for us across the whole of the firm - you know, automating what goes on in risk and the various control functions, and equally automating platforms that have captured the attention of client sets. I\u2019d also say that--look, it\u2019s hard to look at one quarter as a spot for efficiency. Obviously it\u2019s important to look out the whole year, but equally this is a medium term journey that we\u2019re on, and I think some of those will--some of the items that I mentioned, that David mentioned will bear fruit in terms of creating greater operating leverage.  The last thing I\u2019d say is that we have said on prior earnings calls that it\u2019s important to look at operating expenses in totality because as we continue to build businesses like transaction banking, like the consumer business, they will be less human intensive, they will be more automate, and therefore we move away from the compensation intensity associated with those businesses as a general matter. I think there are a number of levers to pull over the medium term.\nMike Carrier: All right, that\u2019s helpful. Just a follow-up on Glenn\u2019s asset management question, one of the things we\u2019ve seen in some of the private companies is they\u2019ve been slower to rebound, given the economic backdrop, so any insight you can provide on the private portfolio companies, either those facing more COVID-related pressure or those that aren\u2019t, and if that will have an impact beyond the pace of monetization.\nStephen Scherr: Sure, so as we looked across the portfolio and we did it in the first quarter, did it in the second and again did it in the third, we look at those that are most acutely impacted by COVID. Their circumstance in some sense hasn\u2019t changed, and they remain untouched from the downward mark pressure and valuation that we saw in the first and second quarter. There are others that have turned the corner as being affected by COVID, and that is as much a function of where the market is moving, where consumers are moving and the like. Then there are others that historically have been untouched by this, and so I would say we continue to look at it through the frame of COVID impact and equally we look obviously at the underlying performance of the business, and not exclusively as against public market comparables and the like. By the way, this is of course for that part of the private portfolio not otherwise marked, given other events that are going on, so that frame remains the same in terms of how we look at that portfolio itself. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nManan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. This is Manan Gosalia on for Betsy Graseck. I wanted to ask on your capital levels, I know you said you expect to manage to about a 13% to 13.5% CET1 ratio over time, but can you speak to where you expect to maintain capital in the near term, at least until the 2021 stress test? Do you expect to maintain the same buffer over your required minimum as you did this quarter, or--you know, I know you mentioned that you could see strong activity in the markets in 4Q with the election and the market rebound. Is there more room to be a little bit more nimble and maybe increase exposure and market RWAs in the fourth quarter? \nStephen Scherr: Sure. I think we\u2019ve brought our CET1 ratio to 14.5% really to sort of fix ourselves in a competitive position in anticipation, as I said, of the potential for volatility and higher trading over the course of the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say again that we run roughly with a 50 to 100 basis point buffer. Where within that range we stand, obviously at the higher end now, is equally a function of volatility from a risk management point of view - that is, we\u2019re in a market that is more likely to express higher, not lower. As and to the extent that that volatility subsides, we will see the buffer come down and will adjust, again consistent with where we are. On the longer term trend, over the medium to longer term, the reinforcement of 13% to 13.5% is more a reflection, I think as I\u2019ve said in the comments, of a forward direction to create, and as David noted, lower stress loss impact in the overall composition of the business, meaning as we continue to pursue certain of our strategic initiatives which create more durable fee-based revenue, lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet intensity, we\u2019ll be in a position where I think the requirement of us will come down and therefore over the medium term, we\u2019ll move more in that direction. \nManan Gosalia: Great, thank you. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on the M&A advisory front? We\u2019re seeing the announcement come through, both your own and the industry, M&A announcements have been pretty strong in the third quarter. Can you give us some more color on what you\u2019re hearing from corporates and sponsors, and how long do you think this increase in announcements can persist into next year?\nDavid Solomon: There\u2019s no question that earlier in the year, given the dramatic nature of the start of the pandemic and the uncertainty that persisted, M&A activity came to a screeching halt, and really through the second quarter, new announcements and activity levels were quite low. Stephen made comments with respect to the pick-up in our backlog. We\u2019ve seen an increase in activity. I think we see an increase in activity and announcements but also an increased dialog, and I would say that CEO confidence has improved meaningfully in the quarter. It\u2019s still not at the high elevated levels that might have been at the beginning of the year, but CEO confidence and the dialog we\u2019re having is certainly improved.  Against that backdrop, I would expect to see numerous companies trying to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen position. I think one of the things that\u2019s going on in the crisis is people are seeing that there continues to be efficiency in scale. As the world continues to digitize, it requires greater investment, and that obviously advantages companies with scale.  Our base case, based on what we\u2019re seeing, is that his increase in activity will continue through the rest of the year into 2021, but I would say that you\u2019ve got to be flexible and understand that if for some reason, the course of the pandemic or the economic trajectory changes some of that confidence that\u2019s currently building, that could slow down, but at the moment activity levels appear quite good. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawkin with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawkin: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. David, you referenced that you\u2019ll be providing an update to the strategic goals and targets that you laid out on the fourth quarter call, and you said you are committed--you remain committed to those goals, so that\u2019s encouraging, certainly in light of some of the stories we\u2019ve seen in the press which were a little confusing. But I wanted to, number one, confirm that the--a refute of the press reports that you are considering backing away from those targets and also hear how loan and deposit growth experience through 2020 has compare to your pre-pandemic expectations, and how long should we think about a headwind from the liquidity, the excess liquidity that you guys are holding as a hindrance to NII. How temporary is that likely to be? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Okay, so a couple things. First, and I just want to be very clear about it, it\u2019s one article. I saw the article. The article was wrong, it was incorrect. We\u2019ve never considered changing our targets. There\u2019s been no discussion about it, so we\u2019re committed to our targets and we\u2019re making progress on our targets. I don\u2019t have anything really else to say about the article, other than it was incorrect.  With respect to the second part of your question, and I\u2019m sorry - I\u2019m now on the third part of your question, where you\u2019re asking about deposits. There was something in the middle, right?\nStephen Scherr: Loans.\nDavid Solomon: Oh, about--\nBrennan Hawkin: Lending.\nStephen Scherr: Lending versus our expectations before the pandemic.\nDavid Solomon: Sure, so when you look at deposits--that\u2019s right, deposit growth and loan growth. When you look at deposit growth, what I\u2019d say, and we talked about this in last quarter\u2019s call, deposit growth and the acceleration of our ability to attract digital deposits definitely accelerated during this year because of the pandemic, faster than we had expected. We\u2019ve obviously been managing that flow, and you saw in this quarter based on actions we took that we slowed down the growth in that deposit rate because we had well exceeded what we expected to do for the year.  At the same point in time, when you look at the consumer business which still remains very, very small, as we entered the pandemic we had the ability to be more controlled on the growth of that portfolio. We remain committed to the targets we set out in our investor day in January, but it didn\u2019t seem as we entering the pandemic and there was such uncertainty during the bulk of this year, that we should be leaning in toward driving those targets. My expectation would be if the economic environment continues to improve, you\u2019ll see an improvement in that loan growth as we head into 2021, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor that appropriately and cautiously. \nBrennan Hawkin: That\u2019s clear, thanks. Then when we think about the expense side, comp clearly had a big benefit here this quarter. Is the best way to look at that year to date? I know the fourth quarter is an important one for when you guys true up the pool and consider competitive dynamics and the like, but any additional color you can provide there? When we think about comp ratio, should we think about it net of provision or gross? You referred--I think, Stephen, you referred to it net of provision in your prepared remarks, but in prior times it was referred to as gross, so just wanted to try to square that a bit. Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Brennan, at a high level, and Stephen made comments on this too, but at a high level as we develop different businesses, and Stephen pointed to this, we\u2019re developing businesses that have a different component of people cost than some of our businesses had had historically. When we set a comp ratio, we are always thinking based on the information we have at the time what do we think is necessary to pay our people competitively and protect our franchise. PCLs are a cost of doing business. It\u2019s a reflection of the capital that\u2019s embedded in the businesses, and it obviously affects that judgement. In a year where there were very, very low PCLs, the difference between those two ratios is very little. In a year where there are very significant PCLs, given the nature of the time we\u2019re on in the cycle, obviously there\u2019s a big difference and that will weigh more heavily in those years. But we continue to see real operating leverage in our business as we execute on our strategy, as things continue to digitize and we continue to automate, but in addition we have excellent people in a number of businesses that need to be paid when people perform, and we\u2019ll stay very, very focused on making sure that we\u2019re competitively and well positioned, but you\u2019re seeing some of the operating leverage come through on the business. \nStephen Scherr: Brennan, I would just point out that through three quarters, when you look at comp as a percentage of revenue net of provisions, we are spot on to where we were last year, and so there\u2019s obviously no change in philosophy. I think David gave you all the reasons why it\u2019s important that we take stock of provisions in the context of looking at that. I would say, though, more generally it\u2019s important to focus on the efficiency ratio of the firm over an extended period of time, because as I said earlier, comp will be inevitably but one component of a set of operating expenses by which the firm is carrying itself, so I think efficiency ratio will be a better indicator of the firm\u2019s ability to manage.  But that\u2019s not to ignore the focus and the view into comp as an expense, and so I think part of what David and I have told you gives you a sense of how we\u2019re looking at it relative to provisions and where it sits on a year-to-date basis. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  First question, just want to touch on the stock for a moment. Looking at the stock, the price is down $20 year to date, book value is up about $10, you\u2019ve put one MDB behind you, you had a record EPS quarter today. Just want to think a little bit about you guys talk about the stock price internally. You essentially have laid out a transparent plan for the business, you\u2019ve set long term initiatives that imply a business shift towards higher multiple areas, so I\u2019m just curious if the mentality is that as you execute on the plan over time, the price will just take care of itself, or are we maybe getting to a point where it makes sense to take more of a stand around stock, just given that it has implications for how you run the business.\nDavid Solomon: Well you know, Devin, I think you\u2019ve laid this out very well. We\u2019ve put out a plan, we believe we\u2019re executing. We\u2019ve got a lot more work to do. If we execute, I assume the stock will follow, and we\u2019re focused on shareholder value. We\u2019re focused on the medium to longer term, and I feel good--we feel good as a leadership team as to how we\u2019re progressing. But there\u2019s more work to do and our assumption is if we continue to deliver consistently over the medium and longer term, shareholders will benefit and the stock price will perform. \nDevin Ryan: Okay, thanks David. Just a follow-up here on the consumer business. There was several changes to leadership in consumer and wealth during the quarter. I\u2019m just curious if that implies any focus in shift in the business, or just any color around implications there to strategy or how the business is run.\nDavid Solomon: There\u2019s no focus in strategy or how the business should be run. One of the things that I believe very strongly and that we\u2019ve been driving toward as a management team since we took over as a management team two years ago was getting the way we talk about the business to be set up in a way where we could transparently talk about our different big business platforms, and to have those businesses aligned with the way we were running the business internally. That is not something that traditionally we had. We had external segments, we had different divisions internally.  We made segment shifts at the end of last year to set up the platforms the way we expected to run them, and the announcements we made now get people who are driving the strategy and moving those platforms forward aligned with the way we talk about the businesses to you, to the investing community, to our shareholders, and we feel that\u2019s an important step forward. So there\u2019s no change, but rather just a continuation of the journey we\u2019ve been on to get the firm aligned up and set up now with these four big platforms that we really think we can drive growth over time.\nStephen Scherr: Devin, the only thing I would add, just to touch on the specifics of performance within the consumer business, so overall the Marcus unsecured loans closed the quarter at a lower balance than where it began the year, and Apple Card balances were higher than where we ended the year. Both of those were very purposeful in the context of managing through a young portfolio in an uncertain moment with respect to the consumer. I would also say that the loss behavior, if you will, or the credit behavior of that portfolio is outperforming our modeled expectations; that is, losses have been coming down relative to that which was otherwise budgeted or forecasted, which is as much a function of how we\u2019ve managed underwriting on the entry, how we\u2019ve managed customers under customer assistance plans and the like, so that just gives you a sense of where performance lies in the context of David\u2019s comments.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I think my question is rooted in my business school class, when I read In Search of Excellence, and it said stick to your knitting. I\u2019m not sure if you recall that old book, and maybe it\u2019s just too ancient, but when I look at your business, the capital market side - I mean, you\u2019re clearly gaining wallet share. It reminds of 2009 when you were successful in supporting your customers through the last recession. On the other hand, the expansion businesses - you know, buying into credit cards, one concern I hear is you\u2019re just buying into a lower PE activity. You certainly seem committed on that strategy, but it seems like there\u2019s still questions there.  Specific questions on the side where there\u2019s a lot more confidence, the legacy businesses of capital markets, your M&A backlog, how does that compare to the all-time high, and trading, by how much has the wallet share gain been to the environment because VIX is so high, versus new business, so that\u2019s on the positive side? And on the less confident side, the growth, what do you bring when you buy a credit card that the seller wasn\u2019t providing before? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: There was a lot there, Mike, and so if I--I appreciate all the questions, if I don\u2019t get them all. I just want to highlight, I don\u2019t remember the book because I didn\u2019t go to business school.  But as I try to pick through and answer, first on M&A backlog, I think Stephen said this, while M&A backlog strengthened during the quarter, it\u2019s not back to where it was at the beginning of the year, and it\u2019s certainly not at its all-time high.  With respect to market share gains, in global markets I think the market share gains, we believe as a management team that the market share gains are rooted in an evolution back of our strategy to really being very, very client centric, our One GS approach, and really trying to think about how we as an organization deliver for our clients in a very central way. This is core to the way we\u2019re running the whole firm. It\u2019s been a big initiative over the last two years, and we think it\u2019s having a real impact on the way our clients interact with us and our ability to serve our clients, and we think that\u2019s helping our market share. Certainly the volume levels, I think at this moment in time, are elevated, the overall activity levels are elevated to some degree based on the pandemic and the volatility in markets. But I think the market share is coming from the way we\u2019re executing a strategy, and we began that focus well before COVID. We began that focus two years ago, and I think we\u2019re really getting results from that investment. The third thing with respect to the credit card business, it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019re in any business that has a lower PE than the current PE that we trade at, but when you look at our vision for what we\u2019re trying to do in building a digital consumer platform that marries our strong expertise in wealth while also providing a digital experience for general banking services for consumers, we\u2019re committed to it, we believe in it, but we want to be perfectly clear - this is something that\u2019s going to be built over a long period of time, just like we announced today with an extraordinary franchise where we have over $2 trillion of assets under supervision. That\u2019s been built over a very long period of time, and we believe it\u2019s really accreted to the value of Goldman Sachs and our shareholders over a very long period of time. We\u2019re going to continue to work at this cautiously. I know there\u2019s skepticism out there. We\u2019re going to prove over time as to why we think it\u2019s right, and we\u2019ll continue to advance it.\nMike Mayo: I\u2019m going to ask you a question that\u2019s not really your responsibility, but it goes back to an earlier question. On a day like today and last quarter, the market seems to be giving you a PE of one or even less one-year earnings. I think there\u2019s a disconnect between the lumpiness of your capital markets revenues with the annuity-like nature of your customer relationships, so I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any way that you could put in context the recurring nature of the bulk of the capital markets activity, even while parts are lumpy. I think some shareholders are very frustrated, as was reflected by the earlier question.  I know your view is, look, stock prices follow earnings. You\u2019ve had a focus on growing book value. Let\u2019s grow book value and everything else will take care of itself. Is that still the way you think about that?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think your last statement is true, but I\u2019ll make a couple of other comments at a high level and it would offer a perspective. I know, Mike, you\u2019d have a perspective on this too. For sure we\u2019re going to continue to focus on performing, and I think over time it will take care of itself. At a high level, the banking sector and financials broadly are well out of favor, so it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re sitting in a unique position. If you look at the people that you would benchmark us against and you look at how they trade on a relative basis, people are pretty clustered in the neighborhood. Is that something that I think is permanent? No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s permanent. Can you and I both speculate as to reasons why people feel that way at this point in the cycle, and with some of the uncertainty? Absolutely. I do think, to your point, the client franchise and the capital markets revenues that we have are, if you\u2019re looking at it not quarter to quarter but over periods of time as a franchise business, there is volatility in it compared to some businesses, but over any meaningful period of time, they generate lots of revenues, lots of earnings very consistently, so part of it depends on the frame through which you look. We can certainly go back over long periods of time and see how the client franchise and the strength of the client franchise continues to do well. We really believe when we focus on clients, that revenue will be sustained in the context of the market opportunity. As a business, we operate in a business that might have more short term volatility than some other businesses that are out there, that people benchmark in some way. I think it\u2019s an interesting time because of the pandemic and the uncertainty, so I think that hurts the overall neighborhood; but I continue to believe that we have big platforms, we have scale, we have leadership positions, those things are sticky. The things that we do are not going to go away, and if we focus on our clients and delivering for shareholders over time, I believe the stock price will follow.\nStephen Scherr: You know, Mike, an interesting development, just to amplify on David\u2019s comment, which is that even in the trading businesses, which one could argue are volatile in the context of the market, on certain of the electronic platforms that we\u2019re seeing, and I would speak specifically about the credit platform, we are seeing an increasing number of our clients come to those platforms, transact on those platforms. Now, that may be a function of work-from-home and the disposition of those clients, but we\u2019re seeing a growing presence. Their attachment to those platforms, whether it\u2019s marquee or otherwise, is sticky and tends to stay there, perhaps even more than what you might see in a high touch versus low touch. Getting into that in a business that you would not otherwise expect to be as predictable, if you will, I think is just something to take note in the context of your question.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Great, thanks. A quick question on the CET1 ratio. I noticed there was a meaningful reduction in the RWAs quarter on quarter, and I heard you talk about some of the environment, just being probably seasonality, impacting that. But can you kind of tease out the change in the RWA between what was more seasonality activity versus where you actively managed those RWAs lower to ensure you got over your SCB minimums?\nStephen Scherr: Yes, so I think on one hand, if you look on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s a question of volatility, so we\u2019d see it higher than not by virtue of volatility; otherwise, on a quarter on quarter basis, you see the positional set change, reduce exposure, certain diversification effect which plays to the positive, so there was no meaningful uptick in risk in the context of where RWA deployment otherwise was.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Okay, and then when you think about the CET1 ratio target that you\u2019re running to, obviously that assumes the SCB would improve for you from here. What are some of the actions that you\u2019re taking to get the SCB lower so that you can run at a 13% to 13.5% with the management buffer over the near term?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. Well, I think over the medium term, I think if you look at the various initiatives that we articulated at investor day and are executing on now, whether it is transaction banking, the consumer business, what we\u2019re doing with respect to our alts business, all of those will reduce the stress loss intensity of our business overall. Transaction banking will be a fee generating proposition. The alternatives business equally will give us a more durable thread of fees, and at the same time take down the capital and balance sheet intensity that otherwise weighs on the capital calculation. I think all of those are geared with an eye toward reducing down, as I said, stress loss intensity and ultimately leading to a lower SCB itself.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary around M&A and maybe the spillover impact on acquisition advance, but if think about what\u2019s been going on this year in terms of significant capital raising, both equity, DCM, how do we think about that going forward? It sounds like you\u2019ve replenished some of the coffer in terms of the pipeline. How much demand is there to shore up balance sheets and for capital markets activity, or is it a yin and yang where M&A picks up and capital raising comes down, and we don\u2019t really grow banking much? Just trying to think through that level of activity.\nDavid Solomon: Jim, I think it\u2019s a hard thing. I think it\u2019s a hard thing to look at and predict with granularity. There\u2019s no question that the environment pulled forward--both pulled forward some financing for companies and also created a whole bunch of financings that, if we didn\u2019t have this environment, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. There\u2019s no question that financing levels have been elevated during this year. At the same point in time, if again--and this goes back to my point as people think about this, if we get out of the mode of kind of thinking quarter to quarter to quarter, and we look at these as huge franchises where we have leading share and we\u2019re well positioned, I believe over any period of time - three years, five years, seven years, 10 year - there\u2019s going to be enormous corporate financing activity and we will have leading share in participating in that, and that will be a big profitable business that will enhance our franchise and help drive earnings growth and book value growth. So in the short term, it\u2019s hard for me to speculate. I mean, I would speculate that if things normalize, which I expect them to, we will not see the same velocity of financing in 2021 that we saw in 2020 as people tried to adapt and finance themselves out to create more runway, given the uncertainty in the environment. Again, big franchise, big opportunity, and whatever the market puts forward, I think we\u2019re well positioned to serve our clients and capture it.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe as a follow-up on that, maybe you could update us on your efforts to expand market share. You\u2019ve talked about going down market into the middle market. How has the progress been on that?\nDavid Solomon: I appreciate that question, Jim. The progress is going quite well, and I think one of the things that I know is self evident to everybody on the call, as market cap grows, there are more and more companies that grow into being worth $500 million, a billion, $2 billion that have never been on our radar screen, so that footprint has expanded meaningfully and there\u2019s been hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue accretion based on the opportunity set that\u2019s come from that, and I think that will continue.  I feel good about the way that platform expansion is going, and I think there continues to be more opportunity for us over time to continue to add to that footprint.\nOperator: You have a follow-up question from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. What is your appetite for asset management acquisitions, and along with that, I know you\u2019ve mentioned ROE and ROTCE, you\u2019ve always been very cognizant of having a lot of goodwill, and you don\u2019t have so much. So what\u2019s your appetite for asset management deals and what\u2019s your appetite for goodwill, and do you still have the same focus on ROE as much as ever?\nDavid Solomon: I think, Mike, that I\u2019m not going to say anything in response to this that\u2019s different to what I said just a few minutes ago. We are making investments to grow our business, our asset management business organically. Certainly the strategy we\u2019ve laid out in alternatives and the mix shift and the way we\u2019re approaching that is an organic effort. We certainly are aware of the continued consolidation that\u2019s going on in the asset management industry. We feel very well positioned as a very, very large global, broad and deep active asset manager. As opportunities come up, we\u2019ll consider them if we think they can enhance our franchise and allow us to expand the strength of our franchise and our ability to serve our institutional clients, and also individual clients through our wealth business. To the degree that we thought something would really enhance our ability to drive that platform, we would take on the goodwill that was necessary to do it. We\u2019re not afraid of that. We haven\u2019t seen the right opportunity for us at the moment, and so we\u2019ll continue to grow the business organically. If the right thing came along inorganically, we\u2019d take a very hard look at it.\nStephen Scherr: Okay, since there are no more questions in the queue, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather; otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks Heather, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I'd like to start by saying that all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends and family remain healthy amid the continuing challenges with COVID-19. Let me begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results.  In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.8 billion, up 30% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $3.6 billion, record quarterly earnings of $9.68 per share, and a return on equity of 17.5% and return on tangible equity of 18.6%.  Our third quarter results contributed to strong year-to-date revenues of $33 billion and an ROE of 8%. Litigation costs burdened our year-to-date returns by over 500 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses in the first half.  The third quarter continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We benefited from an improving market backdrop, high levels of client engagement, continued countercyclical performance in market making, and positive momentum across our strategic initiatives. We maintained our leading global position in M&A as announcements increased in the quarter from a relatively dormant period earlier in the year. We maintained strong lead [ph] table positions in underwriting, including a number one ranking in equity underwriting and a top three ranking in high yield, with both markets very active during the quarter. We again delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities on solid client activity across our global platform, reinforced by recent market share gains across asset classes in the first half of 2020. In asset management, we recognized strong gains from our public and private equity positions. We also generated strong investment performance and positive net interest income in our credit portfolio, and we continued to have success with our West Street Strategic Solutions Fund, where we're on track for $14 billion of total commitments. We are delivering our full spectrum of alternatives capabilities and have launched marketing on new funds in private equity, growth equity, and real estate. In wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra high net worth PWM clients. We also made progress integrating our new personal financial management business to provide our high net worth clients with a broader set of capabilities, and we've been pleased to see synergies between both groups, which have resulted in 700 referrals this year, representing over $2.5 billion of an asset opportunity. In consumer, we continue to have success expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both directly and through partnerships. During the quarter, we launched Marcus Insights integrating Clarity Money's capabilities into the Marcus app to give consumers a more comprehensive view of their finances, and we continued to make progress building checking and investment capabilities, which will launch next year. On the partnership side, we launched seller financing with Wal-Mart and expanded on our June platform launch with Amazon. Additionally, our partnership with Apple continues to grow, and we look forward to leveraging our credit card platform for additional partnerships over time. Turning to the operating environment on Page 2, we continue to navigate an uncertain backdrop brought on by COVID-19, which has an unclear trajectory. From a macroeconomic perspective, the markets continue to benefit from the unprecedented monetary and fiscal support by central banks and governments globally. In the third quarter, the Federal Reserve announced its new approach to average inflation targeting and forecasted that short-term rates would remain locked near zero for the next several years. In that same vein, in the U.K. where the economy is expected to contract by over 9% this year, the Bank of England opened the door to negative rates as a potential policy tool.  Meanwhile, U.S. labor markets continue to show headline improvement with the unemployment rate declining to 7.9% in September, down nearly 50% from peak levels in April, reflecting approximately 13 million people out of work. That said, according to the latest job reports, those improvements were largely driven by reversals of temporary layoffs, while permanent job losses have risen to nearly 4 million people, reflecting some of the deeper challenges in our economy.  Additionally, there continues to be enormous uncertainty globally in the trajectory of the virus, which may impact the pace of the economic recovery as we head into the fall and winter. In particular, we see continued challenges in a number of impacted industries, including restaurants, hospitality, and oil and gas.  Despite these uncertainties, since our July earnings call our economists' expectations for 2020 U.S. GDP improved by 120 basis points to an expected contraction of 3.4%, while global growth estimates slipped 50 basis points to an expected 3.9% contraction. Looking into next year, estimates have strengthened with expected growth of nearly 6% in the U.S. and 7% globally.  In spite of the ongoing challenges, we are seeing higher global equity markets and tighter credit spreads, perhaps as a reflection of the speed of economic recovery. During the third quarter, the S&P 500 rallied by 8%, touching new highs in September and leaving the index up 4% for the year. This yearly gain, however, was concentrated in the top five tech companies, which rose 42%, while the remaining 495 names in the index declined by 2%.  Equity market volatility also remains elevated with the average VIX this quarter more than 60% higher than the third quarter a year ago, though well below levels seen in March and April. On the credit front, U.S. investment grade spreads tightened by roughly 20 basis points and high yield spreads tightened by almost 90 basis points during this quarter. As we go forward, we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weakness in the broader economy. Given the uncertain macro environment, we are focused on serving our clients to help them navigate this evolving backdrop. Before turning to Stephen, I'd like to spend a moment on our approach to return to office. We have employed a number of new protocols to operate as safely as possible around the world. We do this as public and private healthcare organizations work tirelessly to develop therapies and vaccines, which I fully believe in time will allow all of us to return to a more normalized environment. We are focused on helping our people come back safely as being together enables greater collaboration, which is key to our culture. We continue to employ an adaptable approach which considers individual circumstances and local health recommendations to give our people the flexibility and the tools they need to return to the office safely.  We continue to make measured progress. In Hong Kong and Tokyo, we have around 60% of our people working from the office. In most of Europe, we're at around 50%, and in the U.K. we're at nearly 30%. In New York, we've seen a gradual uptick since Labor Day with roughly 2,000 people working in office as of last week, and we currently have 30% of our people rotating through the New York office on a weekly basis. That said, we will continue to be nimble and remain in close contact with the relevant authorities in cities where we operate and are ready to shift gears if the evolving situation with COVID-19 warrants. Under all circumstances, we continue to keep the health and safety of our people as a top priority. In closing, I would like to thank the people of Goldman Sachs who have remained dedicated to serving our clients while managing the firm's risk, liquidity and capital to ensure our ongoing financial strength and operational resiliency. While 2020 has been a difficult year in many ways, I'm incredibly pleased with the state of our client franchise and progress we've made in executing on our strategic priorities, and I look forward to providing a more comprehensive update on our investor day goals at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen. Christian, I appreciate the question, and of course we laid out a medium-term plan with a set of goals, and you and others continue to ask us about this. We're on a journey to continue to strengthen our returns and broaden our business to create a more diverse business with more sustainable revenues over time. We now have the business, we think, fully set up and organized after we re-segmented last year and made some changes internally so that the platforms that we think we can really operate from are well positioned to grow, and this includes our two more traditional platforms that everybody is always focused on, investment banking and global markets, which really for lack of a better term is a corporate investment bank. We have a big asset management platform which is global, broad, deep, multi-product all over the world, and we think there are opportunities to continue to grow that organically for sure, but certainly we'd consider inorganic opportunities to grow that if we thought that they were enhancing.  And then, we obviously are building a broader consumer wealth platform to serve individuals and we certainly think there can be opportunities to accelerate the growth of that. In fact, last year we made an acquisition in United Capital that we think accelerated our expansion into high net worth wealth in a meaningful way, and we've now been integrating that quite successfully. So we continue to look broadly at things that can extend our strategy and accelerate the pace. It's clear if you look at the actions of others that the market has been tolerant of tangible book value dilution in the context of something they think is on strategy and advances the trajectory of the business, so we'll continue to look and see if there are opportunities; but other than that, it would be hard for me to say anything more at this point. I'll start and Stephen might give some more granular detail, but I'd say that at a high level, Michael, and appreciate the question, there's no question that our efficiency has benefited from an environment which has allowed us an opportunity in some of our businesses to capture more revenues, and some of that, as Stephen highlighted, is really due to market share gains and we think that will be more sticky. Some of it is due to the environment. There is no question as we looked at our three-year trajectory and thinking about our desire to run the firm more efficiently that this environment and the crisis slowed down some of the actions we might have taken during this year. We've now begun to deal with some things from an efficiency perspective that we might have dealt with earlier in the year, and we then have two more years to go through and execute that plan.  We continue to be very committed to that plan. We continue to be very comfortable with that plan. We actually think there might be things that we've seen or we're learned that may create more opportunities for us to advance from that plan, but at this point our intention is to give you a more detailed granular update when we review our plan in January at the next earnings call. Stephen, is there anything you'd want to add to that? There's no question that earlier in the year, given the dramatic nature of the start of the pandemic and the uncertainty that persisted, M&A activity came to a screeching halt, and really through the second quarter, new announcements and activity levels were quite low. Stephen made comments with respect to the pick-up in our backlog. We've seen an increase in activity. I think we see an increase in activity and announcements but also an increased dialog, and I would say that CEO confidence has improved meaningfully in the quarter. It's still not at the high elevated levels that might have been at the beginning of the year, but CEO confidence and the dialog we're having is certainly improved.  Against that backdrop, I would expect to see numerous companies trying to take advantage of the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen position. I think one of the things that's going on in the crisis is people are seeing that there continues to be efficiency in scale. As the world continues to digitize, it requires greater investment, and that obviously advantages companies with scale.  Our base case, based on what we're seeing, is that his increase in activity will continue through the rest of the year into 2021, but I would say that you've got to be flexible and understand that if for some reason, the course of the pandemic or the economic trajectory changes some of that confidence that's currently building, that could slow down, but at the moment activity levels appear quite good. Okay, so a couple things. First, and I just want to be very clear about it, it's one article. I saw the article. The article was wrong, it was incorrect. We've never considered changing our targets. There's been no discussion about it, so we're committed to our targets and we're making progress on our targets. I don't have anything really else to say about the article, other than it was incorrect.  With respect to the second part of your question, and I'm sorry - I'm now on the third part of your question, where you're asking about deposits. There was something in the middle, right? Oh, about-- Sure, so when you look at deposits--that's right, deposit growth and loan growth. When you look at deposit growth, what I'd say, and we talked about this in last quarter's call, deposit growth and the acceleration of our ability to attract digital deposits definitely accelerated during this year because of the pandemic, faster than we had expected. We've obviously been managing that flow, and you saw in this quarter based on actions we took that we slowed down the growth in that deposit rate because we had well exceeded what we expected to do for the year.  At the same point in time, when you look at the consumer business which still remains very, very small, as we entered the pandemic we had the ability to be more controlled on the growth of that portfolio. We remain committed to the targets we set out in our investor day in January, but it didn't seem as we entering the pandemic and there was such uncertainty during the bulk of this year, that we should be leaning in toward driving those targets. My expectation would be if the economic environment continues to improve, you'll see an improvement in that loan growth as we head into 2021, but we'll continue to monitor that appropriately and cautiously. Brennan, at a high level, and Stephen made comments on this too, but at a high level as we develop different businesses, and Stephen pointed to this, we're developing businesses that have a different component of people cost than some of our businesses had had historically. When we set a comp ratio, we are always thinking based on the information we have at the time what do we think is necessary to pay our people competitively and protect our franchise. PCLs are a cost of doing business. It's a reflection of the capital that's embedded in the businesses, and it obviously affects that judgement. In a year where there were very, very low PCLs, the difference between those two ratios is very little. In a year where there are very significant PCLs, given the nature of the time we're on in the cycle, obviously there's a big difference and that will weigh more heavily in those years. But we continue to see real operating leverage in our business as we execute on our strategy, as things continue to digitize and we continue to automate, but in addition we have excellent people in a number of businesses that need to be paid when people perform, and we'll stay very, very focused on making sure that we're competitively and well positioned, but you're seeing some of the operating leverage come through on the business. Well you know, Devin, I think you've laid this out very well. We've put out a plan, we believe we're executing. We've got a lot more work to do. If we execute, I assume the stock will follow, and we're focused on shareholder value. We're focused on the medium to longer term, and I feel good--we feel good as a leadership team as to how we're progressing. But there's more work to do and our assumption is if we continue to deliver consistently over the medium and longer term, shareholders will benefit and the stock price will perform. There's no focus in strategy or how the business should be run. One of the things that I believe very strongly and that we've been driving toward as a management team since we took over as a management team two years ago was getting the way we talk about the business to be set up in a way where we could transparently talk about our different big business platforms, and to have those businesses aligned with the way we were running the business internally. That is not something that traditionally we had. We had external segments, we had different divisions internally.  We made segment shifts at the end of last year to set up the platforms the way we expected to run them, and the announcements we made now get people who are driving the strategy and moving those platforms forward aligned with the way we talk about the businesses to you, to the investing community, to our shareholders, and we feel that's an important step forward. So there's no change, but rather just a continuation of the journey we've been on to get the firm aligned up and set up now with these four big platforms that we really think we can drive growth over time. There was a lot there, Mike, and so if I--I appreciate all the questions, if I don't get them all. I just want to highlight, I don't remember the book because I didn't go to business school.  But as I try to pick through and answer, first on M&A backlog, I think Stephen said this, while M&A backlog strengthened during the quarter, it's not back to where it was at the beginning of the year, and it's certainly not at its all-time high.  With respect to market share gains, in global markets I think the market share gains, we believe as a management team that the market share gains are rooted in an evolution back of our strategy to really being very, very client centric, our One GS approach, and really trying to think about how we as an organization deliver for our clients in a very central way. This is core to the way we're running the whole firm. It's been a big initiative over the last two years, and we think it's having a real impact on the way our clients interact with us and our ability to serve our clients, and we think that's helping our market share. Certainly the volume levels, I think at this moment in time, are elevated, the overall activity levels are elevated to some degree based on the pandemic and the volatility in markets. But I think the market share is coming from the way we're executing a strategy, and we began that focus well before COVID. We began that focus two years ago, and I think we're really getting results from that investment. The third thing with respect to the credit card business, it's hard to imagine we're in any business that has a lower PE than the current PE that we trade at, but when you look at our vision for what we're trying to do in building a digital consumer platform that marries our strong expertise in wealth while also providing a digital experience for general banking services for consumers, we're committed to it, we believe in it, but we want to be perfectly clear - this is something that's going to be built over a long period of time, just like we announced today with an extraordinary franchise where we have over $2 trillion of assets under supervision. That's been built over a very long period of time, and we believe it's really accreted to the value of Goldman Sachs and our shareholders over a very long period of time. We're going to continue to work at this cautiously. I know there's skepticism out there. We're going to prove over time as to why we think it's right, and we'll continue to advance it. Well, I think your last statement is true, but I'll make a couple of other comments at a high level and it would offer a perspective. I know, Mike, you'd have a perspective on this too. For sure we're going to continue to focus on performing, and I think over time it will take care of itself. At a high level, the banking sector and financials broadly are well out of favor, so it's not as though we're sitting in a unique position. If you look at the people that you would benchmark us against and you look at how they trade on a relative basis, people are pretty clustered in the neighborhood. Is that something that I think is permanent? No, I don't think it's permanent. Can you and I both speculate as to reasons why people feel that way at this point in the cycle, and with some of the uncertainty? Absolutely. I do think, to your point, the client franchise and the capital markets revenues that we have are, if you're looking at it not quarter to quarter but over periods of time as a franchise business, there is volatility in it compared to some businesses, but over any meaningful period of time, they generate lots of revenues, lots of earnings very consistently, so part of it depends on the frame through which you look. We can certainly go back over long periods of time and see how the client franchise and the strength of the client franchise continues to do well. We really believe when we focus on clients, that revenue will be sustained in the context of the market opportunity. As a business, we operate in a business that might have more short term volatility than some other businesses that are out there, that people benchmark in some way. I think it's an interesting time because of the pandemic and the uncertainty, so I think that hurts the overall neighborhood; but I continue to believe that we have big platforms, we have scale, we have leadership positions, those things are sticky. The things that we do are not going to go away, and if we focus on our clients and delivering for shareholders over time, I believe the stock price will follow. Jim, I think it's a hard thing. I think it's a hard thing to look at and predict with granularity. There's no question that the environment pulled forward--both pulled forward some financing for companies and also created a whole bunch of financings that, if we didn't have this environment, it wouldn't have happened. There's no question that financing levels have been elevated during this year. At the same point in time, if again--and this goes back to my point as people think about this, if we get out of the mode of kind of thinking quarter to quarter to quarter, and we look at these as huge franchises where we have leading share and we're well positioned, I believe over any period of time - three years, five years, seven years, 10 year - there's going to be enormous corporate financing activity and we will have leading share in participating in that, and that will be a big profitable business that will enhance our franchise and help drive earnings growth and book value growth. So in the short term, it's hard for me to speculate. I mean, I would speculate that if things normalize, which I expect them to, we will not see the same velocity of financing in 2021 that we saw in 2020 as people tried to adapt and finance themselves out to create more runway, given the uncertainty in the environment. Again, big franchise, big opportunity, and whatever the market puts forward, I think we're well positioned to serve our clients and capture it. I appreciate that question, Jim. The progress is going quite well, and I think one of the things that I know is self evident to everybody on the call, as market cap grows, there are more and more companies that grow into being worth $500 million, a billion, $2 billion that have never been on our radar screen, so that footprint has expanded meaningfully and there's been hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue accretion based on the opportunity set that's come from that, and I think that will continue.  I feel good about the way that platform expansion is going, and I think there continues to be more opportunity for us over time to continue to add to that footprint. I think, Mike, that I'm not going to say anything in response to this that's different to what I said just a few minutes ago. We are making investments to grow our business, our asset management business organically. Certainly the strategy we've laid out in alternatives and the mix shift and the way we're approaching that is an organic effort. We certainly are aware of the continued consolidation that's going on in the asset management industry. We feel very well positioned as a very, very large global, broad and deep active asset manager. As opportunities come up, we'll consider them if we think they can enhance our franchise and allow us to expand the strength of our franchise and our ability to serve our institutional clients, and also individual clients through our wealth business. To the degree that we thought something would really enhance our ability to drive that platform, we would take on the goodwill that was necessary to do it. We're not afraid of that. We haven't seen the right opportunity for us at the moment, and so we'll continue to grow the business organically. If the right thing came along inorganically, we'd take a very hard look at it."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the third quarter, the firm performed well across all four of our business segments. In investment banking, our corporate clients remained very active in raising debt and equity capital. We also saw an increase in strategic dialog following a more dormant period for M&A activity earlier in the year. In global markets, client engagement remained high as we gained share during the year and enabled clients to manage risks across asset classes. In asset management, strong growth was driven by higher management and other fees as well as gains from our long-term equity and credit investments following a more challenged first half of the year. We also saw double-digit revenue growth in our consumer and wealth management segment as we expand our service offering to individuals across the wealth spectrum. With those headlines, let me now turn to our specific business performance on Page 4, beginning with investment banking. Investment banking produced third quarter net revenues of nearly $2 billion, up 7% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $507 million declined 27% versus last year on fewer transaction closings in the quarter, reflecting the lower level of client activity in the first half of the year. Nevertheless, year to date we participated in over $630 billion of announced transactions and closed approximately 225 deals for $810 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A lead tables by a meaningful margin. Importantly, the pace of M&A announcements has picked up considerably in recent months. Our announced deal volume in the third quarter was up more than fivefold versus the second quarter and our investment banking client dialogs remain active. The bigger headline in investment banking, again in the third quarter, was equity underwriting where we generated $856 million in revenues, more than double the levels seen a year ago, marking our second highest quarter ever. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting as our year-to-date volumes climbed to $80 billion across 436 deals, including 77 initial public offerings. In global IPOs, we ranked number one and picked up approximately 180 basis points of market share versus last year. We also saw strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in 21 private transactions, a high profile direct listing, and a number of SPAC IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in various forms.  In debt underwriting, net revenues were $571 million, up 9% from a year ago. Though volumes normalized from the record pace seen in the second quarter, the high yield market in particular saw healthy levels of new issue activity. Our activity also included a number of novel structure transactions, particularly among industries most impacted by COVID-19 such as airlines, where we uniquely enabled clients to leverage a broader collateral base to access capital. As a result, we've been able to support our clients and grow our market share, generating a solid number four ranking in global debt underwriting year to date. This performance reflects our long-term strategic focus on this business as well as the velocity of underwriting commitments on our balance sheet. Looking forward, our investment banking backlog increased significantly versus the second quarter. Growth was supported by a ramp in M&A activity, as I noted earlier, as well as replenishment from equity and debt underwriting transactions. In particular, new M&A announcements are creating a pipeline for acquisition financing in the coming quarters. We are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FIG, consumer, healthcare, and industrials. Revenues from corporate lending were $35 million, reflecting lower results in relationship lending which includes the impact of tighter credit spreads on hedges. As I have noted before, for risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger lending commitments. Given the significant credit spread tightening over the last two quarters, we have now reversed the vast majority of the $375 million in hedge gains we saw in the first quarter. Also of note in relationship lending, we have seen material pay downs versus the first half. Total notional drawn on revolvers is now down 60% from the peak and nearing normalized levels. Moving to global markets on Page 5, where our businesses continued their strong performance, net revenues were $4.6 billion in the third quarter, up 29% versus a year ago amid attractive bid-offer spreads, a supportive market making backdrop, and continued elevated client activity.  We expanded our market share this year as our focus and commitment to serve clients during this volatile period drove results across asset classes and geographies. During the first half, McKinsey reported that Goldman Sachs Global Markets delivered the best institutional client performance among our global peers. Our strength was aided by number one rankings in both G10 rates and credit and the number one global ranking in equities, which included the number one position in EMEA and ties for number one in Asia and Japan. Turning to FIC on Page 6, third quarter net revenues were $2.5 billion, up 49% versus the third quarter of '19. Growth versus last year was driven by a 65% increase in intermediation, which more than offset a 9% decrease in financing revenues. In FIC intermediation, we had solid client flows and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year, leveraging our balance sheet to intermediate risk in a disciplined way.  In credit, performance was supported by strong client activity in the U.S. and tighter investment grade and high yield credit spreads. We also saw sustained volumes across our automated bond pricing engine.  In rates, revenues rose amid stronger risk management while client activity was solid, particularly around global central bank actions during the quarter. In commodities, strong performance was driven by our metals business and oil products amid persistent global supply imbalances. In mortgages, revenues rose amid higher levels of client activity in agency products, bolstered by solid risk management and tighter spreads.  In currencies, revenues were stable as we continued to serve our global client franchise with contributions across both G10 and emerging markets. Lastly in FIC financing, we saw lower revenues in repo and structured finance. Turning to equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $2.1 billion, up 10% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36%, aided by higher client volumes across derivatives and cash, reflecting the scale and breadth of our client franchise. In derivatives, we saw solid activity in flow, structured, and corporate transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. In cash, we helped clients execute across both high and low touch channels. Equities financing revenues of $585 million declined 25% year over year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, average client balances rose to near record levels. Across global markets, we continued to invest in technology platforms to enhance client experience, build on our strength in risk management, and drive resource efficiencies. Like digital trends across many industries, COVID-19 has accelerated client adoption and on-boarding across our automated platforms. While it remains difficult to predict client activity and we do not have insight into the forward opportunity, we take confidence in the market share gains experienced by the business through a deepening set of client relationships, which has been a priority for the global markets leadership team. This progress should support revenue sustainability as we go forward. We also believe the upcoming U.S. election, the variability of economic growth outlook, and the 2021 global LIBOR transition may bolster client activity across markets. Additionally, to the extent that sustained low interest rates have their intended effect of stimulating economic growth and recovery, client activity may be further invigorated. Moving to asset management on Page 7, in the third quarter we generated segment revenues of $2.8 billion, up over 70% versus a year ago. Our third quarter revenues were driven by the continued market rebound, event-driven activity, and positive corporate performance of our portfolio companies. Management and other fees totaled $728 million, up 10% versus a year ago driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower fee rate due to mix shift given growth in liquidity and fixed income products.  Equity investments produced $1.4 billion of net gains, aided by appreciation in our public investments and valuation marks related to event-driven activity across our private equity portfolio. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated nearly $800 million in gains from investments, including BigCommerce, Avantor, Sprout, and HeadHunter. On our $16 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of more than $400 million from various positions, with the majority driven by events including corporate actions such as fundraisings, capital markets activities, and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $230 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities.  Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $589 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected mostly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments which continued to rebound from the broader market sell-off in the first quarter.  Let me now turn to Page 8, where we continue to provide transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet.  On the left side of this slide is our equity investment portfolio by sector, geography and vintage. Our private portfolio remains highly diversified with over 800 positions where excluding Global Atlantic, given its announced sale, none are larger than $425 million. We also provide insight into our $21 billion portfolio of CIEs primarily comprised of real estate investments, of which $12 billion are financed predominantly by non-recourse debt. The portfolio remains diversified by geography and real estate sector. On the right side of the slide, we show our $31 billion in lending and debt investments in the portfolio within the asset management segment, which includes $14 billion of debt investments and $17 billion of loans that are largely secured.  I'll now turn to consumer and wealth management on Page 9. In this segment, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the third quarter, up 13% versus a year ago, driven by higher wealth management AUS and higher consumer banking revenues. Wealth management and other fees of $957 million rose 9% versus last year, reflecting increased client transaction activity and higher assets under supervision, which rose 8% to $575 billion, including $24 billion of positive net inflows over the past 12 months.  Consumer banking revenues were a record $326 million in the third quarter, jumping 50% versus last year, reflecting net interest income from credit card lending, strong year over year deposit growth, and lower deposit rates. Consumer deposit totaled $96 billion, reflecting $4 billion of growth in the quarter. The slower pace was expected as we continued to limit U.K. new account growth in light of regulatory caps and reduced the rate on our U.S. market savings accounts given the lower interest rate environment. While we exhibited improving beta in our deposit book, we saw very limited outflows of deposits consistent with our expectations, despite two rate cuts during the quarter.  Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7 billion, of which approximately $4 billion were from Marcus loans and $3 billion from Apple Card. We continue to prudently risk manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates. While we remain attentive to the embedded risk, we continue to be pleased with the credit performance of these portfolios.  Next, let's turn to Page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS decreased slightly to $2 trillion during the quarter, but are up approximately $275 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by $90 billion of liquidity outflows following strong inflows in the first half, that offset by $51 billion of market appreciation and $18 billion of long term inflows.  On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.1 billion for the third quarter, up versus a year ago primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet particularly in global markets, as well as the benefit from deposit growth and re-pricing in consumer and wealth management. Importantly, as I have noted in the past, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. Our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets and predominantly hedged or floating rate liabilities. Nevertheless, even if interest rates remain low, we expect NII to gradually expand over time given our ability to prudently grow loans and further re-price consumer deposits. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $112 billion, down $5 billion sequentially driven by a $7 billion decrease in corporate loans from pay downs in relationship lending and a $1 billion reduction in Marcus installment loans, offset by modest growth in wealth management and credit card loans.  Our provision for credit losses in the third quarter was $278 million, meaningfully lower than the $1.59 billion taken last quarter and down 4% versus a year ago. This lower provision versus the second quarter reflects relative stability in our portfolio and improvements in the broader economic backdrop, which is the dominant driver of inputs to our modeling of pool reserves.  At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loan and commitments stood at $4.3 billion, including $3.7 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was stable versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $100 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 16.1%. The provision of $278 million includes wholesale impairments of approximately $230 million primarily relating to select credits in the TMT, industrials, and natural resources sectors. During the quarter, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $340 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 1.3%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter.  Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 12.  Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6 billion increased 6% versus last year, with compensation expenses up 14% year-over-year amidst higher revenue growth net of provisions, and non-compensation expenses down 2%. Higher compensation expenses reflected year-over-year growth in revenue net of credit provisions. Our non-comp expenses were slightly lower versus last year as we continued to invest in new businesses, including transaction banking and credit card as well as the United Capital acquisition, now rebranded Personal Financial Management.  While we benefited from lower expenses of approximately $100 million from the temporary reduction in travel, entertainment and advertising expenses due to COVID-19, we also saw an approximately $90 million reduction in litigation and professional fees and a roughly $50 million reduction in double occupancy-related costs from our new facilities in London and Bangalore. These were offset by a roughly $60 million increase in activity related expense from brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees, as well as a roughly $85 million increase related to technology investments across the firm. Our reported year to date efficiency ratio was 69.6%, which was burdened by nearly 10 percentage points of litigation expense. We continue to make progress on our expense savings initiatives as set forth at investor day and will continue to assess our ability to go further than what we outlined in January. Finally, our reported tax rate was 28% for the year to date, reflecting the impact of non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% over the next few years. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio improved to 14.5% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 120 basis points sequentially. The improvement was driven primarily by earnings as well as lower market RWAs, reflecting reduced market volatility, and lower credit RWAs. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 110 basis points to 13%, also on earnings and RWA reductions from lower market volatility.  We are confident in our capital position, now 90 basis points above our 13.6% stress capital buffer requirement. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at investor day is appropriate for our firm on a medium term basis as we execute our strategic initiatives, build more durable fee-based revenues, and reduce the stress loss intensity of our business. To that end, we will continue asset harvesting, including our announced sale of Global Atlantic.  While our capital ratio will likely remain elevated near term given continued regulatory restrictions on share repurchases, we would expect our management buffer to decline over time, particularly as markets express less volatility. Importantly, we stand ready to commit capital and balance sheet to support our clients, and we expect to resume share repurchases once permitted consistent with our longstanding capital management policy. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, roughly flat versus last quarter. We maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $302 billion, up modestly versus last quarter, reflecting the current backdrop. We expect our GCLA will evolve in the context of client demand for our balance sheet and overall market conditions.  On the liability side, our total deposits decreased to $261 billion, down $8 billion versus last quarter driven by planned roll-off of higher cost brokered deposits and more modest growth in retail deposits. Our long term debt declined by $9 billion during the quarter, driven by maturities. We expect issuance to remain relatively low for the remainder of the year, although we may consider pre-funding some planned first quarter 2021 issuances. In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, and flexibility in our highly liquid balance sheet. Despite the continued overhang from COVID-19 and challenges from the work-from-home environment, we continue to leverage our technology platforms and intellectual capital to support our clients.  During this difficult time, we remain dedicated to executing our strategy in our core business and driving forward the new initiatives and operating efficiency programs we laid out in January. Importantly, we have been proud to see our dedicated client engagement efforts continue to pay off, resulting in gains in mind share and market share as we help clients navigate this volatile environment. On the forward, our risk managers will remain in a conservative posture given the uncertain trajectory of the virus and early stages of the recovery to ensure we are well positioned to proactively support our clients.  While our path to our medium term targets will inevitably not be a straight line, we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues, and higher returns for shareholders over time. With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions. Sure Glenn, thanks. I would say the performance of the trading businesses in the third quarter, frankly like it was in throughout most of the first part of the year was really done with an eye toward high velocity turn on balance sheet; that is, we were very well prepared to commit capital to facilitate intermediation but saw our mission equally as moving and trading on that risk very efficiently, and so we could see the kind of turnover that we needed. We didn't see dramatic pick-up in risk occasioned by that pattern and that strategy, and I think that leaves us in a good position with respect to what we will submit as part of the second version of CCAR, and I don't see our risk as being unusually elevated in the context of producing these kinds of results. Sure, no problem. Let me just go through the breakdown in equities. Of the $1.4 billion in revenue, our public portfolio generated $781 million in revenue, and the private part of the equity portfolio generated $642 million. Now importantly, when you look at the private portfolio, $284 million of that $642 million was generated on events, so that's sales, monetizations, IPOs, and the like, and $52 million - only $52 million - was non-event driven, that is looking at the baseline performance of the underlying company and making a judgement about where value is appropriately pegged, and so event being the dominant component of the private portfolio. The balance, I should point out, of $306 million relates to CIEs. As it relates to the public portfolio, we observe the market no differently than you do. Obviously, there's a certain component of that public portfolio that remains restricted. A decent amount of it remains unrestricted, and we will look for opportunities as we have been to monetize those stakes. By the way, I say that not just simply in the context of an attractive market valuation in which to sell but equally in the context of the kind of broader strategic mission we've been on, which is to lower the balance sheet intensity and capital intensity of that as we shift to more third party investing itself, and so that you a bit of the lay of the land as to the two components to your question. Sure. Sure, so why don't I start with trading. I think at the core, our view on sustainability is not with a crystal ball and a forward forecast as to what the opportunity set will be. It is more rooted in the fact that over the course of the year and looking at data through the first half, we have picked up meaningful market share in and among various client sets across all of the businesses in our trading business. This was a very concerted effort on the part of the leadership of that business to go at finding ourselves moving up the ladder in the top 1,000 clients that matter to the trading division. The sustainability of our performance for me is rooted more in the fact that we've picked up share gains. We were there for clients particularly during the most volatile moments of the second quarter across all asset classes without withdrawing, and I think it sets us up to capture whatever the opportunity set is on the forward.  My comments in the prepared remarks is that as I look forward to the fourth quarter, we can count on any number of issues to be the source of some volatility, whether that's U.S. election, LIBOR transition, the trajectory of COVID - any one of those, and part of the reason that we are at capital levels we are, part of the reason we have maintained higher liquidity than we ordinarily would, is such that we can serve clients should that volatility occur without putting ourselves offside on any one of those metrics. I think that's part of the color I'd give you both in terms of what's sustainable, and equally why we feel confident that we've put our financial resources in a proper frame to play on the volatility itself. Just lastly on your question about LIBOR transition, we've had a dedicated team - I mean, people who are 100% dedicated to this effort from the beginning. We've put ourselves in a position where we've done issuance, we have prepared ourselves in terms of counterparty contracts and the like, and I think we're very well prepared. Obviously, we don't skew in ways in which commercial banks do with LIBOR based elements in mortgages and the like, but in the scope of what is our business, we feel quite well prepared for that onset. You know, Mike, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that I think that on the forward, we're going to continue to look at strategic value locations as areas where we can grow and develop a number of different businesses, particularly the newer ones. I would say automation continues to be a priority for us across the whole of the firm - you know, automating what goes on in risk and the various control functions, and equally automating platforms that have captured the attention of client sets. I'd also say that--look, it's hard to look at one quarter as a spot for efficiency. Obviously it's important to look out the whole year, but equally this is a medium term journey that we're on, and I think some of those will--some of the items that I mentioned, that David mentioned will bear fruit in terms of creating greater operating leverage.  The last thing I'd say is that we have said on prior earnings calls that it's important to look at operating expenses in totality because as we continue to build businesses like transaction banking, like the consumer business, they will be less human intensive, they will be more automate, and therefore we move away from the compensation intensity associated with those businesses as a general matter. I think there are a number of levers to pull over the medium term. Sure, so as we looked across the portfolio and we did it in the first quarter, did it in the second and again did it in the third, we look at those that are most acutely impacted by COVID. Their circumstance in some sense hasn't changed, and they remain untouched from the downward mark pressure and valuation that we saw in the first and second quarter. There are others that have turned the corner as being affected by COVID, and that is as much a function of where the market is moving, where consumers are moving and the like. Then there are others that historically have been untouched by this, and so I would say we continue to look at it through the frame of COVID impact and equally we look obviously at the underlying performance of the business, and not exclusively as against public market comparables and the like. By the way, this is of course for that part of the private portfolio not otherwise marked, given other events that are going on, so that frame remains the same in terms of how we look at that portfolio itself. Sure. I think we've brought our CET1 ratio to 14.5% really to sort of fix ourselves in a competitive position in anticipation, as I said, of the potential for volatility and higher trading over the course of the fourth quarter. We've said before and I'll say again that we run roughly with a 50 to 100 basis point buffer. Where within that range we stand, obviously at the higher end now, is equally a function of volatility from a risk management point of view - that is, we're in a market that is more likely to express higher, not lower. As and to the extent that that volatility subsides, we will see the buffer come down and will adjust, again consistent with where we are. On the longer term trend, over the medium to longer term, the reinforcement of 13% to 13.5% is more a reflection, I think as I've said in the comments, of a forward direction to create, and as David noted, lower stress loss impact in the overall composition of the business, meaning as we continue to pursue certain of our strategic initiatives which create more durable fee-based revenue, lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet intensity, we'll be in a position where I think the requirement of us will come down and therefore over the medium term, we'll move more in that direction. Loans. Lending versus our expectations before the pandemic. Brennan, I would just point out that through three quarters, when you look at comp as a percentage of revenue net of provisions, we are spot on to where we were last year, and so there's obviously no change in philosophy. I think David gave you all the reasons why it's important that we take stock of provisions in the context of looking at that. I would say, though, more generally it's important to focus on the efficiency ratio of the firm over an extended period of time, because as I said earlier, comp will be inevitably but one component of a set of operating expenses by which the firm is carrying itself, so I think efficiency ratio will be a better indicator of the firm's ability to manage.  But that's not to ignore the focus and the view into comp as an expense, and so I think part of what David and I have told you gives you a sense of how we're looking at it relative to provisions and where it sits on a year-to-date basis. Devin, the only thing I would add, just to touch on the specifics of performance within the consumer business, so overall the Marcus unsecured loans closed the quarter at a lower balance than where it began the year, and Apple Card balances were higher than where we ended the year. Both of those were very purposeful in the context of managing through a young portfolio in an uncertain moment with respect to the consumer. I would also say that the loss behavior, if you will, or the credit behavior of that portfolio is outperforming our modeled expectations; that is, losses have been coming down relative to that which was otherwise budgeted or forecasted, which is as much a function of how we've managed underwriting on the entry, how we've managed customers under customer assistance plans and the like, so that just gives you a sense of where performance lies in the context of David's comments. You know, Mike, an interesting development, just to amplify on David's comment, which is that even in the trading businesses, which one could argue are volatile in the context of the market, on certain of the electronic platforms that we're seeing, and I would speak specifically about the credit platform, we are seeing an increasing number of our clients come to those platforms, transact on those platforms. Now, that may be a function of work-from-home and the disposition of those clients, but we're seeing a growing presence. Their attachment to those platforms, whether it's marquee or otherwise, is sticky and tends to stay there, perhaps even more than what you might see in a high touch versus low touch. Getting into that in a business that you would not otherwise expect to be as predictable, if you will, I think is just something to take note in the context of your question. Yes, so I think on one hand, if you look on a year-over-year basis, it's a question of volatility, so we'd see it higher than not by virtue of volatility; otherwise, on a quarter on quarter basis, you see the positional set change, reduce exposure, certain diversification effect which plays to the positive, so there was no meaningful uptick in risk in the context of where RWA deployment otherwise was. Sure. Well, I think over the medium term, I think if you look at the various initiatives that we articulated at investor day and are executing on now, whether it is transaction banking, the consumer business, what we're doing with respect to our alts business, all of those will reduce the stress loss intensity of our business overall. Transaction banking will be a fee generating proposition. The alternatives business equally will give us a more durable thread of fees, and at the same time take down the capital and balance sheet intensity that otherwise weighs on the capital calculation. I think all of those are geared with an eye toward reducing down, as I said, stress loss intensity and ultimately leading to a lower SCB itself. Okay, since there are no more questions in the queue, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather; otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today July 15, 2020. Thank you, Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.\nHeather Kennedy Miner: Thanks, Dennis. Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Today I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr. David will start by reviewing the second quarter and first half performance. He will then provide an update on several key strategic growth initiatives and the macro economic backdrop. David will also address the firm's commitment to diversity and discuss our return to office strategy. Stephen will then discuss the recent stress test and our second quarter results in greater detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I'll now pass the call over to David. David? David Solomon Thanks, Heather, and thank you, everyone for joining this call this morning. I would like to start by saying that all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you, your friends and your family remain safe and healthy during this unprecedented global health crisis. Let me begin on Page one of the presentation to review our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $13.3 billion up 41% versus a year ago. The strength and breadth of our client franchise was evident this quarter as we delivered solid net earnings of $2.4 billion, earnings per share of $6.26, and a return on equity of 11.1% and return on tangible equity of 11.8%. Our results in the quarter were strong, even while incurring higher credit provisions and litigation expenses, both of which impacted our returns. Our second quarter results contributed to solid first half 2020 revenues of $22 billion net earnings of $3.6 billion, and an ROE of 8.4% and ROTE of 9%. Litigation cost burdened our first half returns by approximately 280 basis points. Returns were also impacted by higher reserve build for credit losses. The second quarter demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and was driven by significant new issue volumes and the counter cyclical performance of our market making activities. We maintained our leading position as a strategic advisor of choice for investment banking clients and our strong lead table positions across underwriting markets, with extraordinary volumes and both debt and equity enabling us to pick up market share. We delivered exceptional performance in FICC and equities on high levels of client activity, to point our risk intermediation expertise in our balance sheet on behalf of clients in a volatile market. We continue to provide high-quality advice to our wealth management clients and generated another quarter of solid consumer deposit growth. In asset management we recognize gains from market appreciation and our public investments; continue to harvest private equity positions and experience the partial recovery in our credit portfolio from the first quarter. Importantly, we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with an improving capital position and then high levels of market volatility and economic stress. Turning to the operating environment on Page two. We are navigating uncertain macroeconomic backdrop brought on by an extraordinary global health crisis. During the second quarter, we experienced both positive and negative forces, reflecting the near term economic challenges related to recent business shutdowns, counterbalanced by continued support from central banks and governments and market optimism as certain economies began to reopen. However, as we speak today, the past three opening in many U.S. states and corresponding economic consequences remain unclear. Since our April earnings call, our economists estimates for 2020 U.S. GDP improved from expected contraction in 2020 of 6.2% to 4.6% today, driven by expectations of a faster rebound from a deeper trough. That says on a global basis, growth expectations for 2020 deteriorated from an expected 2.5% decline in April to a 3.4% contraction expected today with the second quarter, reflecting a deeper decline in activity than expected three months ago. The prospect for a steeper recovery in the second half is in no small part due to the forceful and rapid action by governments central banks and governments by global central banks and governments, which are providing exceptional levels of liquidity and ongoing fiscal stimulus. These actions have been key to market resilience, tempering the economic impact of the virus. In the United States, we are seeing early indications of economic improvement, including the better than expected 18% rebound in retail sales and notable improvement in unemployment June to approximately 11% for more elevated numbers in May. As markets assess the impact of the virus in the second quarter and its potential economic consequence, we experienced the rise in the valuation of risk assets. During the second quarter the S&P 500 rallied by 20%, marking its best quarter since 1998. While broader global equity markets rose a similar amount, investment credit spreads tightened by over 80 basis points and high yield spreads tightened by roughly 140 basis points this quarter. In the context of these moves in financial assets, strong levels of client engagement during the second quarter demonstrate the breadth and the strength of our franchise. As we go forward as risk managers, we continue to prepare for the prolonged economic challenges and look beyond market valuations in our overall assessment of risk. We maintain a strong financial profile and we remain agile with our balance sheet as we continue to serve our clients. Pivoting for a moment, I am pleased to note that volatility in the first half of 2020 did not hinder our progress on most of our key growth initiatives. On June 16, we officially launched our transaction banking service to U.S. clients on-time and below budget despite the unexpected challenges of shifting our global team to work from home and launching the platform remotely. As of quarter end, we have over 175 clients on the platform and $25 billion in deposits, many of which we expect will become operational as clients begin to utilize -- begin their utilization of the platform over time. Second, in alternatives, we accelerated the marketing of a new credit fund called West Street Strategic Solutions as a part of our transition to fund driven investing. Client receptivity has been very strong. We believe the strategy is well-timed to capture opportunities in the market today and provide critical private financing to companies in need. Our approaches highly differentiated, leveraging the broad global sourcing capabilities of Goldman Sachs. Just this week, we have closed over $6 billion of commitments. Ultimately, we expect to raise an excess of $10 billion in the coming months. What is most impressive is that our first close occurred in less than 90 days entirely via virtual meetings. We're broadening our client base to include leading institutions and pension fund investors that have not partnered with Goldman Sachs before. These expanding relationships will be helpful to our efforts as additional strategies when funds are launched. You will recall that this initiative was part of our strategy discussed in Investor Day in January and promises to be significant in our move toward a less capital intensive, more fee driven model for our investing platforms. Third, in wealth management, we continued to integrate our new high net worth business, which we recently rebranded personal financial management. Year-to-date, we've generated over 400 client referrals between personal financial management and our flagship ultra high net worth private wealth business, representing $1.5 billion in assets under supervision opportunity, as we now have a credible offering to serve high net worth clients. That said establishing new health management relationships in the current environment with only virtual communication is challenging, we would expect our progress to accelerate under more normal circumstances. Fourth, we continued to expand our digital consumer business. We were pleased to announce our new small business lending partnership with Amazon, which will allow us to leverage our proprietary digital underwriting decision platform using data shared by Amazon third-party sellers to provide inventory and operational financing to support their growth. This partnership, which is being launched on a smaller scale at this moment is another example of our innovation and our ability to partner with leading corporations to deliver differentiated value to our customers. Our consumer partnership also included a recent point of sale financing engagement with JetBlue, and of course, our credit card with Apple. Before turning to Stephen, I would like to spend a moment on diversity and inclusion which is a critical priority for the firm and a personal focus of mine for many years. Like so many others over the past six weeks, I've spent a lot of time listening and learning about the challenges we face as a nation on racial equity. While Goldman Sachs has long sought to advance diversity and inclusion, we're still not where we need to be. There's both a moral and economic imperative that we make progress. We must be a diverse and inclusive organization to unlock our full potential, as we serve a global marketplace that is diverse in all aspects including race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. Lastly, let me review our business resiliency and return to office strategy, which has begun in our major offices globally. The firm continues to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely, demonstrating the dedication of our people, the strength of our technology and our business resiliency. Our firm has always had a team oriented apprenticeship culture and we benefit from being and working together, so as each of the communities where we operate reopens, we are taking the necessary steps to gradually return to office in a safe manner. We are following the lead of our Asia colleagues. We're in Hong Kong using a split team approach with up to 50% working from the office. We're also making progress in Europe, we're on the continent 35% returned and in the U.K., where approximately 15% of our employees are back in office. Recently in New York, a small group of employees have returned to office. Going forward, our progress will be dictated by circumstances in each region and we will adjust as needed. We are taking many new precautions to ensure safety including through masks and social distancing. And it's certainly not business as usual, but we're making tangible forward progress. As we take these steps, we will continue to keep the health and safety of our people as our top priority. In closing, I would just like to say how proud I am of the people of Goldman Sachs. They have worked tirelessly during this time to engage and serve our clients, leverage technology to insert our resiliency and prudently manage our risk and financial resources. With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page three. During the second quarter, we saw a very strong performance from our investment banking and global market segments, as clients were exceptionally active in raising capital in the equity and debt markets, managing balance sheets, repositioning investment portfolios and hedging risks across asset classes. We also saw a year-over-year revenue growth in our consumer and wealth management segment as we continue to expand our private wealth, high net worth and consumer businesses. Gains across these three segments were partly offset by a decline in our asset management segment, given smaller gains on equity investments versus a year ago. Before turning to segment results, I want to spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. On June 29, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.7%, which implies a common equity Tier-1 requirement of 13.7% for the firm, effective October 1. While higher than anticipated, this requirement is just slightly higher than our reported standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% as of June 30. In fact, our currency CET1 ratio improved by 110 basis points this quarter and is now 30 basis points higher than where we started this year, demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our capital while deploying balance sheet for our clients. Consistent with the Federal Reserve's requirements for all large banks, we will extend the suspension of purchases into the third quarter. But it is our intention to maintain our dividends both common and preferred, while complying with the SCB rule upon implementation. Furthermore, we will continue to pursue our longstanding practice of deploying capital to our business will return to accretive and otherwise returning it to our shareholders as permissible and ever mindful of the environment. As we consider the results of the stress test, it is important to bear in mind that the firm like the industry experienced an actual stress test over the past few months. The global economy contracted sharply and unemployment in the U.S. hit levels higher than contemplated in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. During this period, we maintained robust levels of liquidity and capital. And despite the stress, the firm emerged from the second quarter stronger and continues to serve clients from a position of financial and competitive strength and with the objective of producing attractive returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm on a medium term basis, but we recognize our near term capital requirement is higher in light of the stress test results. We do not control the Federal Reserve's scenarios and models. But the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing the strategy outlined at Investor Day with a focus on diversifying our business mix and reducing the stress capital intensity of our balance sheet. As David highlighted, our execution of this strategy is advancing. We have sold or announced the sale of nearly $4 billion in equity investments year-to-date, including or agreed sell of Global Atlantic just last week, which will have positive implications for capital and balance sheet. We remain committed to capital efficiency as we diversify our business and grow more durable revenues. With that, let's now turn to our business performance on Page four, beginning with Investment Banking. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $2.7 billion up 36% versus a year ago, financial advisory revenues of $686 million remained healthy, but down 11% versus last year, amid fewer transaction closings consistent with the industry. Year-to-date, we participated in nearly $290 billion of announced transactions and closed over 140 deals for $600 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A, league table rankings by a considerable margin. While recent M&A announcements have slowed, our Investment Banking client dialogues remained very active with client interactions up over 30% versus last year, notwithstanding the continuing work from home dynamic. In the second half, we are watching for a potential pickup in M&A activity, both from companies coming from a position of strength, as well as those challenged by the environment. Dislocated asset prices will help drive those opportunities as will the significant amount of private capital available for deployment. That said macro and political uncertainty remain relevant and will influence outcomes. As M&A announcements declined in the quarter, the headline for investment banking was in underwriting. In these turbulent markets, we have seen our underwriting market shares increase as clients have turned to Goldman Sachs, particularly for more complex and innovative financings where execution matters. In equity underwriting, we delivered record quarterly net revenues of $1.1 billion, year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting, as our volumes jumped to over $50 billion across more than 270 deals. We saw strong activity this quarter across IPOs, follow-ons and private issuances. Convertibles also had record activity, where we ranked number one. In debt underwriting net revenues were $990 million up 93% from a year ago, as we help finance record U.S. investment grade volumes and supported a broader reopening of the high yield market. Since the crisis hit, our market shares in investment grade and high yield have increased globally, driving our number four ranking in global debt underwriting. This performance amidst the volatility of the last several months is the product of many years of strategic focus and investment in our client franchise. Given the pace of activity, our investment banking backlog decreased significantly versus the first quarter. This is a function of both the volume of our recent deal execution and slower replenishment. It is also important to point out that the timeline from discussion to execution, notably in financing has shortened in this period, and therefore, backlog may for the moment be an incomplete indicator of forward activity. Revenues from corporate lending were negative $76 million reflecting $200 million of hedge losses. For risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger relationship lending commitments. As credit spreads tightened during the quarter, we reverse much of the $375 million hedge gain we saw last quarter. With respect to relationship lending, we also saw a meaningful reversal of corporate commitment draws in the quarter totaling $9 billion in net pay downs as financing conditions improved and we help clients access the capital markets. The strong issuance market also enabled us to reduce our underwriting commitments in the deals book. For example, we successfully syndicated acquisition financings, including \u20ac10 billion for [indiscernible] and $27 billion for T-Mobile, thereby reducing exposure to the firm. Moving to global markets on Page five, where we experience considerable strength and performance. Net revenues were $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity, continued wider bid ask spreads and strong risk management amid continued market volatility. The business benefited from expanded market share as investment in the client franchise and our continued strategic commitment to a global business model with scale across asset classes bolstered performance. Turning to FICC on Page six. Net revenues were $4.2 billion, growth versus last year was driven by 163% increase in intermediation and 71% increase in financing revenues. In FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows with all five of our businesses increasing versus last year. In credit, our performance benefited from broad based client engagement and strength across investment grade, high yield and distressed as well as bank loans amid wider bid ask margins, tighter credit spreads and high new issue volume. We also saw continued success in systematic and electronic market making including high utilization rates for a bond pricing engine and automated trading, all leading to higher market share for the business. In currencies, we had another very active quarter with solid activity among corporates, banks and hedge fund clients. Revenues improved as higher volatility through a significantly higher client volume in the Americas and Europe. Our rates franchise also performed well on strong trading and high levels of client activity is elevated volatility, normalized amid coordinated global central bank stimulus. In commodities, strong trading performance was aided by high volumes and volatility across all of our businesses, including oil, natural gas and metals. In mortgages, net revenues improved significantly on strength in agency and non-agency trading, partly offset by lower loan trading volumes. Lastly, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength across repo and structured credit. Turning to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.9 billion up 46% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $2.2 billion rose 91% aided by robust performance in cash and derivatives amid elevated client volumes. We saw strength across the board in commissions, market making, electronic trading and ETFs, as we executed for a broad base of active, passive hedge fund and systematic clients. This reflects our multi-year efforts to leverage our scale and expand wallet share. Equity financing revenues of $742 million declined 14% year-over-year, driven by tighter spreads, lower average client balances and weakness in Europe given recent dividend cancellations. Finally, across global markets, we continue to invest in technology platforms to enhance user experience and straight through processing. We also saw continued high levels of client activity on our marquee platform through the second quarter with our highest ever external engagement in April. Moving to Asset Management now on Page seven, in the second quarter, we generated segment revenues of $2.1 billion down 18% versus a year ago. As a reminder, this segment includes our platform that serves clients across a full spectrum of asset classes, from liquidity to alternatives, as well as our own on balance sheet investing activities. As David mentioned, we expect third-party investing in this segment to grow over time as part of our broader strategic initiatives. Management and other fees related to Asset Management clients totaled $684 million up 3% versus a year ago, driven by higher assets under supervision, offset by mix given growth in liquidity products. Equity investments produced $924 million of net gains in the second quarter, aided by asset sales and a significant rebound in the value of public equity positions. More specifically on our $2.6 billion public equity portfolio, we recognize $635 million of gains, including approximately 200 million in gains on Avantor and Sprout and significantly better performance across the broader portfolio. Despite recent gains, we reduced the size of our public portfolio by roughly 35% over the past five years. On our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated event driven gains of approximately $500 million from various positions, including the sale of our U.K. student housing investment and AirTrunk an Australian data center, both of which we announced last quarter. These gains were offset by $415 million of negative marks relating to certain COVID impacted and other investments. This quarter approximate 20% of companies in our private equity portfolio saw their performance impacted by COVID-19. Lastly, we also had positive revenues of $200 million related to our consolidated investment entities in the private equity portfolio. Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $459 million, which include approximately $200 million from net interest income, with the remainder from gains on fair value debt securities and loans, reflecting tighter credit spreads, retracing nearly 25% of the losses taken last quarter. Let me now turn to Page eight, where we provide further transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet. On the left of this slide, we show our equity investment portfolio broken out by sector, geography and vintage. We also provide new detail on our $20 billion portfolio of CIEs. These are primarily comprised of real estate investments of which $11 billion are finance predominantly by non-recourse debt. At the bottom of the slide, we show the diversification of the portfolio with only 7% related to the retail sector and 4% to hospitality. On the right side of the slide, we reflect our $30 billion lending and debt investment portfolio, which includes $17 billion of loans that are predominantly secured and 13 billion of debt investments. We further break down these amounts by accounting classification, sector and geography. This portfolio comprises corporate and real estate loans and corporate debt securities. We will continue to refine this disclosure to be responsive to questions from the investor community. I will now turn to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page nine. In this segment, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the second quarter, up 9% versus a year ago, driven by higher wealth management assets and higher consumer banking revenues. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $938 million rose 13% versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition, assets under supervision rose 14% versus the prior year to $558 billion. Consumer banking revenues were $258 million in the second quarter, rising 19% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from credit card lending. Consumer deposits at quarter end totaled $92 billion across the U.S. and U.K., reflecting $20 billion of growth in the quarter. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at roughly $7 billion, of which approximately $5 billion were from Marcus loans and $2 billion from Apple Card. We continue to prudently risk manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates. Now let's turn to Page 10, for our firm wide assets under supervision. Total client assets increased to $2.1 trillion, approximately $240 billion versus the first quarter and up nearly $400 billion versus a year ago. This marks the first quarter in which we exceeded $2 trillion in assets under supervision. Our sequential improvement was driven by $100 billion of market appreciation $133 billion of liquidity inflows and $6 billion of long-term inflows. On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm wide net interest income was $944 million for the second quarter, down sequentially and versus a year ago, amid lower rates and an increase in our liquidity pool. Importantly, and as I have noted previously, as a firm, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. While our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive, given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets, and hedge floating rate liabilities, if interest rates remain stable, we expect NII to gradually expand over time as our consumer deposits reprice. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $117 billion, down $11 billion sequentially, as we saw significant pay downs on corporate revolvers as I noted earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, up $650 million versus last quarter. Let me break this provision number down for you. On the wholesale portfolio, we took pool reserves of $700 million, as modeled losses under CECL were higher relative to the first quarter, principally as a function of macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, worsening in the second quarter relative to similar inputs during the first quarter. The $700 million included both higher loss expectations and lower recovery rates. We also took impairments on wholesale loans of $540 million primarily related to credits in the industrials, TMT and natural resource sectors. Included in the $540 million of impairments, was $155 million related to Hertz as the company declared bankruptcy. This impairment was the largest in the quarter and was offset by gains on hedges which served as a risk mitigant. With hedged gains reported in the lending sub-segment of investment banking. In our consumer portfolio, provisions of $305 million increased versus last quarter, reflecting $220 million of reserve build an $85 million of net charge offs. During the quarter we recognized firm wide net charge offs of $260 million, resulting in an annualized net charge off ratio of 0.9%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans increased 120 basis points to 3.7% for our $105 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 17%. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $8.4 billion increased versus last year. This includes higher compensation expense in line with revenue growth. Our non-comp expense growth was driven by $120 million increase in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees from higher client activity, $130 million of investments related to technology and new businesses including Apple Card and PFM and $100 million in CIE expense, which should decline as we harvest these investments, and roughly $900 million increase in litigation. Our reported year-to-date efficiency ratio was 67%, which was burdened by over 5 percentage points due to litigation. We continue to make progress on our medium term, expense savings initiatives set forth at Investor Day and expect to realize additional planned reductions in non-compensation expenses through the back half of the year. Finally, our reported tax rate was 22% for the year-to-date, reflecting the impact of higher earnings on permanent tax benefits and non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13, as I mentioned common Tier-1 equity ratio for the firm was 13.6% at the end of the second quarter, under the standardized approach, up 110 basis points sequentially more than recouping the decline seen in the first quarter. The improvement was driven largely by earnings and RWA management. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 10 basis points to 12.4% as higher capital was partially offset by higher RWAs due to a full quarter impact of increased market volatility. On the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion up 5% versus last quarter. We maintain strong liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging a record $290 billion, with growth largely commensurate with balance sheet expansion amid strong deposit growth. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $268 billion, up $48 billion versus last quarter, which should enable us to maintain low levels of wholesale financing activity for the balance of the year has had been our intention. In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise and our ability to provide differentiated [advice] [ph] and market access in a volatile environment. We maintain a prudent risk orientation, mindful of continued uncertainty in the markets and the ongoing health crisis. Our core businesses are performing well and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which set the foundation for our ability to serve our clients through this challenging time. With that, thank you again for dialing in and we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: So my question on trading is, towards the beginning you said at Investor Day we were talking about little more focused on the financing side and felt like clients would pay for that and the intermediation has been more commoditized and volatility was low. So what do you know intermediation hikes because the world goes crazy? So I'm curious of two things on this front is, one is the pickup in intermediation just a function of volatility and that'll subside as the world calms down, has anything changed there in terms of pricing market share and the client's needs for you that's Part A. And Part B is on the financing front, he did show progress it is growing but is there anything in the way the [indiscernible] stress testing goes that would frown upon that or would change your intention on continuing to grow the financing side?\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Glenn. Thanks for the questions. David. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start at a high level on trading activity and I'll have Stephen answer the second point around financing and addressing your question as to potential impact from CCAR. There's no question that when we step back and we think strategically about our franchise, we want to be in a position to serve our clients. We've always had great confidence in the broad global footprint that we bring to global markets, that we're an all products all over the world. And as our clients look to intermediate markets, we have a full service capability to serve them. There's no question that over the last decade, in a period of very low interest rates and low volatility that has been a more commoditized service, as you say, in a period where there's enormous change and enormous volatility in markets, we became super busy because our clients are super busy. And the reason you see this pick up in activity is because there was a lot of activity from our clients. I don't necessarily view that as permanent. But at the same point, it shows you that whether it's in a more low muted environment where we're well positioned to grow our financing business to serve our clients needs, or in a period where our clients be more access to liquidity, our franchise is very well positioned to serve them. And I think we got a benefit in this quarter from that positioning. It's obviously very hard to predict, given the uncertain nature of the environment, how this would continue, I'd say up front, because I know it'll be a question from a number of you that the activity levels that we saw at the end of March and in April, we're really extraordinary. We've not seen the same level of activity over the course of the last five or six weeks, since the beginning of June, but I would say the activity levels over the last five or six weeks when looked at compared to activity levels in 2019, or 2018 still look pretty active. And so we continue to see clients very, very engaged in our markets business. I think Stephen should comment on financing CCAR and how we're thinking about that. So I'll pass to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thanks, David, and thanks, Glenn, for the question. Just to sort of pivot off of David's comments, I would say the important thing to think about in the context of activity is that we were experiencing, as David put it, very elevated volumes at wider bid offer. And Goldman Sachs sort of went through the market and didn't pull back and away from the market. And in doing that, we picked up market share, which I think will have lasting effect, notwithstanding where the market goes in terms of its dynamic. And the other thing I would point out is that in working through those flows, we managed risk really well, meaning we were not with elevated inventory, we saw high velocity turn in our risk in serving the intermediation needs of the clients and I think that's an important point to make. On the financing side of the business overall, it's important to bear in mind financing and FICC was up about 71%. We saw considerable strength both in repo and in structured credit. We saw similar activity on the equity financing side as well. As it relates to SCB and CCAR, I think that the ability of the firm to be agile and take our capital ratio up to 13.6% kind of takes SCB off the table and capital off the table in terms of our ability to present ourselves into the third quarter and beyond is ready and open to play the role we did in the second quarter, which is stand ready to meet the intermediation and trading needs of our clients. And I think the final comment, I'd make just on capital is that, we said during Investor Day that we would be agile, meaning we would be agile with the deployment of capital in and around the businesses of the firm. Now, at the time, the questions that came to us were more about the ability to pull capital from the securities business not put to it, in this quarter, we moved capital to it, returns were extraordinary, super attractive and we were able to move that around, you know, as the kind of flexible organization that we'd like to think of ourselves as and we'll continue to do that based on what the market opportunity shows us.\nGlenn Schorr: Very helpful and thank you for that one. One other question is, you mentioned the sale of Global Atlantic. I think that closes in a few quarters. I think you guys should get a lot of respect for growing that from scratch basically. Just curious how much of that, what percentage you own, Goldman Sachs own, not the private client, Goldman Sachs own sizing of the game, how much RWA that frees up anything you could help on that? Because it is a good business, it's just really dense RWA I guess?\nStephen Scherr: No, I mean, Glenn, I think you characterized it exactly well, and you hit the point, which was our motivation for the sale itself, which is, this was a business that began in 2004. It was spun-off in the second quarter of '13. And over time, because of its intensity as a financial institution, it becomes more capital intensive. So, obviously, our motivation is to free up that capital and deploy it elsewhere around. We were about 25% of the ownership we're selling out, if not all, then, the preponderance of our position on that sale will release about $2.2 billion of risk weighted assets and about $400 million of attributed equity. I'd also point out that this is part and parcel of kind of a larger move that will take place over the course of the entire year, which is this will be part of about $4 billion of sales, off the balance sheet, all part of our broader strategy of looking at lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet, intense investments and moving more towards third-party funds. And so we will by the end of the year, reduce that down by about $4 billion. That will relieve us of about $2 billion of capital and about $13 billion of risk weighted assets, again, Global Atlantic being part of that. I would say roughly speaking, almost half of that is done, with the other half announced and spoken for and expected through the balance of the year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Christian, please go ahead and check your phone to see if it's on mute.\nChristian Bolu: Maybe just following up on the capital question just asked. I guess I think about your CET1, potential for another 50 basis points of GCP surcharge. Maybe you might want in as a management buffer on top of what will be a minimum SCB number, your actual capital requirements could be approaching 15% on the standardized side. So maybe just help us think about how you think about getting that number back down to -- more like 13%, 13.5%, which is a long-term target. And then sort of, what are the strategic or what are the implications for sort of your strategic growth initiatives potentially you have to bring down capital by that much?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. Thanks, Christian. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we remain committed over the medium term to the range of 13% to 13.5%. I think we're executing at the moment in the moment, meaning we're in the midst of a pandemic. Obviously, the results around CCAR and the SCB fixing was higher than what we had expected and perhaps reflects a view about where we are at a moment in the market. But I think our strategy as articulated and Investor Day and frankly speaking what I described in the path toward reducing down capital intensity of our balance sheet investing are all part and parcel of our ability to take down, what is otherwise meant to be represented in the peak to trough in the SCB. And so we're executing now, we are in a position having grown back our capital ratio to be within narrow distance of what's required. But again, that's a moment, I wouldn't fix a permanent capital buffer, nor look to amend what I view is our medium to long-term objective for a profile of the business, which will benefit from key strategic initiatives, which will lower the capital intensity of where we're going. And I think that's the forward path. And so, we'll remain quick on our feet as it relates to this. But I just want to give you a sense of what the forward direction is for the firm itself.\nChristian Bolu: Great, thank you. And then on cost, a very strong core cost control ex-litigation in the quarter, I believe you mentioned, you'd expect more non-comp benefit in the back half. So maybe help quantify that for us? And then, maybe look longer term, you've had a bit of a chance now to get a sense of the post COVID world. So how do you think about sort of structural expense trajectory, particularly in light of that sort of 1.3 billion target, can how much upside could that be in that number? Thank you.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. Sure. So a non-comp expense is, as you suggest ex-litigation, our non-comp expenses are up about 9%. And a good portion of that increase is attributable to variable expense like BC&A. So this is expense, obviously related to the nature and level of activity that we experienced in the business. And the other portion of that increase is largely related to new businesses or larger size businesses than where we were a year ago. So think, the acquisition of United Capital expenses associated with it, or Apple Card. And so expense control has been on the front of our mind. What I expect to play out in the back half of the year, we'll be as we've said previously, the benefits from a reduction in double occupancy expense relating to real estate, two buildings, both in London and in Bangalore that roll off and so as we've long planned and expected, that will benefit us in terms of the reduction in non-comp expense overall. On a more structural plane and thinking back to the $1.3 billion of expense reduction that we articulated, frankly, I think we come at that number now, with greater confidence in the in that number and frankly the ability to exceed it over the medium to long-term. And part of that is informed by judgments that we are making and analysis that we're undergoing, not just simply about the size of the firm, but where the physical location of the firm can be. That is our ability to take aggregation of people or whole businesses and look to move them to different locations either around the world or around the country. And I think the flexibility and the agility that we can take from what we've witnessed in the context of the last several months, only feeds our confidence in the ability to do that and therefore our ability to hit the $1.3 billion target or better over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Wanted to ask just a follow-up on the funding optimization efforts that you guys have talked about before. Certainly the deposit growth continues to surprise positively both on the consumer side as well as within transaction banking. Now given that some of the growth appears to be tracking ahead of plan, or it sounds like you're quite confident on your expense savings targets from Investor Day. I was hoping you can give us an update on the funding side as well whether you're still quite confident in that billion savings goal, recognizing that a lot is going to be dependent on term structure shape of the curve, what have you.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So on deposits, your observation is right. I mean total deposits for the firm now is $268 billion that's up $48 billion quarter-on-quarter. Marcus deposits now, again, through the retail channel are at $92 billion that was up $20 billion in the second quarter. And we're also seeing deposits commence or not yet operational in the transaction banking deposit side. So the growth in the deposit channels overall has been really, really positive. The question of whether we can harvest the precise level of savings of $1 billion that we forecast, rests largely on market sort of developments. What I mean by that is, the deposits in retail currently are from a financial point of view, less valuable in the moment than where they were in the January Investor Day, meaning we've seen Fed funds come down by about 150 basis points but we haven't experienced corresponding beta on the downside in the retail deposit channel. That will come over time as we develop a more sort of substantive and profound level of engagement with retail customers, the reliance on rate will become less so and we'll be able to sort of capture back where we were. But I'd say that much of what we premised our Investor Day presentation on was an assumption about normal markets were not normal markets, the precipitous decline in rates but not a corresponding decline in deposits will lessen some of the savings but I wouldn't sort of put too much of a permanent conclusion to that, let's wait until we get to a more permanent state of a normal market to sort of judge that. By the way, by contrast, we do see positive beta in other channels which play that way, particularly in the high net worth channel. But I think we'll need to sort of assess just the magnitude. By the way, none of that is to take away from the strategic value of this consumer and the overall deposit channel, which is enabling us, frankly, faster than we thought to take out the wholesale funding channel. And just by way of reference, we've got about $10 billion of wholesale debt through the balance of this year, either maturing or subject to call and we'll be able to sort of act on that reducing down the liquidity that we hold all as a consequence of the growth that we've seen in the deposit channel overall.\nSteven Chubak: Great. Thanks for that helpful color Stephen. Maybe this is a question for you, David on the M&A outlook. And one of the concerns we heard from folks is the challenging M&A backdrop could very well persist just given low levels of CEO confidence and just uncertainty around the election and future tax policy. And I was hoping you can give some color as to what you're hearing from the C-suite, regarding appetite for M&A and willingness to do deals and maybe what ingredients needs to be in place to help reinvigorate deal activity here.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks for that question. And of course, you're right at a high level. And we've always said this, the number one thing that drives M&A activity is CEO confidence. And there's no question in this environment given the high level of uncertainty, it's much harder to see those same levels of confidence as a result of that as we highlighted in our opening commentary that M&A volume -- M&A announced M&A transactions in the second quarter were down 75%. And so as you would expect, we saw withdrawal of activity. We obviously saw closings on previous activity. But we did not see replenishment in advisory transactions that we would normally see. And I'd say that in March and April, in particular and into the first half of May, dialogue with CEOs around forward strategic decision-making was very, very limited. People were in crisis mode and we're very focused on dealing with the immediacy of the healthcare crisis and the crisis as it was affecting their businesses. We have seen over the course of the last six weeks or so as economies around the world have started to reopen, or reengagement by clients and CEOs in their forward strategic view. I would say that the dialogue levels right now are particularly robust. I don't believe that we'll see short-term activity but I would expect over the course of the next 2 to 4 quarters, those activity levels will build, as we have a clear understanding as to the overall direction of the healthcare issue that we all face, and the overall economic impact that comes out of this. And as people have more confidence, they'll be able to move forward, you did see one or two significant M&A transactions during the course of the last week. I want to be clear, it's not shut down, but I think you need a more certain environment with better insight into the healthcare situation and the economic situation to see that replenishment normalized. My guess is, we'll get that but it'll take a couple of quarters for sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Carrier: First one, just on the private equity sales this year, I think you mentioned freeing up about 2 billion of capital. And if I'm not mistaken, I think during the Investor Day, you guys mentioned I think it was about 4 billion over a period of three years. So just curious, is this more accelerated has that opportunity set, expanded? Just trying to get an understanding of maybe the pace of that kind of strategic shift?\nStephen Scherr: Yes. So, you have the facts, right. I mean by the end of the year, as I said, will free up about $2 billion, which is 50% of the way toward the objective of four. I would say that, I don't view that four as being in any way, the limit of what we can get done, the more we can advance and increase the cadence on the migration to low our capital density investing, the better will be and we'll continue to pursue that. Obviously, there's two sides to this that are both progressing. I mean, on one hand, we're effectuating sales that will relieve us of capital, but we're doing that not leaving ourselves in kind of a canyon of activity in that as we said during the prepared remarks, we've really advanced on the raise of our first fund inside of 30 days, having a first close in excess of 6 billion with a target of greater than 10. And while we set out the objective of doing about $100 billion of raise in and across a range of different funds, I think we all have an expectation that will exceed the $20 billion target we thought we would get to this year and look to revise targets across all of this as in when we think it appropriate. But, this is good forward progress and we're very determined to see it happen.\nMike Carrier: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up just on the trading activity. David, I think you mentioned just higher activity year-over-year even in the past couple of weeks. Just when you think about it across that products client side, obviously, we have ongoing volatility and uncertainty that kind of benefits the industry. But are you seeing any point it's a structural shifts in terms of Goldman share gains, more use of the electronic platforms, additional client relationships that can maybe be more sustainable once some of this volatility surfaces.\nDavid Solomon: I appreciate the question, Michael. There number of things going on that we've highlighted, but to summarize or maybe put it in a different context of frames to your question. One of the things we've done over the last two years is we've thought very, very carefully about our global markets franchise, the way we wanted to center that franchise, which was really around our clients. And we invested in a one GF approach that we've talked about, that really tries to improve the client experience for our clients across that franchise. And we started making an investment in those relationships, improving wallet gaps, improving shares. That's an investment we started two years ago, that was paying dividends. But I think what you saw, given the increased volatility and the heightened activity on the part of our clients, we saw an acceleration of the benefits of some of that investment during the course of the end of the first quarter and the second quarter. I think the real share gains there. I'm getting a lot of feedback from clients directly, that they really appreciate the way we've invested in the client centricity of that business, the way we've kept a strong investment and really meeting their needs. And I think we've reaped some dividends from that investment. Now, as that continues, we'll work to protect those share gains. But I'd also highlight, I still think there's upside for us when I look across the hundred largest players in that business and I look at our share across the hundred largest players and we're top three with 100 largest players. While we've made progress, I think we still have upside in the medium term if we continue to execute on our strategy to take more wallet share, given the strength and the breadth of our franchise and we're going to continue to remain focused on that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy, please go ahead and check to see if you're on mute.\nBetsy Graseck: So, just a couple of questions. One, I know that earlier, there was a question around capital and how to utilize capital most efficiently. And I wanted to raise it how I'm seeing the VAR trajectory over this past quarter. And I'm wondering, is there an opportunity here given the capital generation that you've been unable to do and also the RWA, compression that we lean into the VAR and keep VAR relatively high. I know in the quarter it was up significantly q-on-q. But how much of that is market related? And how much do you anticipate running it maybe a higher VAR than you have had in the past given, your capital flexibility that you have.\nStephen Scherr: So, I think the premise of your question Betsy sort of strikes at the answer, which is, we do have capital flexibility to elevate our VAR using VAR as a basis or as a metric if you will, for extending into client needs. So, both responding to the need for intermediation and positions deploying capital against it, and equally being responsive to the possibility of the market inflating, such that VAR increases in the context of inflated notional positions with particular credits. And so I think we feel very comfortable and part of the reason to take up our capital to sort of adequate levels relative to where we will be required to be, I mean, gives us greater confidence to see VAR inflate to the extent that we are in a position to serve our clients in periods of continued uncertainty as David's been speaking about in the markets more broadly.\nBetsy Graseck: Was there anything this quarter in particular, that's [row] [ph] VAR, I guess last quarter was A1 average VAR and this quarter was 122 and I know that total one, but it was up across the board in the various categories. May speak to what you saw in this quarter that drove that VAR up and what you think could be sustained into the second half of the year and what that means for trading revenues. Jamie [indiscernible] I should cut in half your trading revenues, for 3Q but where do you stand on that kind of question?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I don't think any of us are in a position to make such a declarative judgment about the exact direction of trading revenues in through the second half of the year. I think that, what we need to do is set ourselves up to be in the service of clients and avail ourselves of the benefit of our shareholders of the opportunities as they present. And I think David characterized it well, which is, the second half will be more characterized by uncertainty than any ability to forecast up or down in the market itself. And I think we're well positioned from a liquidity from a capital and from a risk point of view to be able to avail ourselves. The one thing I would say, as we think about risk in markets like this is drawing the distinction between, what's liquid and what's not. So when I look at the firm, I think that inventory was managed in the pursuit of intermediation in the trading business exceptionally well. We saw very high velocity as we've long been looking to work with our securities leadership to do, in terms of seeing quicker turnover in inventory in support of trading activity. When I look at illiquid, this is an area where from a risk point of view, we use market opportunities to lower for example, commitments made in the deals book and took that book down and took risk down and position ourselves now to take on more risk in through the second half of the year, to the extent that those opportunities present themselves. And so, I feel quite good and confident about where we stand from a risk position, not limited to what we do in trading activity, which will present itself but equally around other areas of the firm, with more structural and kind of less liquid risks to take on board.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Well, my short question is as, look, you're the number one advisor. So what are you advising clients to do? And how are you allocating the firm's resources to back that up? And the color behind that is, it seems like the elephant in the room is, look COVID cases are going up. I think death rates followed by about four weeks per -- expert that we had on a call and then you have shutdowns, you're seeing the shutdowns like in California and elsewhere. So there's two scenarios here. One is maybe Goldman is needed less that investors and your clients go home and sit on the sidelines, too much risk, or maybe Goldman Sachs needed more, as you said, more complex deals, wider bid offer spreads, elevated volumes, more of a freak out market where you guys stay open for business. So what are you advising clients? How are you reallocating your resources for that and what are your thoughts on my question?\nDavid Solomon: Well, it's a very uncertain environment, Mike. It's a very uncertain environment. And so one of the things we're advising clients is that it's a very uncertain environment and they have to bring caution and planning to everything they do. I watch TV and read the news like everyone else and sometimes quite surprised by how certain people are. I continue to be relatively uncertain as to the trajectory of all this. As I've said before, we need to understand the healthcare risks associated with the virus and get to a point where people feel safe and comfortable. Obviously, a vaccine would be a meaningful step forward with respect to that. While there is no question that there's progress with respect to a whole bunch of companies that are making significant investments in a vaccine. And there was positive news again this morning, the exact trajectory of that and how we deploy it and whether the work and the effectiveness of all that is still unclear and uncertain. I'm confident we will get through this but the timing and the impact is relatively uncertain. We've also because of the shutdowns economically all around the world have slowed economic activity. There's no question as reopening occurred, we've seen a pickup in that activity. But with an increase in viruses and this uncertainty persisting, I think you'll see a flattening on that economic pickup and that will slow the progress we make economically from here. So we continue to advise clients to be thoughtful and cautious about that, With respect to Goldman Sachs being open and ready and willing to serve our clients, there's no question in the second quarter that our clients were extremely active and we were there to support them. It's unclear how active we'll be in the third quarter, but there will be activity, we'll be open and at the end of the third quarter, we can kind of look back and say how that unfolded. But I think we've proven and will continue to prove with great humility, that we can be flexible, we can work remotely, we can adapt. And we can also help clients adapt. And so this is a very challenging time for everyone. The human toll of this crisis is really very significant. Everyone is focused on their employees, everyone's focused on their businesses and their stakeholders and the shareholders. And I think that people need to be cautious, because the economic repercussions of this will play out over the medium term. And this is not going to be in my opinion, a quick resolution. And we'll continue to try to be nimble and flexible and help our clients navigate what I think will continue to be a very uncertain period.\nMike Mayo: As a follow up, just as it relates to capital markets, we're all trying to fill in our models for the next several quarters. What could be the next step in capital markets, in terms of repositioning of portfolios due to the election and another government stimulus or [indiscernible] continuing or you mentioned mergers, or you said volumes are still above the level last year even if coming down. People tend to give you a [PE of one] [ph] on your earnings, like a quarter such as this, whereas you talk about the annuity with your clients. So I'm just trying to figure out kind of what's the next step with capital markets at Goldman Sachs?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think our capital markets, businesses have long been a leader. And we've been positioned as a very, very strong leader in M&A advisory activity and equity underwriting activity for decades we've made a significant investment over the last decade in our debt capital markets business. And I think over the last few years, you've seen the benefits of that investment. And I think we're very well positioned to help our clients meet their capital markets needs. Capital Markets is a volatile business yet through the cycle our capital markets, businesses produce significant activity and significant profitability. I don't have a crystal ball as to what's going to happen in the next six months. I've had some time discussions with people where people talk about some capital markets activity being pulled forward. And there's no question that some refinancing has been pulled forward. At the same point, there's been a whole bunch of activity that we could have never imagined would have occurred because of the virus and the economic consequences of the shutdown. So when you look at industries like airlines and cruise and travel and leisure, there's been an enormous amount of capital at markets activity that was completely unanticipated. And so as we look forward over the next six months, I think there'll be other things based on the macro environment that will either lead to a pickup in some places or a decrease. The one thing I know for sure is our franchise on a global basis is very well positioned to meet our clients' needs as that activity occurs.\nStephen Scherr: Mike, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that and this goes back to the initial question you asked which is what are we doing with our clients? I mean, you can look in the capital markets at, the need to apply more creativity to structured solutions for clients than perhaps what we've seen in kind of straightway issuance in more normalized markets. Look at the deal that was completed for United Airlines, which I think brings some interesting ingenuity and structure to what otherwise in the normal course, would have been a fairly straightway financing. And I think that's the nature and level of engagement with the clients that we're experiencing. And I think, it responds a bit to the question of where the capital markets going. There may be more of a need of that right in the uncertainty that David's been addressing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: This quarter, you guys made a purchase of Folio an RIA platform and just kind of curious if you can maybe give a little color on that, was that purely used by United Capital, or is there interest in providing third-party custody services in the RIA space, which is a market where we're seeing some consolidation and there's a lot there -- if they are going from three to two strong providers of pure custody. So just curious if that's part of the plan there?\nStephen Scherr: Yes. I think the way to think about it is that, in the end we're looking to continue to build out kind of three components of that business, there's obviously our ultra high net worth business, there's a high net worth business PFM, which was the United Capital, I think Folio serves to clearly provide added heft to that component of what we're trying to build. The third leg in that stool would obviously be a more mass affluent consumer piece. But the acquisition of Folio was clearly aligned with the strategy begun under United Capital and the provision of third-party custody more broadly. So I think it fits both a generalized strategy, but equally it is entirely consistent with what we were trying to build out in the high net worth or PFM space, which was the United Capital asset itself.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thank you for that Steve. And then, when we were thinking about your comments on the M&A market, interesting and very helpful about the pickup and dialogue in the last six weeks and clearly there's a lot of uncertainty, as you flagged with healthcare and the economic trajectory, but we also hear about the election uncertainty holding back some component of activity in the U.S. Are you seeing a difference or a significant divergence in the level of dialogue in the United States versus other geographies? And is it the other geographies that's leading to the greater engagement or are you seeing it pick up in the U.S. as well just a nuance on that?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Bren. And what I would say is I don't see a difference in engagement levels in the U.S. versus let's say the rest of the world. Engagement levels were way down, engagement levels are picking up everywhere. While the election is certainly something that I think will get a lot of attention over the next five months. It's still five months away and I think that the healthcare crisis and the economic crisis as a result of the healthcare crisis is at a much bigger impact on engagement levels than the election, as to how the election starts to impact decision-making. I can see it in some ways being an accelerant and in some ways, potentially creating uncertainty and slowing things down. But I don't think the election cycle is yet playing a big role in client engagement.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: So, just want to drill a little bit more into the progress in transaction banking. And really just trying to think about do the scaling in that business, 175 clients today and making some progress on deposits. I guess, where do you feel like you are in terms of market share with those clients? So are they kind of test driving the platform today, but they're still kind of a huge opportunity of maybe more penetration? And then, as you think about kind of scaling that platform, kind of what are they using today, why are they using Goldman Sachs and what's the opportunity to do more with him?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I appreciate the question. And I know there's been a lot of interest in this. There's also been a lot of questions about our ability to execute on this. If you go back strategically, one of the reasons that we were very confident of building this platform is we were a big customer of other institutions. And we saw a need based through our own experience. And we've really put together what we think is a very, very friction free digital platform that advances the connectivity that clients have to their financial institution and ease of use in very, very meaningful ways. The rollout has gone very, very well. I think we've been very cautious and conservative, as we talked about it, particularly at Investor Day around client take up. I think one of the reasons we felt comfortable that we could build a platform and attract clients to it, if we build a good platform, is that we have relationships with all these clients whose relationships are real. They rely on us we lend to these clients. And if we had an offering that was competitive, we felt that was a reasonable ask of our clients to consider our offering. I think what you've seen in this initial rollout is a lot of clients have considered our offering and the first and easiest way to consider it is to leave deposits with us to onboard, get an account, see the ease of use and doing that and leave deposits with us. And so, I think that's accelerated at a much faster pace than we expected. We have had a handful of significant clients turn operational, which is obviously where the business becomes much more attractive to us. And I would expect over the course of the medium term, we will grow a very substantial business where these clients become operational on our platform. And that will lead to significant fee-based revenue streams that will help that business grow. But we're in the very early stages, our market share is tiny, we don't have enormous market share aspirations, but we will grow this business we believe nicely over the medium term and it will make a meaningful -- it will make a reasonable contribution to the overall diversification of Goldman Sachs.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. Appreciate that. And then just a follow up question just around the comp ratio, so year-to-date, accruals 35% versus 36% last year in the first half. So I'm trying to just kind of parse through how much of that is actually some of those expense savings coming through versus maybe leverage on mix or the fact that revenues are up 20%, or trying to think about the accrual and how you guys are thinking about that relative to where you were last year.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So the way we think about it is that each and every quarter, we've taken accrual as at that quarter as to what we forecast, we need to pay the organization and compensate the organization on a pay for performance basis. And it's not more than that there's no signaling that's embedded in it or otherwise. I think a good deal of the savings is not anticipated in the context of lowering our comp ratio. It's really looking at the balance of expenses that I was addressing to an earlier question in terms of what we can do to bring down some of the non-comp expense and overall bring our operating expenses down. But fixing this at 35%, as you may remember, we were at 33.8% last year, and so this is an ongoing quarter-by-quarter assessment of what we need to do taking a look at the overall performance of the business itself.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe just a question on the SCB and DFAST, just trying to, if we look at trading, as you pointed out and I agree, you've seen almost a counter cyclicality in trading revenues holding up very well in this kind of stress test we just had from COVID. Yet count, losses in trading through DFAST are still pretty high. So when we think about your SCB going forward, do you think there is any opportunities that have sort of the Fed sort of recalculating how they think about trading losses, which could be a benefit to you or is, simply the view to get the SCB sort of down is to just continue to do what you're doing over time and remix assets. Just trying to see if you think there's a potential for a little benefit from the performance over the last six months?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So I would say that for us pursuing both passive petition and action is right meaning there's a do it yourself proposition here, which is to drive what we've been talking about that is lower capital intensity, balance sheet investing, third-party funds and the like. All of that is subject to self help. And we are minded to aggressively address that, so as to bring the intensity down. As a related matter, I think as you would imagine, we have been very active in our engagement and discussions with the Fed about the very observation you're making, which is when we look back historically, at our own performance, volatility carries a positive correlation for trading revenue and it's not uncorrelated and we have a view about what that means in the context of what the downdraft would be and have been engaged in a very active dialogue with the Fed on that topic. How to handicap the outcome of that is an impossibility and so it is why not withstanding that petition we continue to engage in self-help and look to remedy this on our own terms.\nJim Mitchell: Well, it's good to hear you're [least] [ph] asking. And just maybe one quick follow-up on the advanced CET1. Given the SCB is based on standardized, I mean is there any constraints, does it matter the advanced CET1, I hate to say it that way, but does it?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I think the rating agencies appropriately take a look at the advanced and remember, this has the CVA component in it that's not represented in standardized. And so you've got to be mindful in managing all of these capital ratios that there's not one but many constituencies to bear in mind. And so we do that and obviously pay attention to all of these ratios in the context of how we carry ourselves.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KVW. Please go ahead.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: Just one real quick one on credit, is there anyway you guys give an update on kind of where you're at with regards to the frozen delinquencies? And then, also how you're thinking about reserve builds from here and I mean you build reserve a decent amount this quarter, is this the peak, or I guess, sufficiently reserved for go forward losses? Thanks.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So why don't I start on deferrals or forbearance, so, it's quite light across our whole portfolio, there's only about 3% of our total credit that is itself subject to forbearance. It's higher in the consumer portfolio, it's been about 10% of the total portfolio that has taken up forbearance, interestingly of those that do about 50% are current on their payments. But bear in mind, that's a very small component of the overall risk profile of the firm at $7 billion total. So overall, across the whole of it, it's about 3%. It's not significant in the context of how we operate and how we think about the risk overall, given how low it is. I would say as it relates to the consumer, it is one reason why the coverage ratio that we have through our reserve on a consumer portfolio is as high as it is at 17%. That's not at all a reflection of our current experience in terms of losses. Losses actually are trending lower, notwithstanding the moment in the market, but out of prudence and caution and given how young that portfolio is and given the fact that forbearance can match risk. We've taken up our provision there. More generally on your question about provisioning, as you know, we've took a provision of $1.6 billion in the quarter, the methodology we use is the same, we did in the first and we'll hold ourselves going forward, which is we look at macro economic indicators, including unemployment, that sort of correlate well to expectations around default rates, and then pull that through to avail ourselves of pool reserves. And we broke that down in the prepared remarks, which amounted to about $700 million of the 1.6 that's there, with the balance being impairments and the consumer component of provisions that I spoke about. It leaves us with a coverage ratio of about 3.7%, which I think is roughly in line with where the market is and accurately reflecting risk that's there. So what happens in the forward, it'll purely be a function of what plays out in the market and whether certain of these macro economic indicators worsen or improve from here and that obviously, will flow through our model and dictate the level of provisioning, we take.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nDavid Solomon: Okay. Since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If there any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Heather and her team. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does include the Goldman Sachs' second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Glenn. Thanks for the questions. David. Thanks for the question. I'm going to start at a high level on trading activity and I'll have Stephen answer the second point around financing and addressing your question as to potential impact from CCAR. There's no question that when we step back and we think strategically about our franchise, we want to be in a position to serve our clients. We've always had great confidence in the broad global footprint that we bring to global markets, that we're an all products all over the world. And as our clients look to intermediate markets, we have a full service capability to serve them. There's no question that over the last decade, in a period of very low interest rates and low volatility that has been a more commoditized service, as you say, in a period where there's enormous change and enormous volatility in markets, we became super busy because our clients are super busy. And the reason you see this pick up in activity is because there was a lot of activity from our clients. I don't necessarily view that as permanent. But at the same point, it shows you that whether it's in a more low muted environment where we're well positioned to grow our financing business to serve our clients needs, or in a period where our clients be more access to liquidity, our franchise is very well positioned to serve them. And I think we got a benefit in this quarter from that positioning. It's obviously very hard to predict, given the uncertain nature of the environment, how this would continue, I'd say up front, because I know it'll be a question from a number of you that the activity levels that we saw at the end of March and in April, we're really extraordinary. We've not seen the same level of activity over the course of the last five or six weeks, since the beginning of June, but I would say the activity levels over the last five or six weeks when looked at compared to activity levels in 2019, or 2018 still look pretty active. And so we continue to see clients very, very engaged in our markets business. I think Stephen should comment on financing CCAR and how we're thinking about that. So I'll pass to Stephen. Thanks for that question. And of course, you're right at a high level. And we've always said this, the number one thing that drives M&A activity is CEO confidence. And there's no question in this environment given the high level of uncertainty, it's much harder to see those same levels of confidence as a result of that as we highlighted in our opening commentary that M&A volume -- M&A announced M&A transactions in the second quarter were down 75%. And so as you would expect, we saw withdrawal of activity. We obviously saw closings on previous activity. But we did not see replenishment in advisory transactions that we would normally see. And I'd say that in March and April, in particular and into the first half of May, dialogue with CEOs around forward strategic decision-making was very, very limited. People were in crisis mode and we're very focused on dealing with the immediacy of the healthcare crisis and the crisis as it was affecting their businesses. We have seen over the course of the last six weeks or so as economies around the world have started to reopen, or reengagement by clients and CEOs in their forward strategic view. I would say that the dialogue levels right now are particularly robust. I don't believe that we'll see short-term activity but I would expect over the course of the next 2 to 4 quarters, those activity levels will build, as we have a clear understanding as to the overall direction of the healthcare issue that we all face, and the overall economic impact that comes out of this. And as people have more confidence, they'll be able to move forward, you did see one or two significant M&A transactions during the course of the last week. I want to be clear, it's not shut down, but I think you need a more certain environment with better insight into the healthcare situation and the economic situation to see that replenishment normalized. My guess is, we'll get that but it'll take a couple of quarters for sure. I appreciate the question, Michael. There number of things going on that we've highlighted, but to summarize or maybe put it in a different context of frames to your question. One of the things we've done over the last two years is we've thought very, very carefully about our global markets franchise, the way we wanted to center that franchise, which was really around our clients. And we invested in a one GF approach that we've talked about, that really tries to improve the client experience for our clients across that franchise. And we started making an investment in those relationships, improving wallet gaps, improving shares. That's an investment we started two years ago, that was paying dividends. But I think what you saw, given the increased volatility and the heightened activity on the part of our clients, we saw an acceleration of the benefits of some of that investment during the course of the end of the first quarter and the second quarter. I think the real share gains there. I'm getting a lot of feedback from clients directly, that they really appreciate the way we've invested in the client centricity of that business, the way we've kept a strong investment and really meeting their needs. And I think we've reaped some dividends from that investment. Now, as that continues, we'll work to protect those share gains. But I'd also highlight, I still think there's upside for us when I look across the hundred largest players in that business and I look at our share across the hundred largest players and we're top three with 100 largest players. While we've made progress, I think we still have upside in the medium term if we continue to execute on our strategy to take more wallet share, given the strength and the breadth of our franchise and we're going to continue to remain focused on that. Well, it's a very uncertain environment, Mike. It's a very uncertain environment. And so one of the things we're advising clients is that it's a very uncertain environment and they have to bring caution and planning to everything they do. I watch TV and read the news like everyone else and sometimes quite surprised by how certain people are. I continue to be relatively uncertain as to the trajectory of all this. As I've said before, we need to understand the healthcare risks associated with the virus and get to a point where people feel safe and comfortable. Obviously, a vaccine would be a meaningful step forward with respect to that. While there is no question that there's progress with respect to a whole bunch of companies that are making significant investments in a vaccine. And there was positive news again this morning, the exact trajectory of that and how we deploy it and whether the work and the effectiveness of all that is still unclear and uncertain. I'm confident we will get through this but the timing and the impact is relatively uncertain. We've also because of the shutdowns economically all around the world have slowed economic activity. There's no question as reopening occurred, we've seen a pickup in that activity. But with an increase in viruses and this uncertainty persisting, I think you'll see a flattening on that economic pickup and that will slow the progress we make economically from here. So we continue to advise clients to be thoughtful and cautious about that, With respect to Goldman Sachs being open and ready and willing to serve our clients, there's no question in the second quarter that our clients were extremely active and we were there to support them. It's unclear how active we'll be in the third quarter, but there will be activity, we'll be open and at the end of the third quarter, we can kind of look back and say how that unfolded. But I think we've proven and will continue to prove with great humility, that we can be flexible, we can work remotely, we can adapt. And we can also help clients adapt. And so this is a very challenging time for everyone. The human toll of this crisis is really very significant. Everyone is focused on their employees, everyone's focused on their businesses and their stakeholders and the shareholders. And I think that people need to be cautious, because the economic repercussions of this will play out over the medium term. And this is not going to be in my opinion, a quick resolution. And we'll continue to try to be nimble and flexible and help our clients navigate what I think will continue to be a very uncertain period. Well, I think our capital markets, businesses have long been a leader. And we've been positioned as a very, very strong leader in M&A advisory activity and equity underwriting activity for decades we've made a significant investment over the last decade in our debt capital markets business.

At the same point, there's been a whole bunch of activity that we could have never imagined would have occurred because of the virus and the economic consequences of the shutdown. So when you look at industries like airlines and cruise and travel and leisure, there's been an enormous amount of capital at markets activity that was completely unanticipated. And so as we look forward over the next six months, I think there'll be other things based on the macro environment that will either lead to a pickup in some places or a decrease. The one thing I know for sure is our franchise on a global basis is very well positioned to meet our clients' needs as that activity occurs. Sure, Bren. And what I would say is I don't see a difference in engagement levels in the U.S. versus let's say the rest of the world. Engagement levels were way down, engagement levels are picking up everywhere. While the election is certainly something that I think will get a lot of attention over the next five months. It's still five months away and I think that the healthcare crisis and the economic crisis as a result of the healthcare crisis is at a much bigger impact on engagement levels than the election, as to how the election starts to impact decision-making. I can see it in some ways being an accelerant and in some ways, potentially creating uncertainty and slowing things down. But I don't think the election cycle is yet playing a big role in client engagement. Sure. I appreciate the question. And I know there's been a lot of interest in this. There's also been a lot of questions about our ability to execute on this. If you go back strategically, one of the reasons that we were very confident of building this platform is we were a big customer of other institutions. And we saw a need based through our own experience. And we've really put together what we think is a very, very friction free digital platform that advances the connectivity that clients have to their financial institution and ease of use in very, very meaningful ways. The rollout has gone very, very well. I think we've been very cautious and conservative, as we talked about it, particularly at Investor Day around client take up. I think one of the reasons we felt comfortable that we could build a platform and attract clients to it, if we build a good platform, is that we have relationships with all these clients whose relationships are real. They rely on us we lend to these clients. And if we had an offering that was competitive, we felt that was a reasonable ask of our clients to consider our offering. I think what you've seen in this initial rollout is a lot of clients have considered our offering and the first and easiest way to consider it is to leave deposits with us to onboard, get an account, see the ease of use and doing that and leave deposits with us. And so, I think that's accelerated at a much faster pace than we expected. We have had a handful of significant clients turn operational, which is obviously where the business becomes much more attractive to us. And I would expect over the course of the medium term, we will grow a very substantial business where these clients become operational on our platform. And that will lead to significant fee-based revenue streams that will help that business grow. But we're in the very early stages, our market share is tiny, we don't have enormous market share aspirations, but we will grow this business we believe nicely over the medium term and it will make a meaningful -- it will make a reasonable contribution to the overall diversification of Goldman Sachs. Okay. Since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If there any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Heather and her team. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October. Thank you."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page three. During the second quarter, we saw a very strong performance from our investment banking and global market segments, as clients were exceptionally active in raising capital in the equity and debt markets, managing balance sheets, repositioning investment portfolios and hedging risks across asset classes. We also saw a year-over-year revenue growth in our consumer and wealth management segment as we continue to expand our private wealth, high net worth and consumer businesses. Gains across these three segments were partly offset by a decline in our asset management segment, given smaller gains on equity investments versus a year ago. Before turning to segment results, I want to spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. On June 29, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.7%, which implies a common equity Tier-1 requirement of 13.7% for the firm, effective October 1. While higher than anticipated, this requirement is just slightly higher than our reported standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% as of June 30. In fact, our currency CET1 ratio improved by 110 basis points this quarter and is now 30 basis points higher than where we started this year, demonstrating our ability to effectively manage our capital while deploying balance sheet for our clients. Consistent with the Federal Reserve's requirements for all large banks, we will extend the suspension of purchases into the third quarter. But it is our intention to maintain our dividends both common and preferred, while complying with the SCB rule upon implementation. Furthermore, we will continue to pursue our longstanding practice of deploying capital to our business will return to accretive and otherwise returning it to our shareholders as permissible and ever mindful of the environment. As we consider the results of the stress test, it is important to bear in mind that the firm like the industry experienced an actual stress test over the past few months. The global economy contracted sharply and unemployment in the U.S. hit levels higher than contemplated in the Federal Reserve's severely adverse scenario. During this period, we maintained robust levels of liquidity and capital. And despite the stress, the firm emerged from the second quarter stronger and continues to serve clients from a position of financial and competitive strength and with the objective of producing attractive returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% standardized CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm on a medium term basis, but we recognize our near term capital requirement is higher in light of the stress test results. We do not control the Federal Reserve's scenarios and models. But the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing the strategy outlined at Investor Day with a focus on diversifying our business mix and reducing the stress capital intensity of our balance sheet. As David highlighted, our execution of this strategy is advancing. We have sold or announced the sale of nearly $4 billion in equity investments year-to-date, including or agreed sell of Global Atlantic just last week, which will have positive implications for capital and balance sheet. We remain committed to capital efficiency as we diversify our business and grow more durable revenues. With that, let's now turn to our business performance on Page four, beginning with Investment Banking. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $2.7 billion up 36% versus a year ago, financial advisory revenues of $686 million remained healthy, but down 11% versus last year, amid fewer transaction closings consistent with the industry. Year-to-date, we participated in nearly $290 billion of announced transactions and closed over 140 deals for $600 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A, league table rankings by a considerable margin. While recent M&A announcements have slowed, our Investment Banking client dialogues remained very active with client interactions up over 30% versus last year, notwithstanding the continuing work from home dynamic. In the second half, we are watching for a potential pickup in M&A activity, both from companies coming from a position of strength, as well as those challenged by the environment. Dislocated asset prices will help drive those opportunities as will the significant amount of private capital available for deployment. That said macro and political uncertainty remain relevant and will influence outcomes. As M&A announcements declined in the quarter, the headline for investment banking was in underwriting. In these turbulent markets, we have seen our underwriting market shares increase as clients have turned to Goldman Sachs, particularly for more complex and innovative financings where execution matters. In equity underwriting, we delivered record quarterly net revenues of $1.1 billion, year-to-date, we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting, as our volumes jumped to over $50 billion across more than 270 deals. We saw strong activity this quarter across IPOs, follow-ons and private issuances. Convertibles also had record activity, where we ranked number one. In debt underwriting net revenues were $990 million up 93% from a year ago, as we help finance record U.S. investment grade volumes and supported a broader reopening of the high yield market. Since the crisis hit, our market shares in investment grade and high yield have increased globally, driving our number four ranking in global debt underwriting. This performance amidst the volatility of the last several months is the product of many years of strategic focus and investment in our client franchise. Given the pace of activity, our investment banking backlog decreased significantly versus the first quarter. This is a function of both the volume of our recent deal execution and slower replenishment. It is also important to point out that the timeline from discussion to execution, notably in financing has shortened in this period, and therefore, backlog may for the moment be an incomplete indicator of forward activity. Revenues from corporate lending were negative $76 million reflecting $200 million of hedge losses. For risk management purposes we maintain single name hedges on certain larger relationship lending commitments. As credit spreads tightened during the quarter, we reverse much of the $375 million hedge gain we saw last quarter. With respect to relationship lending, we also saw a meaningful reversal of corporate commitment draws in the quarter totaling $9 billion in net pay downs as financing conditions improved and we help clients access the capital markets. The strong issuance market also enabled us to reduce our underwriting commitments in the deals book. For example, we successfully syndicated acquisition financings, including \u20ac10 billion for [indiscernible] and $27 billion for T-Mobile, thereby reducing exposure to the firm. Moving to global markets on Page five, where we experience considerable strength and performance. Net revenues were $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity, continued wider bid ask spreads and strong risk management amid continued market volatility. The business benefited from expanded market share as investment in the client franchise and our continued strategic commitment to a global business model with scale across asset classes bolstered performance. Turning to FICC on Page six. Net revenues were $4.2 billion, growth versus last year was driven by 163% increase in intermediation and 71% increase in financing revenues. In FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows with all five of our businesses increasing versus last year. In credit, our performance benefited from broad based client engagement and strength across investment grade, high yield and distressed as well as bank loans amid wider bid ask margins, tighter credit spreads and high new issue volume. We also saw continued success in systematic and electronic market making including high utilization rates for a bond pricing engine and automated trading, all leading to higher market share for the business. In currencies, we had another very active quarter with solid activity among corporates, banks and hedge fund clients. Revenues improved as higher volatility through a significantly higher client volume in the Americas and Europe. Our rates franchise also performed well on strong trading and high levels of client activity is elevated volatility, normalized amid coordinated global central bank stimulus. In commodities, strong trading performance was aided by high volumes and volatility across all of our businesses, including oil, natural gas and metals. In mortgages, net revenues improved significantly on strength in agency and non-agency trading, partly offset by lower loan trading volumes. Lastly, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength across repo and structured credit. Turning to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.9 billion up 46% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $2.2 billion rose 91% aided by robust performance in cash and derivatives amid elevated client volumes. We saw strength across the board in commissions, market making, electronic trading and ETFs, as we executed for a broad base of active, passive hedge fund and systematic clients. This reflects our multi-year efforts to leverage our scale and expand wallet share. Equity financing revenues of $742 million declined 14% year-over-year, driven by tighter spreads, lower average client balances and weakness in Europe given recent dividend cancellations. Finally, across global markets, we continue to invest in technology platforms to enhance user experience and straight through processing. We also saw continued high levels of client activity on our marquee platform through the second quarter with our highest ever external engagement in April. Moving to Asset Management now on Page seven, in the second quarter, we generated segment revenues of $2.1 billion down 18% versus a year ago. As a reminder, this segment includes our platform that serves clients across a full spectrum of asset classes, from liquidity to alternatives, as well as our own on balance sheet investing activities. As David mentioned, we expect third-party investing in this segment to grow over time as part of our broader strategic initiatives. Management and other fees related to Asset Management clients totaled $684 million up 3% versus a year ago, driven by higher assets under supervision, offset by mix given growth in liquidity products. Equity investments produced $924 million of net gains in the second quarter, aided by asset sales and a significant rebound in the value of public equity positions. More specifically on our $2.6 billion public equity portfolio, we recognize $635 million of gains, including approximately 200 million in gains on Avantor and Sprout and significantly better performance across the broader portfolio. Despite recent gains, we reduced the size of our public portfolio by roughly 35% over the past five years. On our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated event driven gains of approximately $500 million from various positions, including the sale of our U.K. student housing investment and AirTrunk an Australian data center, both of which we announced last quarter. These gains were offset by $415 million of negative marks relating to certain COVID impacted and other investments. This quarter approximate 20% of companies in our private equity portfolio saw their performance impacted by COVID-19. Lastly, we also had positive revenues of $200 million related to our consolidated investment entities in the private equity portfolio. Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $459 million, which include approximately $200 million from net interest income, with the remainder from gains on fair value debt securities and loans, reflecting tighter credit spreads, retracing nearly 25% of the losses taken last quarter. Let me now turn to Page eight, where we provide further transparency on the composition and diversification of our asset management balance sheet. On the left of this slide, we show our equity investment portfolio broken out by sector, geography and vintage. We also provide new detail on our $20 billion portfolio of CIEs. These are primarily comprised of real estate investments of which $11 billion are finance predominantly by non-recourse debt. At the bottom of the slide, we show the diversification of the portfolio with only 7% related to the retail sector and 4% to hospitality. On the right side of the slide, we reflect our $30 billion lending and debt investment portfolio, which includes $17 billion of loans that are predominantly secured and 13 billion of debt investments. We further break down these amounts by accounting classification, sector and geography. This portfolio comprises corporate and real estate loans and corporate debt securities. We will continue to refine this disclosure to be responsive to questions from the investor community. I will now turn to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page nine. In this segment, we produced $1.4 billion of revenues in the second quarter, up 9% versus a year ago, driven by higher wealth management assets and higher consumer banking revenues. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $938 million rose 13% versus last year, reflecting organic growth in the United Capital acquisition, assets under supervision rose 14% versus the prior year to $558 billion. Consumer banking revenues were $258 million in the second quarter, rising 19% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from credit card lending. Consumer deposits at quarter end totaled $92 billion across the U.S. and U.K., reflecting $20 billion of growth in the quarter. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at roughly $7 billion, of which approximately $5 billion were from Marcus loans and $2 billion from Apple Card. We continue to prudently risk manage these portfolios and have moderated growth relative to initial budget estimates. Now let's turn to Page 10, for our firm wide assets under supervision. Total client assets increased to $2.1 trillion, approximately $240 billion versus the first quarter and up nearly $400 billion versus a year ago. This marks the first quarter in which we exceeded $2 trillion in assets under supervision. Our sequential improvement was driven by $100 billion of market appreciation $133 billion of liquidity inflows and $6 billion of long-term inflows. On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm wide net interest income was $944 million for the second quarter, down sequentially and versus a year ago, amid lower rates and an increase in our liquidity pool. Importantly, and as I have noted previously, as a firm, our overall results are less sensitive to lower interest rates than many traditional banks. While our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive, given our mix of high turnover or floating rate assets, and hedge floating rate liabilities, if interest rates remain stable, we expect NII to gradually expand over time as our consumer deposits reprice. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $117 billion, down $11 billion sequentially, as we saw significant pay downs on corporate revolvers as I noted earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $1.6 billion, up $650 million versus last quarter. Let me break this provision number down for you. On the wholesale portfolio, we took pool reserves of $700 million, as modeled losses under CECL were higher relative to the first quarter, principally as a function of macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, worsening in the second quarter relative to similar inputs during the first quarter. The $700 million included both higher loss expectations and lower recovery rates. We also took impairments on wholesale loans of $540 million primarily related to credits in the industrials, TMT and natural resource sectors. Included in the $540 million of impairments, was $155 million related to Hertz as the company declared bankruptcy. This impairment was the largest in the quarter and was offset by gains on hedges which served as a risk mitigant. With hedged gains reported in the lending sub-segment of investment banking. In our consumer portfolio, provisions of $305 million increased versus last quarter, reflecting $220 million of reserve build an $85 million of net charge offs. During the quarter we recognized firm wide net charge offs of $260 million, resulting in an annualized net charge off ratio of 0.9%, up 40 basis points versus last quarter. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans increased 120 basis points to 3.7% for our $105 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.8% and for consumer loans of 17%. Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $8.4 billion increased versus last year. This includes higher compensation expense in line with revenue growth. Our non-comp expense growth was driven by $120 million increase in brokerage, clearing and exchange fees from higher client activity, $130 million of investments related to technology and new businesses including Apple Card and PFM and $100 million in CIE expense, which should decline as we harvest these investments, and roughly $900 million increase in litigation. Our reported year-to-date efficiency ratio was 67%, which was burdened by over 5 percentage points due to litigation. We continue to make progress on our medium term, expense savings initiatives set forth at Investor Day and expect to realize additional planned reductions in non-compensation expenses through the back half of the year. Finally, our reported tax rate was 22% for the year-to-date, reflecting the impact of higher earnings on permanent tax benefits and non-deductible expenses. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13, as I mentioned common Tier-1 equity ratio for the firm was 13.6% at the end of the second quarter, under the standardized approach, up 110 basis points sequentially more than recouping the decline seen in the first quarter. The improvement was driven largely by earnings and RWA management. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 10 basis points to 12.4% as higher capital was partially offset by higher RWAs due to a full quarter impact of increased market volatility. On the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion up 5% versus last quarter. We maintain strong liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging a record $290 billion, with growth largely commensurate with balance sheet expansion amid strong deposit growth. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $268 billion, up $48 billion versus last quarter, which should enable us to maintain low levels of wholesale financing activity for the balance of the year has had been our intention. In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise and our ability to provide differentiated [advice] [ph] and market access in a volatile environment. We maintain a prudent risk orientation, mindful of continued uncertainty in the markets and the ongoing health crisis. Our core businesses are performing well and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which set the foundation for our ability to serve our clients through this challenging time. With that, thank you again for dialing in and we'll now open up the line for questions. Thanks, David, and thanks, Glenn, for the question. Just to sort of pivot off of David's comments, I would say the important thing to think about in the context of activity is that we were experiencing, as David put it, very elevated volumes at wider bid offer. And Goldman Sachs sort of went through the market and didn't pull back and away from the market. And in doing that, we picked up market share, which I think will have lasting effect, notwithstanding where the market goes in terms of its dynamic. And the other thing I would point out is that in working through those flows, we managed risk really well, meaning we were not with elevated inventory, we saw high velocity turn in our risk in serving the intermediation needs of the clients and I think that's an important point to make. On the financing side of the business overall, it's important to bear in mind financing and FICC was up about 71%. We saw considerable strength both in repo and in structured credit. We saw similar activity on the equity financing side as well. As it relates to SCB and CCAR, I think that the ability of the firm to be agile and take our capital ratio up to 13.6% kind of takes SCB off the table and capital off the table in terms of our ability to present ourselves into the third quarter and beyond is ready and open to play the role we did in the second quarter, which is stand ready to meet the intermediation and trading needs of our clients. And I think the final comment, I'd make just on capital is that, we said during Investor Day that we would be agile, meaning we would be agile with the deployment of capital in and around the businesses of the firm. Now, at the time, the questions that came to us were more about the ability to pull capital from the securities business not put to it, in this quarter, we moved capital to it, returns were extraordinary, super attractive and we were able to move that around, you know, as the kind of flexible organization that we'd like to think of ourselves as and we'll continue to do that based on what the market opportunity shows us. No, I mean, Glenn, I think you characterized it exactly well, and you hit the point, which was our motivation for the sale itself, which is, this was a business that began in 2004. It was spun-off in the second quarter of '13. And over time, because of its intensity as a financial institution, it becomes more capital intensive. So, obviously, our motivation is to free up that capital and deploy it elsewhere around. We were about 25% of the ownership we're selling out, if not all, then, the preponderance of our position on that sale will release about $2.2 billion of risk weighted assets and about $400 million of attributed equity. I'd also point out that this is part and parcel of kind of a larger move that will take place over the course of the entire year, which is this will be part of about $4 billion of sales, off the balance sheet, all part of our broader strategy of looking at lower capital intensity, lower balance sheet, intense investments and moving more towards third-party funds. And so we will by the end of the year, reduce that down by about $4 billion. That will relieve us of about $2 billion of capital and about $13 billion of risk weighted assets, again, Global Atlantic being part of that. I would say roughly speaking, almost half of that is done, with the other half announced and spoken for and expected through the balance of the year. Sure. Thanks, Christian. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we remain committed over the medium term to the range of 13% to 13.5%. I think we're executing at the moment in the moment, meaning we're in the midst of a pandemic. Obviously, the results around CCAR and the SCB fixing was higher than what we had expected and perhaps reflects a view about where we are at a moment in the market. But I think our strategy as articulated and Investor Day and frankly speaking what I described in the path toward reducing down capital intensity of our balance sheet investing are all part and parcel of our ability to take down, what is otherwise meant to be represented in the peak to trough in the SCB. And so we're executing now, we are in a position having grown back our capital ratio to be within narrow distance of what's required. But again, that's a moment, I wouldn't fix a permanent capital buffer, nor look to amend what I view is our medium to long-term objective for a profile of the business, which will benefit from key strategic initiatives, which will lower the capital intensity of where we're going. And I think that's the forward path. And so, we'll remain quick on our feet as it relates to this. But I just want to give you a sense of what the forward direction is for the firm itself. Sure. Sure. So a non-comp expense is, as you suggest ex-litigation, our non-comp expenses are up about 9%. And a good portion of that increase is attributable to variable expense like BC&A. So this is expense, obviously related to the nature and level of activity that we experienced in the business. And the other portion of that increase is largely related to new businesses or larger size businesses than where we were a year ago. So think, the acquisition of United Capital expenses associated with it, or Apple Card. And so expense control has been on the front of our mind. What I expect to play out in the back half of the year, we'll be as we've said previously, the benefits from a reduction in double occupancy expense relating to real estate, two buildings, both in London and in Bangalore that roll off and so as we've long planned and expected, that will benefit us in terms of the reduction in non-comp expense overall. On a more structural plane and thinking back to the $1.3 billion of expense reduction that we articulated, frankly, I think we come at that number now, with greater confidence in the in that number and frankly the ability to exceed it over the medium to long-term. And part of that is informed by judgments that we are making and analysis that we're undergoing, not just simply about the size of the firm, but where the physical location of the firm can be. That is our ability to take aggregation of people or whole businesses and look to move them to different locations either around the world or around the country. And I think the flexibility and the agility that we can take from what we've witnessed in the context of the last several months, only feeds our confidence in the ability to do that and therefore our ability to hit the $1.3 billion target or better over time. Sure. So on deposits, your observation is right. I mean total deposits for the firm now is $268 billion that's up $48 billion quarter-on-quarter. Marcus deposits now, again, through the retail channel are at $92 billion that was up $20 billion in the second quarter. And we're also seeing deposits commence or not yet operational in the transaction banking deposit side. So the growth in the deposit channels overall has been really, really positive. The question of whether we can harvest the precise level of savings of $1 billion that we forecast, rests largely on market sort of developments. What I mean by that is, the deposits in retail currently are from a financial point of view, less valuable in the moment than where they were in the January Investor Day, meaning we've seen Fed funds come down by about 150 basis points but we haven't experienced corresponding beta on the downside in the retail deposit channel. That will come over time as we develop a more sort of substantive and profound level of engagement with retail customers, the reliance on rate will become less so and we'll be able to sort of capture back where we were. But I'd say that much of what we premised our Investor Day presentation on was an assumption about normal markets were not normal markets, the precipitous decline in rates but not a corresponding decline in deposits will lessen some of the savings but I wouldn't sort of put too much of a permanent conclusion to that, let's wait until we get to a more permanent state of a normal market to sort of judge that. By the way, by contrast, we do see positive beta in other channels which play that way, particularly in the high net worth channel. But I think we'll need to sort of assess just the magnitude. By the way, none of that is to take away from the strategic value of this consumer and the overall deposit channel, which is enabling us, frankly, faster than we thought to take out the wholesale funding channel. And just by way of reference, we've got about $10 billion of wholesale debt through the balance of this year, either maturing or subject to call and we'll be able to sort of act on that reducing down the liquidity that we hold all as a consequence of the growth that we've seen in the deposit channel overall. Yes. So, you have the facts, right. I mean by the end of the year, as I said, will free up about $2 billion, which is 50% of the way toward the objective of four. I would say that, I don't view that four as being in any way, the limit of what we can get done, the more we can advance and increase the cadence on the migration to low our capital density investing, the better will be and we'll continue to pursue that. Obviously, there's two sides to this that are both progressing. I mean, on one hand, we're effectuating sales that will relieve us of capital, but we're doing that not leaving ourselves in kind of a canyon of activity in that as we said during the prepared remarks, we've really advanced on the raise of our first fund inside of 30 days, having a first close in excess of 6 billion with a target of greater than 10. And while we set out the objective of doing about $100 billion of raise in and across a range of different funds, I think we all have an expectation that will exceed the $20 billion target we thought we would get to this year and look to revise targets across all of this as in when we think it appropriate. But, this is good forward progress and we're very determined to see it happen. So, I think the premise of your question Betsy sort of strikes at the answer, which is, we do have capital flexibility to elevate our VAR using VAR as a basis or as a metric if you will, for extending into client needs. So, both responding to the need for intermediation and positions deploying capital against it, and equally being responsive to the possibility of the market inflating, such that VAR increases in the context of inflated notional positions with particular credits. And so I think we feel very comfortable and part of the reason to take up our capital to sort of adequate levels relative to where we will be required to be, I mean, gives us greater confidence to see VAR inflate to the extent that we are in a position to serve our clients in periods of continued uncertainty as David's been speaking about in the markets more broadly. Well, I don't think any of us are in a position to make such a declarative judgment about the exact direction of trading revenues in through the second half of the year. I think that, what we need to do is set ourselves up to be in the service of clients and avail ourselves of the benefit of our shareholders of the opportunities as they present. And I think David characterized it well, which is, the second half will be more characterized by uncertainty than any ability to forecast up or down in the market itself. And I think we're well positioned from a liquidity from a capital and from a risk point of view to be able to avail ourselves. The one thing I would say, as we think about risk in markets like this is drawing the distinction between, what's liquid and what's not. So when I look at the firm, I think that inventory was managed in the pursuit of intermediation in the trading business exceptionally well. We saw very high velocity as we've long been looking to work with our securities leadership to do, in terms of seeing quicker turnover in inventory in support of trading activity. When I look at illiquid, this is an area where from a risk point of view, we use market opportunities to lower for example, commitments made in the deals book and took that book down and took risk down and position ourselves now to take on more risk in through the second half of the year, to the extent that those opportunities present themselves. And so, I feel quite good and confident about where we stand from a risk position, not limited to what we do in trading activity, which will present itself but equally around other areas of the firm, with more structural and kind of less liquid risks to take on board. Mike, the only thing I would add to David's comment is that and this goes back to the initial question you asked which is what are we doing with our clients? I mean, you can look in the capital markets at, the need to apply more creativity to structured solutions for clients than perhaps what we've seen in kind of straightway issuance in more normalized markets. Look at the deal that was completed for United Airlines, which I think brings some interesting ingenuity and structure to what otherwise in the normal course, would have been a fairly straightway financing. And I think that's the nature and level of engagement with the clients that we're experiencing. And I think, it responds a bit to the question of where the capital markets going. There may be more of a need of that right in the uncertainty that David's been addressing. Yes. I think the way to think about it is that, in the end we're looking to continue to build out kind of three components of that business, there's obviously our ultra high net worth business, there's a high net worth business PFM, which was the United Capital, I think Folio serves to clearly provide added heft to that component of what we're trying to build. The third leg in that stool would obviously be a more mass affluent consumer piece. But the acquisition of Folio was clearly aligned with the strategy begun under United Capital and the provision of third-party custody more broadly. So I think it fits both a generalized strategy, but equally it is entirely consistent with what we were trying to build out in the high net worth or PFM space, which was the United Capital asset itself. Sure. So the way we think about it is that each and every quarter, we've taken accrual as at that quarter as to what we forecast, we need to pay the organization and compensate the organization on a pay for performance basis. And it's not more than that there's no signaling that's embedded in it or otherwise. I think a good deal of the savings is not anticipated in the context of lowering our comp ratio. It's really looking at the balance of expenses that I was addressing to an earlier question in terms of what we can do to bring down some of the non-comp expense and overall bring our operating expenses down. But fixing this at 35%, as you may remember, we were at 33.8% last year, and so this is an ongoing quarter-by-quarter assessment of what we need to do taking a look at the overall performance of the business itself. Sure. So I would say that for us pursuing both passive petition and action is right meaning there's a do it yourself proposition here, which is to drive what we've been talking about that is lower capital intensity, balance sheet investing, third-party funds and the like. All of that is subject to self help. And we are minded to aggressively address that, so as to bring the intensity down. As a related matter, I think as you would imagine, we have been very active in our engagement and discussions with the Fed about the very observation you're making, which is when we look back historically, at our own performance, volatility carries a positive correlation for trading revenue and it's not uncorrelated and we have a view about what that means in the context of what the downdraft would be and have been engaged in a very active dialogue with the Fed on that topic. How to handicap the outcome of that is an impossibility and so it is why not withstanding that petition we continue to engage in self-help and look to remedy this on our own terms. Well, I think the rating agencies appropriately take a look at the advanced and remember, this has the CVA component in it that's not represented in standardized. And so you've got to be mindful in managing all of these capital ratios that there's not one but many constituencies to bear in mind. And so we do that and obviously pay attention to all of these ratios in the context of how we carry ourselves. Sure. So why don't I start on deferrals or forbearance, so, it's quite light across our whole portfolio, there's only about 3% of our total credit that is itself subject to forbearance. It's higher in the consumer portfolio, it's been about 10% of the total portfolio that has taken up forbearance, interestingly of those that do about 50% are current on their payments. But bear in mind, that's a very small component of the overall risk profile of the firm at $7 billion total. So overall, across the whole of it, it's about 3%. It's not significant in the context of how we operate and how we think about the risk overall, given how low it is. I would say as it relates to the consumer, it is one reason why the coverage ratio that we have through our reserve on a consumer portfolio is as high as it is at 17%. That's not at all a reflection of our current experience in terms of losses. Losses actually are trending lower, notwithstanding the moment in the market, but out of prudence and caution and given how young that portfolio is and given the fact that forbearance can match risk. We've taken up our provision there. More generally on your question about provisioning, as you know, we've took a provision of $1.6 billion in the quarter, the methodology we use is the same, we did in the first and we'll hold ourselves going forward, which is we look at macro economic indicators, including unemployment, that sort of correlate well to expectations around default rates, and then pull that through to avail ourselves of pool reserves. And we broke that down in the prepared remarks, which amounted to about $700 million of the 1.6 that's there, with the balance being impairments and the consumer component of provisions that I spoke about. It leaves us with a coverage ratio of about 3.7%, which I think is roughly in line with where the market is and accurately reflecting risk that's there. So what happens in the forward, it'll purely be a function of what plays out in the market and whether certain of these macro economic indicators worsen or improve from here and that obviously, will flow through our model and dictate the level of provisioning, we take."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 15, 2020. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.\nHeather Kennedy Miner: Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Today, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with the firm\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including our organizational resilience and business continuity and our efforts to support our communities around the world. Then he will speak to our results in the context of the recent market volatility and the broader operating environment. Stephen will then discuss our first quarter results in detail, including the firm\u2019s strong financial position and our execution priorities in the current environment. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I will now pass the call over to David. David?\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Heather and thank you everyone for joining this morning. First and foremost, all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are grappling with an unprecedented global crisis that is putting extraordinary pressure on all society, on families, on small business owners, on large companies, on non-profit organizations, on governments and economies around the world, and of course on the healthcare system. There is no doubt some segments of society, particular our most vulnerable communities and small businesses are suffering more than others. Thankfully there are areas of inspiration. To all of the frontline workers, including doctors, the nurses, the individuals showing up to work everyday to keep our supermarkets, our pharmacies, and our public transportation operating through this crisis, we are extremely grateful to you and we are in awe of your courage and dedication. From where we sit today, it is too early to know the full impact or to predict the specific path to recovery. But I am confident, particularly in light of the decisive and thoughtful actions being taken around the world by the public and private sector that together we will overcome this adversity. Our people have demonstrated time and time again extraordinary resilience and the ability to grow and adapt to change. I am enormously proud of how our colleagues have risen to the occasion in recent weeks. They have been working tirelessly to help our clients navigate the challenging and volatile markets brought about by this pandemic. And as a leadership team, our first priority remains the safety and well-being of all of our Goldman Sachs teammates. To do this, we activated a comprehensive global business continuity plan. This has been an extraordinary effort with exemplary performance from all involved, especially our engineering and operation teams admits the significant increase in market volatility. Over the past months now, we have been operating with approximately 98% of our global employees working remotely, while handling 2x to 3x the normal trading volumes and maintaining very high levels of engagement across all our stakeholders from corporations and institutions to individuals. Across the globe, including our teams in Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City, we successfully outfitted employees with the necessary technology to work, communicate and engage without interruption. Our smooth transition is a testament to our forward planning, technology capabilities and business resiliency. At a time of reduced market liquidity, our people are working relentlessly to support our clients. This effort includes intensive engagement by our operations team who worked alongside their industry counterparts to clear the extraordinary volumes of trades, sales and margin activity. Throughout these events, the level of cooperation among financial institutions and the dedication and resiliency of our people is inspiring. We are also staying very close to our corporate clients. Over the past few weeks, I have personally spoken to almost 100 CEOs to share best practices, offer advice and often to take advice from them. They face a variety of challenges, including distribution and supply chain disruptions and cash flow uncertainty. Many are working to keep their employees on the payroll despite a significant revenue headwind. I am broadly impressed by the private sector efforts to work together to help our communities navigate this crisis. For our part to help support corporate financing needs, we are proud that in recent weeks we have reopened markets and underwritten a record amount of U.S. dollar investment grade debt for clients. In addition, we have been an active participant in programs announced by the Federal Reserve to support the economy. We are also supporting the flow of capital in international markets. This year, we have led over $15 billion of Fight COVID-19 bonds, including issuances for the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, Austria, France and Indonesia, where proceeds will be used to alleviate the economic and social impacts of the pandemic. During this period, we have also been actively engaged with our individual customers across the wealth spectrum. This is included providing advice, financing, execution and investing opportunities for our PWM and high net worth clients. In consumer banking, it has been providing uninterrupted access to our digital deposits, lending and payments products and continuous service through our call centers, which are now operating virtually. We have also taken important steps to support our consumer banking clients through this challenging time. We were early to announce the COVID-19 customer assistance program in March and we have now extended it to April giving our customers the flexibility to skip a monthly payment without penalty or interest. More broadly over the past 6 weeks, John, Stephen and I have remained in active dialog with central banks, governments and regulators. We commend the rapid, forceful and unprecedented fiscal and regulatory responses designed to ensure liquid and well-functioning capital markets and to provide emerging fee financing to small businesses and individuals that need it most. These actions will undoubtedly help mitigate the demand shocks caused by the virus and speed the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. government along with the ECB, Bank of England and other global central banks have sent a clear message that they will decisively support the broader economy with the global banking system as an active partner. Goldman Sachs, alongside many other financial institutions, is prepared to play our part to help communities and businesses, both small and large, suffering from the economic impact of this devastating health crisis. We are harnessing our resources, experience and network to help where we can. We are working with public and private sector clients to partner on new initiatives with a focus on community assistance and economic support for businesses and serving our clients and customers. For our part, we have taken a number of important steps, including making a $550 million commitment to COVID-19 relief efforts. We will help small business owners weather this challenging time to $500 million for small business loans and $25 million in grants to community development financial institutions who have a long track record of reaching underserved communities and businesses. We have worked with many of these mission-driven lenders for years through our 10,000 small business programs. In addition, we launched a COVID-19 relief fund with $30 million commitment through Goldman Sachs Gives, including a special employee matching grant program to help healthcare workers, families and the most vulnerable populations. Lastly, in response to the well-publicized shortage of equipment for health professionals, we continued to donate supplies to frontline workers who need the most. Across the U.S. and Europe, we have donated 2.5 million surgical masks and 700,000 N95 masks, which we acquired over a number of years following prior epidemics like SARS as a part of our operational risk management efforts. As the situation rapidly evolves, we will continue to adapt our response for supporting the broader financial system, our clients, our people and our communities. More broadly, these are defining times for organizations. Adversity compels us to innovate, to leverage new technologies and to find new ways of thinking and interacting. At Goldman Sachs, we have always prided ourselves of doing that to help our clients succeed and we continue to execute on this commitment as we move forward. With that context, I will turn to the quarter on Page 2 of the earnings presentation to discuss our financial results. In the first quarter, net revenues were $8.7 billion, roughly flat versus a year ago. Net earnings were $1.2 billion resulting in earnings per share of $3.11 and ROE of 5.7% and a return on tangible equity of 6%. The first quarter proved to be two very different operating periods with a solid January and February followed by a challenging and volatile backdrop in March. In both contexts, our franchise businesses performed well. From a client perspective, we maintained our leading position as a strategic advisor to our investment banking clients in period of stress. We delivered solid growth in FICC and equities on high levels of client engagement as we extended balance sheet liquidity to clients during the most volatile markets in March. We continue to advise our wealth management clients and accelerated deposit growth in our digital consumer banking business. In asset management, we saw direct impact from market dislocation as our on-balance sheet equity and debt investments experienced material mark-to-market losses from falling asset prices. We also recognized higher credit losses and bolstered our reserves. Challenges notwithstanding we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with capital ratios above our minimum and robust levels of liquidity. Importantly, our franchise remains strong and we feel well-positioned to deliver best-in-class advice, execution and risk expertise to every client engagement. Turning to the operating environment on Page 3, the financial markets started the year on solid footing fueled by continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment. Our business performed well in both January and February as markets notched new highs driven by client confidence in activity. This backdrop however deteriorated with unprecedented speed in early March as financial markets began to brisance [ph] of the severe risks from the spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the dramatic measures needed to contain it. We witnessed spikes and volatility across most financial assets and global markets. The S&P 500 declined sharply from all-time highs in February and the VIX hit new highs. We also witnessed significant widening of credit spreads in both investment grade and high yield and de-risking from clients across all asset classes. Given our strong financial position, we were able to commit our balance sheet on behalf of clients and support strong volumes across our global market franchise as investors sought to reduce risk exposure. The very high levels of activity demonstrate the strength and scope of our franchise and our ability to serve clients as an important risk intermediary. Looking forward, our economists expect a very significant near-term decline in growth followed by a rebound in the second half of the year when they expect us to get back about 50% of the decline in output that we lose in the first two quarters. More specifically, annualized U.S. GDP is forecasted to decline in excess of 30% in the second quarter before recovering in the third and fourth quarters resulting in an economic contraction of about 6% of the year. This compares to growth expectations of over 2% just a few months ago. There is obviously a wide range of uncertainty around forward projections given the unknown duration of the health crisis. The reality is that none of us know for sure. This is why it is critically important during this difficult period that we maintain a strong financial profile and remain agile and flexible in our service to our clients. Lastly, I\u2019ll share a few comments on our Investor Day commitments. While January seems distant under these circumstances, more distant under these circumstances than the ten or so weeks that have passed, the strategic direction we laid out for the firm remains no less compelling. Strengthening our core businesses, expanding in new and adjacent businesses, and operating with greater efficiency, remain ever important to the firm. We established targets that contemplated in normal operating environment. And clearly, this is not a normal operating environment. Yet our targets represent medium and long-term goals, which we still aspire to. Interestingly, this environment has created opportunities for us to accelerate our strategic plans in certain areas. Our transaction banking rollout remains on track and our growth in corporate deposits has exceeded expectations. In our alternatives business, we have accelerated fundraising on a strategic solution fund of meaningful size to help clients take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. In our high net worth business, we completed our re-branding of United Capital, the Goldman Sachs\u2019 personal financial management on schedule in March, and our strong growth in consumer deposits continues to underscore the strategic importance of that business. You should expect us to manage through the current environment dynamically with our priorities of serving clients and protecting the long-term value of our franchise. We will adjust our tactical response as appropriate, which may impact the timing, cadence of the size of certain investments. That says our strategic goals remain in place. As we execute, we look forward on updating you \u2013 to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you, David. Good morning to you all. Let me begin with our summary results on page 4. During the first quarter, three of our four business segments produced revenue growth in excess of 20% versus the year ago period reflecting the strength of our franchise and the elevated level of activity in March. These results were offset by losses in our asset management business due to the significant decline in the fair value of our long-term investments in equity, debt securities, and loans. We also took a material provision for credit losses in the quarter. Despite the difficult backdrop, our overall revenue levels remained relatively flat versus a year ago, reflecting the diversification of our businesses. Before turning specifically to our results, I want to reflect for a moment on the financial strength of the firm and the U.S. banking system coming into this period of volatility, in terms of capital, liquidity and risk. I also want to provide insight into where Goldman Sachs stands on those metrics as we enter the second quarter. The industry came into this market dislocation with a robust financial position, as the capital levels for large banks, more than doubled over the past decade to approximately $1 trillion. Our capital stands above our minimums, with the reduction in our CET1 ratio during the quarter, a reflection of a very purposeful deployment of balance sheet on behalf of clients. As David noted, our liquidity is very strong, averaging over $240 billion during the quarter and remains at a level higher than that now. Our risk positions remain balanced, controlled, and adequately provisioned for, both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure. Our ability to serve as a principle intermediary of risk, the source of liquidity and a provider of balance sheet, on behalf of clients is rooted in the sound financial footing of the firm and our long history of being a firm that clients turn to in challenging moments. Across Goldman Sachs, our forward planning and risk management practices enabled us to be well prepared. The liquidity and capital buffers we hold are intended for times like these, and we prudently deploy our financial resources to serve our clients during the first quarter. As a function of the regular stress testing that we and the industry have undertaken over the past decade, our liquidity and capital metrics are sized to withstand severely adverse scenarios. During the time of increased market volatility and disruption, our ability to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrates the dedication of our people, the strength of our engineering and our business resiliency in addition to the financial standing of the organization. In short, Goldman Sachs is open for business. Let\u2019s turn to our business performance on Page 5 beginning with Investment Banking. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 25% versus a year ago quarter. First quarter financial advisory revenues of $781 million were down 9% sequentially and down 11% versus last year amid fewer deal closings, consistent with lower industry volumes. During the quarter, we participated in nearly $250 billion of announced transactions and closed 68 deals for nearly $200 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A league table rankings. We continue to engage with clients about significant changes in the economic environment and the implications for the M&A business. Given the new set of challenges facing a variety of industries, we expect client demand to evolve as they seek our assistance, bolstering balance sheets, hedging market and financial risks, and capturing strategic opportunities. While there are clearly some industries that are more directly impacted than others, dialogs with clients are at elevated levels across all verticals, as this crisis impacts clients of all types and in all regions. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $378 million were flat versus the fourth quarter and up 44% versus a slow period for IPOs in the first quarter of last year. For the quarter, we ranked number two globally in equity underwriting, with $12 billion in volume across 80 transactions, as we executed a number of key IPOs during the first two months of the quarter. Additionally, following the market pullback, we helped a number of clients raise capital in the convertible market through public and private transactions. Notably, we led a number of high-profile-type issuances for a variety of companies, including Wayfair and Twitter. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $583 million, down 3% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% from a year ago. Activity this quarter reflected growth in asset-backed and leverage finance activity. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our Number 4 global debt underwriting league table ranking and our ability to provide clients access to the investment grade and below investment grade markets, even through the challenging environment in March. As David mentioned, in the last two full weeks of March, we saw record U.S. dollar investment grade issuance with over $170 billion of activity. Of that, Goldman Sachs helped raise nearly $75 billion of financing for clients, capturing over 13% share, roughly double versus last year, evidencing our client engagement and commitment to market access. Helping clients access public market financing windows also enabled us to better risk manage our portfolio of acquisition finance commitments, as certain bridge in other facilities were taken out in permanent financings in the capital markets. Our investment banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter but rose versus a year ago. Given the environment, we expect announcement timelines on several larger transactions in our backlog to be delayed. That said, we maintain active dialogs with clients across our global franchise and know that market conditions can evolve quickly. Revenues from corporate lending were $442 million, nearly double the fourth quarter and up over three-fold versus a year ago, driven by approximately $375 million of hedge gains relating to our relationship lending book on wider credit spreads during the quarter. We maintain single-name hedges on certain larger commitments as a prudent risk management tool. The hedge gains could, of course, reverse in future quarters should credit spreads tighten. As a reminder, corporate lending includes middle-market lending, relationship lending and acquisition financing. In the quarter, gains on single-name and index hedges as well as net interest income on the portfolio more than offset fair value marks on our acquisition financing commitments. During the quarter, we saw approximately $19 billion of corporate commitment draw-downs in relationship lending as we supported our clients\u2019 liquidity needs during this difficult time. While we saw a higher percentage of draw-downs from our non-investment grade clients, given the larger size of our investment grade book, the $19 billion was roughly evenly split on a notional basis between investment grade and non-investment grade. These draws were within our expectations for a stress scenario and were below the amount pre-funded in our liquidity pool. During this period, we also saw significant inflows in commercial deposit accounts tied to our new transaction banking platform. These deposit balances totaled $9 billion and we\u2019re now serving over 80 clients, reflecting the early diversification benefits of our new business growth strategy. Moving to Global Markets on Page 6, net revenues were $5.2 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially and up 28% versus last year. Growth was driven by significantly higher client activity amid wider bid-ask spreads and solid risk management in a challenging market. As we noted at our Investor Day, our results in global markets, like all segments, include fully allocated costs. As such, our reported quarterly results in global markets were burdened by a charge of approximately $500 million related to valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with widening of credit and funding spreads. FICC net revenues were $3 billion, up 68% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year. Growth versus last year was driven by an 18% increase in financing and 36% growth in intermediation revenues. Within FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows across all of our businesses, with four out of five business lines posting higher first quarter net revenues versus last year; again, reflecting the value of our standing commitment to a diversified FICC franchise. In currencies, we saw a very active quarter with meaningful revenue improvement as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume and strong performance in the Americas and Asia. We continued to on-board new clients to our Marquee and eFX platforms during the quarter, and produced record results in this business, reflecting our significant investments in recent years, changing client workflows, and our willingness to provide liquidity during market stress. Our rates franchise also performed well, given high levels of client intermediation and despite the challenge of managing risk positions through a significant jump in volatility as central banks around the world cut rates and the Fed and ECB launched significant quantitative easing programs. In commodities, our business delivered strong results in oil, as we worked with our clients to manage extraordinary price volatility. We also generated solid performance in metals. These positive results were partly offset by CVA from wider counterparty credit spreads. In credit, our performance was solid across our global franchise. We benefited from significantly higher client activity in more liquid index CDS products and notably in client portfolio trades, which more than offset the impact of wider credit spreads amid lower liquidity in cash product trading inventory. Like in our currencies business, our technology platforms in credit enabled us to serve clients in period of market dislocation with both buyers and sellers benefiting from our global franchise, capital commitment, and the efficiency of our digital platforms. In mortgages, net revenues fell, as significantly higher client activity was offset by wider spreads impacting our inventory, particularly in agencies, as we saw de-leveraging across the market. Importantly, our performance was cushioned by the capital and risk reduction measures we executed over the past several years. Lastly in FICC financing, we saw a considerable strength in our repo business as we helped clients navigate dislocated funding markets, which have begun to normalize in recent weeks. Turning to equities, on Page 7, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.2 billion, up 28% versus the fourth quarter and up 22% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 32% versus a year ago aided by derivatives given higher equity market volatility and significantly higher client volumes. This was partially offset by a more difficult market making backdrop in Europe, given unexpected dividend cuts. Equities financing revenues of $666 million rose 4% year-over-year, driven by higher average quarterly, prime client balances. Moving to asset management on Page 8, collectively, our asset management activities produced negative net revenues of $96 million in the first quarter, first quarter management and other fees totaled $640 million, up 5% versus a year ago, driven by higher client assets under supervision. Incentive fees increased to $154 million driven primarily by asset harvesting, including closing a key Special Purpose Acquisition Company or SPAC transaction. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by marks on our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Losses here reflect the sharp market declines during the quarter, given the majority of our assets in this segment are accounted for at fair value. Our equity investments produced $22 million of net losses in the first quarter as material gains generated on the pending or close sale of certain investments in January and February were more than offset by broader markdowns on our public and private equity holdings in March. More specifically on our $19 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of approximately $775 million from event driven items including agreements to sell our investment in a UK student housing portfolio and our investment in AirTrunk, a datacenter in Australia. Gains from these dispositions were offset by approximately $500 million of marks on our private equity positions, reflecting the underlying operating performance of the businesses and roughly $500 million of marks on our $2 billion public equity portfolio including $180 million loss on Avantor and significantly smaller losses across the broader portfolio. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were a negative $868 million attributable to mark to market losses on debt securities and fair value loans. As shown on Page 9, this segment houses a $29 billion credit portfolio including $13 billion of fair value debt securities and $16 billion of corporate and real estate loans, of which $4 billion are held at fair value. This portfolio includes a range of investing activities executed by our private credit group and multi-strategy investing teams, which have historically generated solid contributions to firm performance over many years. That said, in the first quarter, the fair market value component of the portfolio managed by these teams incurred significant credit spread widening which more than offset the ongoing net interest income from the portfolio itself. This drove significant losses across the portfolio of senior and mezzanine corporate loans and our broader portfolio of liquid corporate debt securities. As we go forward, we will continue to risk manage the credit portfolio, prudently. With respect to loans, while the majority of the portfolio is non-investment grade by design, it is well structured and over 85% is secured. We also would note that if spreads retrace, as they have in the first part of the second quarter, we could recoup a portion of the first quarter\u2019s losses. But of course, there is no assurance of that outcome. Turning to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page 10, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, increased transaction volumes and incentive fees and higher consumer banking revenues from deposits and lending products. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $959 million rose 21% versus last year, reflecting both organic growth and the United Capital acquisition. Assets under supervision rose 6% versus the prior year to $509 billion. We also saw higher incentive fees, while private banking and lending revenues declined. Consumer banking revenues were $282 million in the first quarter, rising nearly 40% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and credit card loan balances. Consumer deposits at quarter end totaled $72 billion across the U.S. and UK reflecting a record $12 billion of quarterly growth in the consumer platform. Performance in March was solid with $4 billion of monthly growth, providing a valuable source of funding to the firm. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7 billion of which $5 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $2 billion from credit card. Going forward, we expect to see a more modest level of growth in both Marcus unsecured loans and Apple Card as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation. Now let\u2019s turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total client assets for which we earn a management fee, including those in asset management and consumer and wealth management, totaled $1.8 trillion in the first quarter, down $41 billion versus the fourth quarter, but up $219 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by $114 billion of market depreciation offset by $72 billion of liquidity and $1 billion of long-term inflows. Switching gears on Page 12, let\u2019s address net interest income and our lending portfolio. Total firm-wide net interest income was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, up 23% sequentially, reflected in global markets and consumer given the impact of lower funding costs and continued deposit growth. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $128 billion, up $19 billion sequentially driven primarily by funded commercial revolvers in investment banking as I noted earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $937 million, up $600 million versus last quarter. During the quarter, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $131 million resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 0.5%. On the wholesale portfolio, we took impairments and bolstered our reserves, particularly for loans in the oil and gas sector given recent price declines. In our consumer portfolio, provisions related to markets were higher versus last quarter due primarily to CECL reserve rates even though realized net charge-offs declined. Additionally, we note out provisions during the quarter were impacted by higher levels of reserving for new loan growth under CECL which we adopted as planned. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses stood at $3.2 billion. Our allowance for funded loans under accrual accounting was 2.5%. Overall, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations given the recent economic deterioration. That said we continued to monitor the portfolio and brought our risk factors closely and will take any and all mitigating actions as appropriate. One area of particular focus is our lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector. At the end of March, we had approximately $14 billion of total lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector, net of roughly $600 million of hedges. Approximately $4 billion were funded loans. Our total exposure is diversified, with no single counterparty over $500 million before hedges just over half is non-investment grade of which over 70% is secured. And as a proportion of our overall wholesale credit book, our oil and gas exposure remains very manageable. Now, let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.5 billion increased 10% versus last year driven by significantly higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees attributable to higher client activity. Higher provisions for litigation and an increase in expenses related to real estate consolidated investments, including impairments. Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources consistent with our historical focus on expense discipline and the emphasis on cost control at Investor Day we will assess the timing, magnitude and pace of certain expenses and investments. Importantly, we continue to pursue our medium-term efficiency target. To that end, we expect to realize the effect of planned reductions in non-compensation expenses more significantly through the back half of the year. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 10% for the first quarter. Our lower rate reflected the impact of share-based compensation awards and the lower impact or \u2013 and the impact of lower pre-tax earnings on permanent benefits. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to select balance sheet data, on Slide 14, let me begin with capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 80 basis points sequentially driven by balance sheet and RWA growth in light of our meaningful client engagement during the quarter. Our ratio under the advanced approach decreased by 140 basis points to 12.3%, with the incremental decline versus standardized due to higher credit spread volatility. Our SLR was 5.9%, down 30 basis points sequentially also on balance sheet deployment to clients. This quarter, we returned a total of $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases notably at the beginning of the quarter and common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 356 million shares. As you will recall, Goldman Sachs and members of the Financial Services Forum voluntarily decided to temporarily suspend buybacks through the second quarter of 2020. This pause allows us to continue to deploy our resources to support our clients in the context of the current operating environment. We remain committed to allocating capital to accretive high return opportunities and when not deployed returning excess to shareholders. As it relates to our dividend, given our continued earnings generation and solid capital position, we feel comfortable maintaining our dividend. Further to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, up 10% versus last quarter. We maintained strong liquidity levels. As referenced earlier, our global core liquid assets averaged a record $243 billion, up $6 billion versus the fourth quarter. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $220 billion, up $30 billion versus last quarter with strong flows through our Marcus and transaction banking channels. As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy to remix our liabilities to our deposits. Our total unsecured long-term borrowings were $226 billion driven by $15.7 billion of vanilla debt issuance during the quarter as we accelerated issuance into the first quarter from what was intended for the back part of this year to better position ourselves to be in the service of our clients. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflected the volatile operating environment and our ability to navigate turbulent markets and support our client franchise. As we look toward the balance of the year, we take strength from our robust financial position, including capital and liquidity. Our client franchise remains strong and with the ongoing dedication of the talented professionals of Goldman Sachs, we will marshal the full resources of the firm to serve our clients during this unprecedented time. With that, thank you again for dialing in and we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. Appreciate it. I guess the tough one on getting you to talk about the linearity of reserves as possible, meaning you laid out the macro backdrop that you have taken reserves under if we roll forward a quarter, the world is a little worse or just delayed. Could you talk about how reserves shift as we shift out a quarter meaning if you \u2013 if we start thinking that the economic recovery is more like a 2021 event instead of second half event? Could you talk about the $937 million provision taken relative to how that changes with the pushing out of a recovery? I know that\u2019s a hard one.\nStephen Scherr: Sure, Glenn. Thank you. So as you know, the provision for credit loss we took was $937 million, about $686 million of that were in provisions and about $200 million of that related to the relationship loan book with the balance really guided by the crisis relating to COVID and growth in the overall portfolio. In answering your question, I will point out what we did in this quarter, because I think it will reflect a process that we will continue to look at which is we weigh a variety of macroeconomic scenarios, one that\u2019s optimistic, a base case and one that\u2019s downside in a quarter in which we sat and if circumstances played we heavily weighted a downside scenario that doesn\u2019t rely exclusively on our economist, but takes a broad look. And obviously, we don\u2019t know what the forward holds in the quarter. And so I think we will hone to the very same process we did, which is looking at a variety of scenarios, putting enough weight on a downside or a base case, or for that matter, one that\u2019s marginally more optimistic. It\u2019s worth pointing out that in these scenarios we take a look at what the contraction of GDP is. We look at unemployment, but we don\u2019t ignore the fact that there are a number of programs in place across a range of countries notably the U.S. where central banks and treasuries have put in place monitoring fiscal stimulus that has the potential to serve as some counterbalance, if you will, to what may play to the extent that holds and that accelerates a recovery. I have every expectation that reserves would reflect it if this continued on and that didn\u2019t have the efficacy that is otherwise intended one could imagine a scenario that plays more to the downside and I would expect provisions and losses to reflect the same. And so again hard to predict what the next quarter or subsequent quarters hold, but I think will rely and you should know that will rely on a pretty robust modeling exercise that will reflect to circumstances that we see in front of us.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Maybe one follow-up on the investment portfolios within asset management and I appreciate the detail you gave. Maybe you could help one on Part A and Part B one on equity, one on debt, on the equity side public are the publics and were down about in line with what the markets were. The private side is only a few percent so if you could talk to what differentiated about the portfolio and cash flow and composition and the diversity of it and why would warrant a lesser mark. And the different question on the debt side, debt lending side, the marks were pretty robust there given the spread widening, just curious if all of that was mark-to-market and nothing sold because spreads have obviously improved so far in April? Thank you.\nStephen Scherr: No, not a problem. So, let me give you kind of quick decomposition and I will start with equity. So we have a $21 billion equity portfolio, $19 billion of that is in private, $2 billion of that is in the public space. When you look at the P&L around it, I would say that on the positive side we realized about $775 million of gain principally generated around the harvesting of assets one as I mentioned being the UK housing platform and the other being the AirTrunk asset in Australia. So that generated positive revenues of $775 million. Also embedded in this was a $200 million revenue pickup in the context of CIEs that we keep independent of the equity portfolio. So think of that portfolio generating positive $1 billion or so. That was offset by both public and private mark. So in the public realm, we took down about $500 million of loss most notable within that was a $180 million of Avantor. On the $500 million of losses in the balance of the private portfolio that was spread across about 280 names. And so it\u2019s important just to understand that dispersion. I would also say that when you look at the private portfolio, you don\u2019t hone exclusively to kind of public market comparables, you look at the underlying performance of those businesses. And just to give you a little bit of insight into that, of that private portfolio, I would say 65% of it continued to perform well in the context of operating performance in the business, about 20% of that portfolio was impacted by COVID and was the source of a considerable number of the private marks taken and then 15% of portfolio was what\u2019s on positive gains in the harvesting that was there. Just to give you a breakdown and the reliance on underlying performance and/or events and not the exclusive reliance on a public sort of analog in terms of looking at that private portfolio. Let me turn now to answer your question on the debt side. So there it\u2019s a $29 billion portfolio, about $17 billion of that is fair value. So debt securities about $13 billion, loans about $4 billion, the balance of $12 billion are loans on an accrual basis. And so as you can imagine, the mark-to-market on the fair value was largely influenced by dramatic spread widening that was experienced in the quarter. We saw high yield spreads in the U.S. gap out by about 375 basis points, the same in Europe gapped out by about 435 basis points. Now as I noted, we have seen some retrenchment of that in the beginning part of the second quarter that doesn\u2019t do anybody any good as it related to marks taken in the first quarter, but just to give you a sense of the markets retrenchment as we began early. Now we will see what the rest of the quarter holds, but that just gives you a sense of balance in the context of both the acuity and the credit portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous. Please go ahead sir.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe first on sustainability of FICC strength, I think a sequential quarter performance of up 68% is probably the best of all banks that reported so far. So are you finally seeing payoff from your growth initiatives and feel actual share gains in this business? And then just given the strength of performance and more importantly the countercyclical nature of the business, does it change how you think about allocating capital to FICC over time?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. Thanks, Christian. I will start and Stephen might jump in. We have been \u2013 two parts of your question in my mind, the first is we have been very committed, this management team over the last 18 months, to running the diversified fixed income business at a point in time where the ability to differentiate in the intermediation part of that business was harder. We were in a very low volatility environment for a long period of time. You have seen us stay committed to a diverse business, where in some years some businesses do well, some businesses do poorly, but we really as we have reoriented the client focus of the organization, we believe that a full service platform would, through cycles, payoff for us. We have spent a lot of time really thinking about the way we connect with clients and the way we are servicing clients and trying to make that business over the last year less transaction-oriented and more client-oriented. Those investments based on the feedback we have and data we have having nothing to do with COVID have borne progress over the course of the last year, from a market share perspective both on an objective basis and also from a subjective feedback we are getting from our clients. In this quarter, you saw all people that operate the intermediation businesses benefit from higher volatility and more client activity. I am watching all the reporting of the other banks as you are. We think we benefited meaningfully from that because of the way we have invested in that business and we are well-positioned. How it continues going forward will depend on the environment and what the environment brings. In an environment that continues to have more elevated volatility and more changes in risk patterns for our clients, I think our franchise will continue to benefit. In terms of capital allocation, I think we have got the right amount of capital in that business, but look, you saw the operating leverage in that business when you look at the returns in that business based on how we are operating now. So again, we have always thought about through the cycle. I think our team performed very, very well in this business. I am glad we have stayed in the broad array of businesses given the environment that we are now in, but you will only be able to judge whether we have got the capital right and we stay zealously focused on this as we continue to run through the cycle. But we have no plans to change the capital allocation at the moment, other than to try to accommodate clients we grew risk weighted assets in the business which obviously attracts capital. We will continue to do that if it\u2019s attractive and it supports our clients.\nStephen Scherr: Christian, good morning. Couple of things I would add to David\u2019s answer, first to his point on capital allocation, it\u2019s bearing note as we report now in ways we hadn\u2019t before that FICC produced an ROE of 19.7%. And the reflection of the nimbleness and agility of capital, which was a topic discussed at our Investor Day is the ability to deploy capital where it\u2019s required and needed by our clients. And that\u2019s the way balance sheet flows in and around the firm and within the firm in terms of capital allocation. I\u2019d also point out that I think this business benefited and you heard us talk about this over the preceding one or two earnings calls where we took risk down generally speaking within this business. And so as a consequence, we came into this crisis with a more manageable risk profile and we are able to manage flows and be in the service of intermediating clients more thoroughly. I should point out as I may have misspoken, but growth markets producing ROE as a segment of 19.7%, but obviously FICC a big contributor to it in the context of our overall performance.\nDavid Solomon: The only other thing Christian I would add is that we have also been making significant investments in technology platforms to better serve our clients in this business and we saw a real benefit especially with everybody working remote on our technology connectivity and our platforms. And we think that\u2019s an investment that has paid off.\nChristian Bolu: Great. Thank you for the color. Maybe switching to the loan book I think the loan book has more than doubled over the last 3 years and has been a real source of revenue growth for the firm. I am just looking forward how are you thinking about loan growth both in terms of customer demand and your risk appetite to lend into global recession?\nStephen Scherr: So Christian, I will take that question. Look the abiding proposition for us obviously is to maintain appropriate risk management and equally be mindful of capital and liquidity and so taking those three as kind of the abiding governors. I have every expectation that the firm will continue both aggressively and offensively to extend credit in the interest of clients across a range of our businesses and equally to meet our client needs in the context of corporate draw-downs or other liquidity needs of the client itself. The book obviously stands at $128 billion. There was meaningful growth in the quarter occasioned by the relationship loan book being drawn by about $19 billion. But I think risk is obviously an important governor. And so I would just point out as an example in the context of the consumer book wherever committed to that business, but at this moment, in this environment we will be quite cautious in terms of credit extension and growing that book and will return to grow that book once this sort of circumstance and market volatility passes just as an example of how risk needs to be the governor in the context of managing this profile and the loan book overall.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First question just a follow-up on the asset management business and thanks for all the color so far. On the private equity portfolio versus the public equity portfolio, historically, how much of the valuations tend to be fairly close to the public markets versus what could we expect on a lag basis if the challenging backdrop ends up continuing?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So the philosophy that we brought and the accounting rigor we brought to marking our private portfolio frankly has not at all changed this quarter relative to what it has been historically. Meaning, we always look at events that play out as a reference point against which names or companies in which there has been an event either a sale or another investment into that name we market in that context, where there is in an event, we look at the underlying performance in the business in just the way I described we did it this way. And so underlying \u2013 the underlying performance of those businesses is having the true north in the way in which we look to mark that portfolio. Now as we look forward to the extent that we come into a quarter or multiple quarters, which ultimately weigh on the underlying performance and the underlying profitability of that portfolio company or set of companies, you are obviously then could be further marks and loss occasion by that and that would therefore be a lag. But I just want to layout the methodology we use in the context of how we market and equally point out that this quarter is no different than any other in the way in which we mark that book.\nMichael Carrier: Okay, that makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up, results in trading and banking held up well and I realized it\u2019s impossible to predict or to have too much clarity, but can you help us out or provide some context or color on where you are continuing to see elevated activity versus the areas where we could expect some normalization or falloff just given some of the pockets that we have seen over the past 9 months?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Michael. I mean, I will take a stab at talking a little bit about that. First in the investment banking business, the advisory business is always a lag. So we have a backlog of M&A deals that were struck earlier. Many of them will continue to close. That will bring some revenue into the second quarter. But as we go longer and we continue to be in an environment where there is very, very low confidence obviously as you witnessed over the last few weeks, there has been very little new M&A activity that\u2019s been initiated. During the time of low confidence, I would expect that to continue. So over time, the velocity of revenue accrual on the M&A side will slow until we get to a period of higher confidence. With respect to the financing side of the investment banking business, you have obviously seen in the last few weeks record levels of investment grade issuance, one record week after another and so debt financing has been very strong. You have seen some equity issuance and certainly with more stability in equity markets or companies are trying to bolster their balance sheet, bolster their liquidity and position themselves to ride out what maybe a longer period of economic contraction. That actually should accrue to our benefit in that business, because I think we are well positioned to capture our fair share of providing that liquidity and financing support. In the trading businesses in the early part of the quarter, we have seen heightened level of activity in the early part of the quarter. There is no guarantee obviously that continues as we go through the quarter, but in the early part of the quarter, we have seen our investing clients continue to be very, very active. I think we are going through a period \u2013 we were going through March period of significant de-risking. We have now been going through a period of repositioning. So our clients have been active. As you point out, it\u2019s very hard to say what that\u2019s going to look like 2, 3 months from now, but that\u2019s the view I give you at the moment.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So wanted to start off with a question on funding, one of the biggest drivers of the ROTCE build you laid out at Investor Day was the $1 billion benefit from funding optimization and retracted deposit costs pretty closely. We have seen a lot of your competitors aggressively match the Fed rate cuts, but you maintained very competitive deposit payouts, certainly help contribute to strong deposit growth this quarter. I was just hoping if you could update us on how your deposit strategy is evolving in the low rate environment and whether the flat yield curve and still elevated deposit payouts could impact that $1 billion funding benefit you cited out yesterday?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. Thank you, Steve. So let me start with sort of strategy around rate. We took our rate down actually yesterday in the U.S. relative to where it had been. Our strategy remains unchanged in that regard, which is we aim to be certainly not the top rate payer, but somewhere in the 3 or 4 category and we will continue to do that with an eye towards building out greater product attributes and a more formidable relationship with depositors such that we rely less on rate in the context of both drawing and maintaining deposits, but it\u2019s against that strategy that we saw at least for us record inflows on the deposit side. In terms of the medium-term target which we set out in Investor Day of achieving $1 billion of savings occasioned by the migration of our funding mix, that\u2019s no less an imperative for us now than it was then. And I would simply point out that the market will pull some volatility into the measurement. So again, this is a medium-term target that we will achieve. We will move closer and closer to 50% of our funding in deposits, the amount or the delta of savings, if you will, will be both a function of where we take deposit rates and as much as where wholesale funding obviously takes itself. And I think particularly in this market and most notably in March, this was a really good very stable source of funding for us, but I think the forward trajectory both as a strategy and then equally as it relates to our ability to harvest the kind of savings that we have talked about over the medium term is one that we are going to continue to adhere to and watch and achieve.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that. And just for my follow-up relating to expense management, I wanted to unpack some of your comments a bit more, you talked about savings initiatives helping reduce non-comps in the back half of this year, but just in terms of the near-term outlook, are you still comfortable with maintaining I believe the guidance was calling for flat non-comps, ex-litigation in 2020? And just given some of the recent disruption from COVID, whether that has informed or changed your strategy around executing on the long-term savings target of $1.3 billion?\nStephen Scherr: So there is no change relating to our medium-term target of achieving $1.3 billion. Now the early pace of that during this period of pandemic will obviously be slower, but this is a medium term or 3-year target and I think we will come out of this experience leaving clearer view as to sort of where changes can be made and where we can harvest expense reduction. In the near-term I am very much minded to achieve flat non-comp expense relative to where we were, but let me just be open and point to the variables. One is obviously, BC&E this is a variable expense that obviously plays in the context of market activity. We have seen more of it. And so as a consequence, we have seen more expense in that regard. On consolidated investments, it would have been my preference in a common market for us to have exited more of those consolidated investments and shed ourselves of some of those expenses whether the market permits that to happen over the balance of the year we will have to see. Obviously honing to flat non-comp was ex-litigation so I am just leaving that aside, but the two variables really just to be candid about it are BC&E relative to volumes and CIEs to the extent we can harvest it. Otherwise, we are quite focused on trying to sort of live to a flat non-comp expense year-over-year.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi, I just wanted to test your conviction on how much of a counterbalance, the economy should have for the monetary and fiscal actions and your conviction seems to be important, because it goes to your provisioning level which you said we had considered as part of that provision and the pace of additional financing for your clients and frankly for the advice that you give to your clients, I mean you are the biggest advisor to your corporations out there, I mean, what are you telling them as far as how they should proceed?\nDavid Solomon: So, thanks, Mike. I will start, Stephen might join in, but you are asking a multi-layered question. So on the first part of the question, there is no question that the response, the fiscal and monetary response is going to have a simulative effect, there is no question. When we come out of this and I am not making a prediction of when we will come out of it, but when we come out of it, it will have a stimulative effect versus a scenario where it didn\u2019t exist. The question that\u2019s so hard to answer and in my conversations with clients on having it constantly, we have to rebuild confidence in people\u2019s security and safety around the virus. We can all have economic forecast and we can all talk about the economic consequence of this, but unless people feel safe and secured and confident around the virus, the economic impact will continue in some way, shape or form. That is a very, very hard thing to predict. So I tried to encourage companies that we have talked to and individuals for that matter to hope for the better, but plan for the worst. And so certainly I think if you are trying to prepare for an economic environment, you have to view something that is a slower economic recovery as you come out of this. And look even if you look at the Goldman Sachs scenario was a very steep decline with a sharp increase in the second and third quarter they are still only predicting a 50% recovery of the output that was lost. So, I think for anybody operating a business you have to be planning on an assumption that we are going to be operating in a recession through 2020 into 2021 and you have to plan accordingly. Will the monetary policy and fiscal policy be a benefit to the positive of what that trajectory looks like in the third, fourth quarter and into the first half of next year? Yes, but it\u2019s very hard to quantify what that will be, because the uncertainty around the course that the virus will take and how it will affect human behavior is still very uncertain and anyone who is telling you they are sure that it will look like this or they are sure that it will look that, I don\u2019t think anybody is sure. And so I think this will be a gradual path. And as we have more information we will be able to better evaluate. What we are trying to do is ensure that in our organization where risk managing and provisioning appropriately as we can based on the information we can looking forward with that kind of a mindset.\nMike Mayo: Well, the other part of the question is given that how aggressively are you pursuing financing at this time to gain share by stepping in when others might not?\nDavid Solomon: Look, we are actively \u2013 we are focused on helping our clients across the organization. If you look at investment grade, you take an investment grade which has been very, very obvious and transparent. We picked up significant share over the course of the last four weeks. And so we think we are well-positioned to capture share. We are going to do it with prudent and a long-term view of our client franchise. And so we are long-term investors on our client franchise we always have been. There isn\u2019t an institution that does not have to make certain choices around how it allocates its capital at a time like this. We think we are good at that. We think we are nimble. But of course, we are going to lean into our client relationships and take a long-term view.\nStephen Scherr: Mike, I also would say that as a by-product of advice, if you look at the roster of corporations that have issued into both the investment grade and below investment grade markets what you will find are companies that are in certain industries that have been meaningfully impacted by the virus yet saw the utility of taking access in the market so that they can better weather the storm and the uncertainty that\u2019s in the market itself. You also saw issuers who are not impacted to the same extent, but they too saw the utility of tapping the market and looking to take themselves to the other side of this moment of volatility and sort of comport themselves and carry their business that way. And I think that\u2019s a reflection of advice we and certainly others have been giving to issuing clients.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKian Abouhossein: Thanks for taking my question. The first question is related to your comments on your global market equities, you mentioned the dislocation in dividends and I was wondering if you could give quantify the impact that it had on your results? And in that context on equities also we clearly hear that a lot of investment banks have been having gamma positions. In that context, I was hoping if its material if you could indicate if that was a positive or negative impact on your results as well?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So what we experienced in equities over the quarter was the negative consequence of the suspension by certain companies of dividends, mostly in Europe and so it had a European tilt to it relative to other geographies. I wouldn\u2019t call this out as being material. I am not in a position to callout the precision of its impact, but I would say that there were certain industries that were subject to kind of an outright suspension of dividends, there were others in the context of the circumstances of the virus that we are unable to convene AGMs and as a consequence could not declare dividend. Obviously, we facilitate client flows that trade and dividends, it\u2019s a bigger business in Europe than elsewhere and the consequence of those suspensions was a negative impact to overall revenue in that business, but nothing that I would call out as being material.\nKian Abouhossein: And in respect to looking at the trends through the quarter basically we are trying to understand a little bit, how is the sales and trading franchise impacted and you clearly mentioned at the beginning that the first half was excellent, the second half was dislocated, but clearly the trading revenues and volumes when you look at the volumes were holding up extremely well. And generally, in a downturn what we see is dry up of volumes which we haven\u2019t really seen. So just from your experience how should we think first of all about the trend line that we saw through the quarter if you can comment on that both on fixed income sales and trading equities? And secondly, how should we think about the trends generally for the industry when we compare to historic levels, where we really see a dry up post a material dislocation or decline in markets?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. Go ahead.\nDavid Solomon: You go ahead.\nStephen Scherr: No, no, I was just going to comment that, I can speak to the trend that we saw in the quarter and David can offer some further comment of what we are seeing in the beginning of the second to the extent that sustains itself. But while David rightly pointed out that the quarter was on one hand January and February and then on the other hand March. In March, we saw very high volumes through our sales and trading businesses and took advantage of that at wider bid offer spreads. I would also point out that and particularly using marquee and some of our electronic platforms we were engaging in very large portfolio trades on behalf of clients. And I think those electronic platforms were busy and were useful, particularly because it\u2019s not just we who are at a work from home posture, but equally clients were. And so these digital platforms across geographies proved to be quite useful and it proved to be a positive consequence to the overall P&L and certainly to the business of sales and trading. To the extent that continues to play forward one could assume you would see the very same phenomenon, but that\u2019s difficult obviously to project.\nDavid Solomon: I don\u2019t have anything really to add. I think we have kind of covered this. The first part of the quarter, things were going well on the trading business as the customer activity of the trading business has accelerated in March and it\u2019s continued to remain just in the first 2 weeks higher than what we would have seen as an average level of activity before the crisis.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I am sorry I wanted to circle back on the provision assumptions, I know you have spoken about it a couple of times, but it\u2019s just so little confusing to me because I am not \u2013 you have referenced sort of what the Goldman Sachs economists think, but it seemed as though you suggested that\u2019s not what was necessarily an input into your own provision assumptions? And then I think David you referenced a recession when advising clients that a recession might go into 2021, but I am not sure whether or not that was the advice to clients or whether that was the input into provisioning? And I think Steven you referenced three scenarios, could you maybe give a little bit more clarity on what those assumptions are? And given that you have both debt securities and loans when we look at the debt securities, should we like add in the mark you took which looks like about a 7% mark on the $17 billion that you laid out as almost like a quasi provision and how we think about it holistically? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Okay. So, Brennan, I am going to start and then I will pass to Steven to talk about the provision stuff, but first, we are mixing certain things. I was asked a question about advice to clients and I am going to be a little bit more specific in my words. We all understand that a recession is two quarters in a row of economic decline. Okay, and if we looked at the Goldman Sachs scenario that would say there would be a recession in the first and second quarter, but we would then have economic growth in the third and fourth quarter that wouldn\u2019t technically be a recession. However, if you are advising clients and you took the Goldman Sachs economic model that said that you only recovered 50% of the output that you lost and the decline in output during the first and second quarter. And so if you are giving someone an advice about how to position the business even though technically we wouldn\u2019t be in a recession as you got to the end of the year in early 2021, we would not have recovered the output that had decline. And so certainly if you are operating a lot of these businesses, it\u2019s still going to feel like you are operating in recession. And so the advice to clients is to think about when you get your business back to where it was and that obviously takes a longer time. That\u2019s client advice. That has nothing to do at all with how we model or think about our provisioning. And I will let Stephen go talk about that a little bit more.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So Brennan, let me just \u2013 let me directly address your question on kind of process and what we go through. So we obviously have an independent risk group that assigns and works with controllers to an economic scenario that serves as a backdrop that influences the direction they take as they look name by name through both the equity and the credit portfolio. And so it is an input it is not a formula if you will that sort of bleeds out a percentage that\u2019s applied to the whole. Each name is reviewed in the portfolio. It\u2019s done by an independent risk group and that independent risk group uses as an input a macroeconomic backdrop that they assemble. There is no question that the Goldman Sachs Research Group is an input to that, but what puts out is not the sole determination. The independent risk group goes about establishing their perspective, their backdrop with that as an input, but not exclusive. And so that gives rise obviously to an environment against which our controllers approach every position in the book and ascribe an appropriate mark or reserve against it. And that\u2019s the process that we take. And the question you asked about the mark on our fair value debt and lending portfolio, I would just draw very big distinction between marks taken on that versus provisions, obviously, very different accounting regime depending upon the nature of the portfolio itself. I would also be very reluctant to try to ascribe a single percentage to the entire book because the duration on that book is very different meaning it runs a gamut. And so you need to be quite careful in the context of how you market. And so I just offer you that detail just to be super clear about the process we run.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thank you for all that color and clarification. Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Quick \u2013 my follow-up being I think can you guys in your discussion with the equities business you flagged growth and balances of equity financing, but I believe Stephen, it was average balance and so given what happened in the quarter, the number might have been skewed. Are you seeing sustained strength in that average balance on the PB side just given some of the de-grossing we hear from some large hedge funds, it seemed to run counter, now you guys might be picking up share in that business. So just hoping to understand how it\u2019s proceeding here in 2Q? Thank you.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So, your observation was the right one, which is average balances were up, end of period was lower and so just to avoid any confusion than that. I would say that there is nothing when we look out over the client base in prime that\u2019s to be called out as any particular category of client was challenged anymore than the other, meaning I think all of them whether it was quants, hedge funds and the like, all kind of were performing without any particular issue to be called out as against one or the other. I would say, it\u2019s a general observation that de-leveraging among that client base was less significant than perhaps one might imagine from the outside looking in, but again no particular issue and this is a business that remains strategically important to us as we continue to go forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Thank you. Good morning, David and Stephen.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nStephen Scherr: Good morning.\nDevin Ryan: I guess first question here on just some of the puts and takes of the move in interest rates and obviously Goldman is going to be less levered to interest rate movements in some of the large banks, but just with the dramatic shift across the curve in the back half of the quarter, just if you can maybe help us think about some of the implications of the move on the model going forward whether it be on funding or revenues and then any other second derivatives, sounds like debt issuance might be one area of the benefits, but anything else we should be thinking about?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So as I\u2019ve said in the past and I sense from your own question, net interest income is roughly 15% of the firm\u2019s overall revenues and so it\u2019s not near the driver that it is for some of the larger big commercial banks. I think that if you look at where rate moves are and where interest rates have come, it probably plays more favorably to us in the context of funding. And I would point out that again apropos the answer I gave to the question on deposits as we continue to shift our funding mix with greater proportionality given to retail deposits and a bigger broader consumer business that will build, it will become less rate reliance. Rates will come down in that regard. And so our expectation is that this will play favorably to us more from a funding point of view than anything else, but it is not a big driver in the overall composition of firm-wide revenue.\nDevin Ryan: Sure. I appreciate that. And then just one on the investment banking outlook, obviously you heard the commentary on the backlog and debt issuance does not have the same lead time as M&A or IPOs for that matter. I am just curious if the expectation is that M&A and equity issuance are going to track the economic recovery, which obviously could be slower here or you are seeing signs of engagement with clients that could suggest maybe a more material snapback recovery as the economy opens back up?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So, Devin I would say a couple of things on that first the engagement level with clients is extremely high, extremely high across the organization. And this is a different kind of recession. We were operating in economy that was really operating quite well with functionally fine and we turned it off with a sudden demand shock and that\u2019s kind of unprecedented and it\u2019s also unprecedented in that or it\u2019s uncertain in exactly how it turns back on and what the path of that is. And so I can see a lot of scenarios as there is a clear understanding of the trajectory of the virus and how the virus is going to affect kind of the reengagement economically of businesses across the economy that there will be an opportunity for more consolidation or some activity in a whole variety of industries that probably wouldn\u2019t have been anticipated had the economy just kept chugging along. So I am not going to predict that. But I would say engagement is high and I could certainly see that if we got to a place where the virus seemed under control and confidence was building, I think that level of engagement could potentially pickup quite quickly.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on the impairment coming back to that, I think you guys told us that we really shouldn\u2019t look from -- on the private equity side, the direction of the public markets they don\u2019t necessarily reflect what\u2019s going on fundamentally with those private equity companies that we will have investment in, can you share with us some metrics we can look to from the outside to take a look at how those marks may move going forward?\nStephen Scherr: Well, it would be hard to get, I mean shy of handing you a sheet which had every company and every industry. It would be hard to do that. I will just come back to the commentary I made before, which is $19 billion of private equity positions, two-thirds of that portfolio in the context of our look and evaluation of their operating performance continued to perform well. Now that doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to the conclusion that they will continue or that number doesn\u2019t come down, but in the quarter, they performed well. About 20% of them were directly impacted by the virus. We saw it in the operations of that business and then the balance obviously has been harvested roughly 15% producing the gains that we saw. And so it\u2019s the EBITDA performance of individual portfolio companies that really lays on and guides the direction that price action is allocated to those names. And so we think that we have invested in companies that have the capability as the going in investment thesis to sort of whether a variety of different economic environments. And I think the portfolio is obviously intended to hold up that well that way, but it\u2019s not immune by any means from broader macroeconomic circumstances and the marks will reflect the sort of assessment of performance as we move through uncertain quarters.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Sigee: Good morning. Thank you. You talked about your willingness to deploy more balance sheets when you see opportunities. I just wondered if you could talk more about what your expectations are for total balance sheet assets expanding further in the next couple of quarters and also risk weighted assets. So I wondered if you could talk about both aspects of that, the volume trends that you expect to see in terms of overall assets, but also the risk weighting inflation that we have seen and whether we need to be ready for more of that looking forward?\nStephen Scherr: No, this is an excellent question. I appreciate you asking it. On one hand as David and I have said now many times on this call, part of the purposeful inflation of balance sheet and by extension risk weighted assets was in the utility of serving our clients and the history of this firm strategically has been for that to happen meaning balance sheet moves, because client demand is there. The counter to that is that from a prudent risk management prospective we set boundaries for ourselves as to sort of what the consequence and tolerable consequence of that should be on capital. And so we are obviously well north of where we would otherwise be invading buffers and so we have got flexibility in that regard and we equally need to be mindful of what the forward calendar maybe with respect to CCAR and SCB on the forward, but it\u2019s in the context of that, that we will be prudent in the expansion of balance sheet and risk-weighted assets mindful of where we think it\u2019s appropriate for us to be from a capital point of view again given the fluid and attending guidepost that the regulatory issues will have for us. And so that push and pull continues, but we feel quite comfortable with where we are and with our ability to continue to put balance sheet in deployment at the service of our clients.\nStephen Scherr: Okay. Since we \u2013 there are no further questions, I would like to take a moment just to thank everybody for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. We obviously wish you all well in the context of this environment. If there are any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather and thank you everyone for joining this morning. First and foremost, all of us at Goldman Sachs hope that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are grappling with an unprecedented global crisis that is putting extraordinary pressure on all society, on families, on small business owners, on large companies, on non-profit organizations, on governments and economies around the world, and of course on the healthcare system. There is no doubt some segments of society, particular our most vulnerable communities and small businesses are suffering more than others. Thankfully there are areas of inspiration. To all of the frontline workers, including doctors, the nurses, the individuals showing up to work everyday to keep our supermarkets, our pharmacies, and our public transportation operating through this crisis, we are extremely grateful to you and we are in awe of your courage and dedication. From where we sit today, it is too early to know the full impact or to predict the specific path to recovery. But I am confident, particularly in light of the decisive and thoughtful actions being taken around the world by the public and private sector that together we will overcome this adversity. Our people have demonstrated time and time again extraordinary resilience and the ability to grow and adapt to change. I am enormously proud of how our colleagues have risen to the occasion in recent weeks. They have been working tirelessly to help our clients navigate the challenging and volatile markets brought about by this pandemic. And as a leadership team, our first priority remains the safety and well-being of all of our Goldman Sachs teammates. To do this, we activated a comprehensive global business continuity plan. This has been an extraordinary effort with exemplary performance from all involved, especially our engineering and operation teams admits the significant increase in market volatility. Over the past months now, we have been operating with approximately 98% of our global employees working remotely, while handling 2x to 3x the normal trading volumes and maintaining very high levels of engagement across all our stakeholders from corporations and institutions to individuals. Across the globe, including our teams in Bengaluru, Warsaw, Dallas and Salt Lake City, we successfully outfitted employees with the necessary technology to work, communicate and engage without interruption. Our smooth transition is a testament to our forward planning, technology capabilities and business resiliency. At a time of reduced market liquidity, our people are working relentlessly to support our clients. This effort includes intensive engagement by our operations team who worked alongside their industry counterparts to clear the extraordinary volumes of trades, sales and margin activity. Throughout these events, the level of cooperation among financial institutions and the dedication and resiliency of our people is inspiring. We are also staying very close to our corporate clients. Over the past few weeks, I have personally spoken to almost 100 CEOs to share best practices, offer advice and often to take advice from them. They face a variety of challenges, including distribution and supply chain disruptions and cash flow uncertainty. Many are working to keep their employees on the payroll despite a significant revenue headwind. I am broadly impressed by the private sector efforts to work together to help our communities navigate this crisis. For our part to help support corporate financing needs, we are proud that in recent weeks we have reopened markets and underwritten a record amount of U.S. dollar investment grade debt for clients. In addition, we have been an active participant in programs announced by the Federal Reserve to support the economy. We are also supporting the flow of capital in international markets. This year, we have led over $15 billion of Fight COVID-19 bonds, including issuances for the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, Austria, France and Indonesia, where proceeds will be used to alleviate the economic and social impacts of the pandemic. During this period, we have also been actively engaged with our individual customers across the wealth spectrum. This is included providing advice, financing, execution and investing opportunities for our PWM and high net worth clients. In consumer banking, it has been providing uninterrupted access to our digital deposits, lending and payments products and continuous service through our call centers, which are now operating virtually. We have also taken important steps to support our consumer banking clients through this challenging time. We were early to announce the COVID-19 customer assistance program in March and we have now extended it to April giving our customers the flexibility to skip a monthly payment without penalty or interest. More broadly over the past 6 weeks, John, Stephen and I have remained in active dialog with central banks, governments and regulators. We commend the rapid, forceful and unprecedented fiscal and regulatory responses designed to ensure liquid and well-functioning capital markets and to provide emerging fee financing to small businesses and individuals that need it most. These actions will undoubtedly help mitigate the demand shocks caused by the virus and speed the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. government along with the ECB, Bank of England and other global central banks have sent a clear message that they will decisively support the broader economy with the global banking system as an active partner. Goldman Sachs, alongside many other financial institutions, is prepared to play our part to help communities and businesses, both small and large, suffering from the economic impact of this devastating health crisis. We are harnessing our resources, experience and network to help where we can. We are working with public and private sector clients to partner on new initiatives with a focus on community assistance and economic support for businesses and serving our clients and customers. For our part, we have taken a number of important steps, including making a $550 million commitment to COVID-19 relief efforts. We will help small business owners weather this challenging time to $500 million for small business loans and $25 million in grants to community development financial institutions who have a long track record of reaching underserved communities and businesses. We have worked with many of these mission-driven lenders for years through our 10,000 small business programs. In addition, we launched a COVID-19 relief fund with $30 million commitment through Goldman Sachs Gives, including a special employee matching grant program to help healthcare workers, families and the most vulnerable populations. Lastly, in response to the well-publicized shortage of equipment for health professionals, we continued to donate supplies to frontline workers who need the most. Across the U.S. and Europe, we have donated 2.5 million surgical masks and 700,000 N95 masks, which we acquired over a number of years following prior epidemics like SARS as a part of our operational risk management efforts. As the situation rapidly evolves, we will continue to adapt our response for supporting the broader financial system, our clients, our people and our communities. More broadly, these are defining times for organizations. Adversity compels us to innovate, to leverage new technologies and to find new ways of thinking and interacting. At Goldman Sachs, we have always prided ourselves of doing that to help our clients succeed and we continue to execute on this commitment as we move forward. With that context, I will turn to the quarter on Page 2 of the earnings presentation to discuss our financial results. In the first quarter, net revenues were $8.7 billion, roughly flat versus a year ago. Net earnings were $1.2 billion resulting in earnings per share of $3.11 and ROE of 5.7% and a return on tangible equity of 6%. The first quarter proved to be two very different operating periods with a solid January and February followed by a challenging and volatile backdrop in March. In both contexts, our franchise businesses performed well. From a client perspective, we maintained our leading position as a strategic advisor to our investment banking clients in period of stress. We delivered solid growth in FICC and equities on high levels of client engagement as we extended balance sheet liquidity to clients during the most volatile markets in March. We continue to advise our wealth management clients and accelerated deposit growth in our digital consumer banking business. In asset management, we saw direct impact from market dislocation as our on-balance sheet equity and debt investments experienced material mark-to-market losses from falling asset prices. We also recognized higher credit losses and bolstered our reserves. Challenges notwithstanding we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with capital ratios above our minimum and robust levels of liquidity. Importantly, our franchise remains strong and we feel well-positioned to deliver best-in-class advice, execution and risk expertise to every client engagement. Turning to the operating environment on Page 3, the financial markets started the year on solid footing fueled by continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment. Our business performed well in both January and February as markets notched new highs driven by client confidence in activity. This backdrop however deteriorated with unprecedented speed in early March as financial markets began to brisance [ph] of the severe risks from the spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the dramatic measures needed to contain it. We witnessed spikes and volatility across most financial assets and global markets. The S&P 500 declined sharply from all-time highs in February and the VIX hit new highs. We also witnessed significant widening of credit spreads in both investment grade and high yield and de-risking from clients across all asset classes. Given our strong financial position, we were able to commit our balance sheet on behalf of clients and support strong volumes across our global market franchise as investors sought to reduce risk exposure. The very high levels of activity demonstrate the strength and scope of our franchise and our ability to serve clients as an important risk intermediary. Looking forward, our economists expect a very significant near-term decline in growth followed by a rebound in the second half of the year when they expect us to get back about 50% of the decline in output that we lose in the first two quarters. More specifically, annualized U.S. GDP is forecasted to decline in excess of 30% in the second quarter before recovering in the third and fourth quarters resulting in an economic contraction of about 6% of the year. This compares to growth expectations of over 2% just a few months ago. There is obviously a wide range of uncertainty around forward projections given the unknown duration of the health crisis. The reality is that none of us know for sure. This is why it is critically important during this difficult period that we maintain a strong financial profile and remain agile and flexible in our service to our clients. Lastly, I'll share a few comments on our Investor Day commitments. While January seems distant under these circumstances, more distant under these circumstances than the ten or so weeks that have passed, the strategic direction we laid out for the firm remains no less compelling. Strengthening our core businesses, expanding in new and adjacent businesses, and operating with greater efficiency, remain ever important to the firm. We established targets that contemplated in normal operating environment. And clearly, this is not a normal operating environment. Yet our targets represent medium and long-term goals, which we still aspire to. Interestingly, this environment has created opportunities for us to accelerate our strategic plans in certain areas. Our transaction banking rollout remains on track and our growth in corporate deposits has exceeded expectations. In our alternatives business, we have accelerated fundraising on a strategic solution fund of meaningful size to help clients take advantage of attractive investment opportunities. In our high net worth business, we completed our re-branding of United Capital, the Goldman Sachs' personal financial management on schedule in March, and our strong growth in consumer deposits continues to underscore the strategic importance of that business. You should expect us to manage through the current environment dynamically with our priorities of serving clients and protecting the long-term value of our franchise. We will adjust our tactical response as appropriate, which may impact the timing, cadence of the size of certain investments. That says our strategic goals remain in place. As we execute, we look forward on updating you \u2013 to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Sure. Thanks, Christian. I will start and Stephen might jump in. We have been \u2013 two parts of your question in my mind, the first is we have been very committed, this management team over the last 18 months, to running the diversified fixed income business at a point in time where the ability to differentiate in the intermediation part of that business was harder. We were in a very low volatility environment for a long period of time. You have seen us stay committed to a diverse business, where in some years some businesses do well, some businesses do poorly, but we really as we have reoriented the client focus of the organization, we believe that a full service platform would, through cycles, payoff for us. We have spent a lot of time really thinking about the way we connect with clients and the way we are servicing clients and trying to make that business over the last year less transaction-oriented and more client-oriented. Those investments based on the feedback we have and data we have having nothing to do with COVID have borne progress over the course of the last year, from a market share perspective both on an objective basis and also from a subjective feedback we are getting from our clients. In this quarter, you saw all people that operate the intermediation businesses benefit from higher volatility and more client activity. I am watching all the reporting of the other banks as you are. We think we benefited meaningfully from that because of the way we have invested in that business and we are well-positioned. How it continues going forward will depend on the environment and what the environment brings. In an environment that continues to have more elevated volatility and more changes in risk patterns for our clients, I think our franchise will continue to benefit. In terms of capital allocation, I think we have got the right amount of capital in that business, but look, you saw the operating leverage in that business when you look at the returns in that business based on how we are operating now. So again, we have always thought about through the cycle. I think our team performed very, very well in this business. I am glad we have stayed in the broad array of businesses given the environment that we are now in, but you will only be able to judge whether we have got the capital right and we stay zealously focused on this as we continue to run through the cycle. But we have no plans to change the capital allocation at the moment, other than to try to accommodate clients we grew risk weighted assets in the business which obviously attracts capital. We will continue to do that if it's attractive and it supports our clients. The only other thing Christian I would add is that we have also been making significant investments in technology platforms to better serve our clients in this business and we saw a real benefit especially with everybody working remote on our technology connectivity and our platforms. And we think that's an investment that has paid off. Sure, Michael. I mean, I will take a stab at talking a little bit about that. First in the investment banking business, the advisory business is always a lag. So we have a backlog of M&A deals that were struck earlier. Many of them will continue to close. That will bring some revenue into the second quarter. But as we go longer and we continue to be in an environment where there is very, very low confidence obviously as you witnessed over the last few weeks, there has been very little new M&A activity that's been initiated. During the time of low confidence, I would expect that to continue. So over time, the velocity of revenue accrual on the M&A side will slow until we get to a period of higher confidence. With respect to the financing side of the investment banking business, you have obviously seen in the last few weeks record levels of investment grade issuance, one record week after another and so debt financing has been very strong. You have seen some equity issuance and certainly with more stability in equity markets or companies are trying to bolster their balance sheet, bolster their liquidity and position themselves to ride out what maybe a longer period of economic contraction. That actually should accrue to our benefit in that business, because I think we are well positioned to capture our fair share of providing that liquidity and financing support. In the trading businesses in the early part of the quarter, we have seen heightened level of activity in the early part of the quarter. There is no guarantee obviously that continues as we go through the quarter, but in the early part of the quarter, we have seen our investing clients continue to be very, very active. I think we are going through a period \u2013 we were going through March period of significant de-risking. We have now been going through a period of repositioning. So our clients have been active. As you point out, it's very hard to say what that's going to look like 2, 3 months from now, but that's the view I give you at the moment. Good morning. So, thanks, Mike. I will start, Stephen might join in, but you are asking a multi-layered question. So on the first part of the question, there is no question that the response, the fiscal and monetary response is going to have a simulative effect, there is no question. When we come out of this and I am not making a prediction of when we will come out of it, but when we come out of it, it will have a stimulative effect versus a scenario where it didn't exist. The question that's so hard to answer and in my conversations with clients on having it constantly, we have to rebuild confidence in people's security and safety around the virus. We can all have economic forecast and we can all talk about the economic consequence of this, but unless people feel safe and secured and confident around the virus, the economic impact will continue in some way, shape or form. That is a very, very hard thing to predict. So I tried to encourage companies that we have talked to and individuals for that matter to hope for the better, but plan for the worst. And so certainly I think if you are trying to prepare for an economic environment, you have to view something that is a slower economic recovery as you come out of this. And look even if you look at the Goldman Sachs scenario was a very steep decline with a sharp increase in the second and third quarter they are still only predicting a 50% recovery of the output that was lost. So, I think for anybody operating a business you have to be planning on an assumption that we are going to be operating in a recession through 2020 into 2021 and you have to plan accordingly. Will the monetary policy and fiscal policy be a benefit to the positive of what that trajectory looks like in the third, fourth quarter and into the first half of next year? Yes, but it's very hard to quantify what that will be, because the uncertainty around the course that the virus will take and how it will affect human behavior is still very uncertain and anyone who is telling you they are sure that it will look like this or they are sure that it will look that, I don't think anybody is sure. And so I think this will be a gradual path. And as we have more information we will be able to better evaluate. What we are trying to do is ensure that in our organization where risk managing and provisioning appropriately as we can based on the information we can looking forward with that kind of a mindset. Look, we are actively \u2013 we are focused on helping our clients across the organization. If you look at investment grade, you take an investment grade which has been very, very obvious and transparent. We picked up significant share over the course of the last four weeks. And so we think we are well-positioned to capture share. We are going to do it with prudent and a long-term view of our client franchise. And so we are long-term investors on our client franchise we always have been. There isn't an institution that does not have to make certain choices around how it allocates its capital at a time like this. We think we are good at that. We think we are nimble. But of course, we are going to lean into our client relationships and take a long-term view. You go ahead. I don't have anything really to add. I think we have kind of covered this. The first part of the quarter, things were going well on the trading business as the customer activity of the trading business has accelerated in March and it's continued to remain just in the first 2 weeks higher than what we would have seen as an average level of activity before the crisis. Okay. So, Brennan, I am going to start and then I will pass to Steven to talk about the provision stuff, but first, we are mixing certain things. I was asked a question about advice to clients and I am going to be a little bit more specific in my words. We all understand that a recession is two quarters in a row of economic decline. Okay, and if we looked at the Goldman Sachs scenario that would say there would be a recession in the first and second quarter, but we would then have economic growth in the third and fourth quarter that wouldn't technically be a recession. However, if you are advising clients and you took the Goldman Sachs economic model that said that you only recovered 50% of the output that you lost and the decline in output during the first and second quarter. And so if you are giving someone an advice about how to position the business even though technically we wouldn't be in a recession as you got to the end of the year in early 2021, we would not have recovered the output that had decline. And so certainly if you are operating a lot of these businesses, it's still going to feel like you are operating in recession. And so the advice to clients is to think about when you get your business back to where it was and that obviously takes a longer time. That's client advice. That has nothing to do at all with how we model or think about our provisioning. And I will let Stephen go talk about that a little bit more. Good morning. Yes. So, Devin I would say a couple of things on that first the engagement level with clients is extremely high, extremely high across the organization. And this is a different kind of recession. We were operating in economy that was really operating quite well with functionally fine and we turned it off with a sudden demand shock and that's kind of unprecedented and it's also unprecedented in that or it's uncertain in exactly how it turns back on and what the path of that is. And so I can see a lot of scenarios as there is a clear understanding of the trajectory of the virus and how the virus is going to affect kind of the reengagement economically of businesses across the economy that there will be an opportunity for more consolidation or some activity in a whole variety of industries that probably wouldn't have been anticipated had the economy just kept chugging along. So I am not going to predict that. But I would say engagement is high and I could certainly see that if we got to a place where the virus seemed under control and confidence was building, I think that level of engagement could potentially pickup quite quickly."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning to you all. Let me begin with our summary results on page 4. During the first quarter, three of our four business segments produced revenue growth in excess of 20% versus the year ago period reflecting the strength of our franchise and the elevated level of activity in March. These results were offset by losses in our asset management business due to the significant decline in the fair value of our long-term investments in equity, debt securities, and loans. We also took a material provision for credit losses in the quarter. Despite the difficult backdrop, our overall revenue levels remained relatively flat versus a year ago, reflecting the diversification of our businesses. Before turning specifically to our results, I want to reflect for a moment on the financial strength of the firm and the U.S. banking system coming into this period of volatility, in terms of capital, liquidity and risk. I also want to provide insight into where Goldman Sachs stands on those metrics as we enter the second quarter. The industry came into this market dislocation with a robust financial position, as the capital levels for large banks, more than doubled over the past decade to approximately $1 trillion. Our capital stands above our minimums, with the reduction in our CET1 ratio during the quarter, a reflection of a very purposeful deployment of balance sheet on behalf of clients. As David noted, our liquidity is very strong, averaging over $240 billion during the quarter and remains at a level higher than that now. Our risk positions remain balanced, controlled, and adequately provisioned for, both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure. Our ability to serve as a principle intermediary of risk, the source of liquidity and a provider of balance sheet, on behalf of clients is rooted in the sound financial footing of the firm and our long history of being a firm that clients turn to in challenging moments. Across Goldman Sachs, our forward planning and risk management practices enabled us to be well prepared. The liquidity and capital buffers we hold are intended for times like these, and we prudently deploy our financial resources to serve our clients during the first quarter. As a function of the regular stress testing that we and the industry have undertaken over the past decade, our liquidity and capital metrics are sized to withstand severely adverse scenarios. During the time of increased market volatility and disruption, our ability to seamlessly serve our clients, while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrates the dedication of our people, the strength of our engineering and our business resiliency in addition to the financial standing of the organization. In short, Goldman Sachs is open for business. Let's turn to our business performance on Page 5 beginning with Investment Banking. Investment Banking produced first quarter net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 25% versus a year ago quarter. First quarter financial advisory revenues of $781 million were down 9% sequentially and down 11% versus last year amid fewer deal closings, consistent with lower industry volumes. During the quarter, we participated in nearly $250 billion of announced transactions and closed 68 deals for nearly $200 billion of deal volume. We maintained our number one position in both announced and completed M&A league table rankings. We continue to engage with clients about significant changes in the economic environment and the implications for the M&A business. Given the new set of challenges facing a variety of industries, we expect client demand to evolve as they seek our assistance, bolstering balance sheets, hedging market and financial risks, and capturing strategic opportunities. While there are clearly some industries that are more directly impacted than others, dialogs with clients are at elevated levels across all verticals, as this crisis impacts clients of all types and in all regions. Moving to underwriting, equity underwriting net revenues of $378 million were flat versus the fourth quarter and up 44% versus a slow period for IPOs in the first quarter of last year. For the quarter, we ranked number two globally in equity underwriting, with $12 billion in volume across 80 transactions, as we executed a number of key IPOs during the first two months of the quarter. Additionally, following the market pullback, we helped a number of clients raise capital in the convertible market through public and private transactions. Notably, we led a number of high-profile-type issuances for a variety of companies, including Wayfair and Twitter. Turning to debt underwriting, net revenues were $583 million, down 3% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% from a year ago. Activity this quarter reflected growth in asset-backed and leverage finance activity. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our Number 4 global debt underwriting league table ranking and our ability to provide clients access to the investment grade and below investment grade markets, even through the challenging environment in March. As David mentioned, in the last two full weeks of March, we saw record U.S. dollar investment grade issuance with over $170 billion of activity. Of that, Goldman Sachs helped raise nearly $75 billion of financing for clients, capturing over 13% share, roughly double versus last year, evidencing our client engagement and commitment to market access. Helping clients access public market financing windows also enabled us to better risk manage our portfolio of acquisition finance commitments, as certain bridge in other facilities were taken out in permanent financings in the capital markets. Our investment banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter but rose versus a year ago. Given the environment, we expect announcement timelines on several larger transactions in our backlog to be delayed. That said, we maintain active dialogs with clients across our global franchise and know that market conditions can evolve quickly. Revenues from corporate lending were $442 million, nearly double the fourth quarter and up over three-fold versus a year ago, driven by approximately $375 million of hedge gains relating to our relationship lending book on wider credit spreads during the quarter. We maintain single-name hedges on certain larger commitments as a prudent risk management tool. The hedge gains could, of course, reverse in future quarters should credit spreads tighten. As a reminder, corporate lending includes middle-market lending, relationship lending and acquisition financing. In the quarter, gains on single-name and index hedges as well as net interest income on the portfolio more than offset fair value marks on our acquisition financing commitments. During the quarter, we saw approximately $19 billion of corporate commitment draw-downs in relationship lending as we supported our clients' liquidity needs during this difficult time. While we saw a higher percentage of draw-downs from our non-investment grade clients, given the larger size of our investment grade book, the $19 billion was roughly evenly split on a notional basis between investment grade and non-investment grade. These draws were within our expectations for a stress scenario and were below the amount pre-funded in our liquidity pool. During this period, we also saw significant inflows in commercial deposit accounts tied to our new transaction banking platform. These deposit balances totaled $9 billion and we're now serving over 80 clients, reflecting the early diversification benefits of our new business growth strategy. Moving to Global Markets on Page 6, net revenues were $5.2 billion in the first quarter, up 48% sequentially and up 28% versus last year. Growth was driven by significantly higher client activity amid wider bid-ask spreads and solid risk management in a challenging market. As we noted at our Investor Day, our results in global markets, like all segments, include fully allocated costs. As such, our reported quarterly results in global markets were burdened by a charge of approximately $500 million related to valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with widening of credit and funding spreads. FICC net revenues were $3 billion, up 68% sequentially and up 33% year-over-year. Growth versus last year was driven by an 18% increase in financing and 36% growth in intermediation revenues. Within FICC intermediation, we saw elevated client flows across all of our businesses, with four out of five business lines posting higher first quarter net revenues versus last year; again, reflecting the value of our standing commitment to a diversified FICC franchise. In currencies, we saw a very active quarter with meaningful revenue improvement as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume and strong performance in the Americas and Asia. We continued to on-board new clients to our Marquee and eFX platforms during the quarter, and produced record results in this business, reflecting our significant investments in recent years, changing client workflows, and our willingness to provide liquidity during market stress. Our rates franchise also performed well, given high levels of client intermediation and despite the challenge of managing risk positions through a significant jump in volatility as central banks around the world cut rates and the Fed and ECB launched significant quantitative easing programs. In commodities, our business delivered strong results in oil, as we worked with our clients to manage extraordinary price volatility. We also generated solid performance in metals. These positive results were partly offset by CVA from wider counterparty credit spreads. In credit, our performance was solid across our global franchise. We benefited from significantly higher client activity in more liquid index CDS products and notably in client portfolio trades, which more than offset the impact of wider credit spreads amid lower liquidity in cash product trading inventory. Like in our currencies business, our technology platforms in credit enabled us to serve clients in period of market dislocation with both buyers and sellers benefiting from our global franchise, capital commitment, and the efficiency of our digital platforms. In mortgages, net revenues fell, as significantly higher client activity was offset by wider spreads impacting our inventory, particularly in agencies, as we saw de-leveraging across the market. Importantly, our performance was cushioned by the capital and risk reduction measures we executed over the past several years. Lastly in FICC financing, we saw a considerable strength in our repo business as we helped clients navigate dislocated funding markets, which have begun to normalize in recent weeks. Turning to equities, on Page 7, net revenues for the first quarter were $2.2 billion, up 28% versus the fourth quarter and up 22% versus a year ago. Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.5 billion rose 32% versus a year ago aided by derivatives given higher equity market volatility and significantly higher client volumes. This was partially offset by a more difficult market making backdrop in Europe, given unexpected dividend cuts. Equities financing revenues of $666 million rose 4% year-over-year, driven by higher average quarterly, prime client balances. Moving to asset management on Page 8, collectively, our asset management activities produced negative net revenues of $96 million in the first quarter, first quarter management and other fees totaled $640 million, up 5% versus a year ago, driven by higher client assets under supervision. Incentive fees increased to $154 million driven primarily by asset harvesting, including closing a key Special Purpose Acquisition Company or SPAC transaction. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by marks on our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Losses here reflect the sharp market declines during the quarter, given the majority of our assets in this segment are accounted for at fair value. Our equity investments produced $22 million of net losses in the first quarter as material gains generated on the pending or close sale of certain investments in January and February were more than offset by broader markdowns on our public and private equity holdings in March. More specifically on our $19 billion private equity portfolio, we generated gains of approximately $775 million from event driven items including agreements to sell our investment in a UK student housing portfolio and our investment in AirTrunk, a datacenter in Australia. Gains from these dispositions were offset by approximately $500 million of marks on our private equity positions, reflecting the underlying operating performance of the businesses and roughly $500 million of marks on our $2 billion public equity portfolio including $180 million loss on Avantor and significantly smaller losses across the broader portfolio. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were a negative $868 million attributable to mark to market losses on debt securities and fair value loans. As shown on Page 9, this segment houses a $29 billion credit portfolio including $13 billion of fair value debt securities and $16 billion of corporate and real estate loans, of which $4 billion are held at fair value. This portfolio includes a range of investing activities executed by our private credit group and multi-strategy investing teams, which have historically generated solid contributions to firm performance over many years. That said, in the first quarter, the fair market value component of the portfolio managed by these teams incurred significant credit spread widening which more than offset the ongoing net interest income from the portfolio itself. This drove significant losses across the portfolio of senior and mezzanine corporate loans and our broader portfolio of liquid corporate debt securities. As we go forward, we will continue to risk manage the credit portfolio, prudently. With respect to loans, while the majority of the portfolio is non-investment grade by design, it is well structured and over 85% is secured. We also would note that if spreads retrace, as they have in the first part of the second quarter, we could recoup a portion of the first quarter's losses. But of course, there is no assurance of that outcome. Turning to Consumer and Wealth Management on Page 10, we produced $1.5 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 6% versus the fourth quarter and up 21% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, increased transaction volumes and incentive fees and higher consumer banking revenues from deposits and lending products. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $959 million rose 21% versus last year, reflecting both organic growth and the United Capital acquisition. Assets under supervision rose 6% versus the prior year to $509 billion. We also saw higher incentive fees, while private banking and lending revenues declined. Consumer banking revenues were $282 million in the first quarter, rising nearly 40% versus last year, reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and credit card loan balances. Consumer deposits at quarter end totaled $72 billion across the U.S. and UK reflecting a record $12 billion of quarterly growth in the consumer platform. Performance in March was solid with $4 billion of monthly growth, providing a valuable source of funding to the firm. Funded consumer loan balances remained stable at $7 billion of which $5 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $2 billion from credit card. Going forward, we expect to see a more modest level of growth in both Marcus unsecured loans and Apple Card as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation. Now let's turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide assets under supervision. Total client assets for which we earn a management fee, including those in asset management and consumer and wealth management, totaled $1.8 trillion in the first quarter, down $41 billion versus the fourth quarter, but up $219 billion versus a year ago. Our sequential decline was driven by $114 billion of market depreciation offset by $72 billion of liquidity and $1 billion of long-term inflows. Switching gears on Page 12, let's address net interest income and our lending portfolio. Total firm-wide net interest income was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, up 23% sequentially, reflected in global markets and consumer given the impact of lower funding costs and continued deposit growth. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $128 billion, up $19 billion sequentially driven primarily by funded commercial revolvers in investment banking as I noted earlier. Our provision for credit losses in the first quarter was $937 million, up $600 million versus last quarter. During the quarter, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $131 million resulting in a net charge-off ratio of 0.5%. On the wholesale portfolio, we took impairments and bolstered our reserves, particularly for loans in the oil and gas sector given recent price declines. In our consumer portfolio, provisions related to markets were higher versus last quarter due primarily to CECL reserve rates even though realized net charge-offs declined. Additionally, we note out provisions during the quarter were impacted by higher levels of reserving for new loan growth under CECL which we adopted as planned. At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses stood at $3.2 billion. Our allowance for funded loans under accrual accounting was 2.5%. Overall, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations given the recent economic deterioration. That said we continued to monitor the portfolio and brought our risk factors closely and will take any and all mitigating actions as appropriate. One area of particular focus is our lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector. At the end of March, we had approximately $14 billion of total lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector, net of roughly $600 million of hedges. Approximately $4 billion were funded loans. Our total exposure is diversified, with no single counterparty over $500 million before hedges just over half is non-investment grade of which over 70% is secured. And as a proportion of our overall wholesale credit book, our oil and gas exposure remains very manageable. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.5 billion increased 10% versus last year driven by significantly higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees attributable to higher client activity. Higher provisions for litigation and an increase in expenses related to real estate consolidated investments, including impairments. Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources consistent with our historical focus on expense discipline and the emphasis on cost control at Investor Day we will assess the timing, magnitude and pace of certain expenses and investments. Importantly, we continue to pursue our medium-term efficiency target. To that end, we expect to realize the effect of planned reductions in non-compensation expenses more significantly through the back half of the year. Finally on taxes, our reported tax rate was 10% for the first quarter. Our lower rate reflected the impact of share-based compensation awards and the lower impact or \u2013 and the impact of lower pre-tax earnings on permanent benefits. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21%. Turning to select balance sheet data, on Slide 14, let me begin with capital. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.5% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 80 basis points sequentially driven by balance sheet and RWA growth in light of our meaningful client engagement during the quarter. Our ratio under the advanced approach decreased by 140 basis points to 12.3%, with the incremental decline versus standardized due to higher credit spread volatility. Our SLR was 5.9%, down 30 basis points sequentially also on balance sheet deployment to clients. This quarter, we returned a total of $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases notably at the beginning of the quarter and common stock dividends. Our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of 356 million shares. As you will recall, Goldman Sachs and members of the Financial Services Forum voluntarily decided to temporarily suspend buybacks through the second quarter of 2020. This pause allows us to continue to deploy our resources to support our clients in the context of the current operating environment. We remain committed to allocating capital to accretive high return opportunities and when not deployed returning excess to shareholders. As it relates to our dividend, given our continued earnings generation and solid capital position, we feel comfortable maintaining our dividend. Further to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, up 10% versus last quarter. We maintained strong liquidity levels. As referenced earlier, our global core liquid assets averaged a record $243 billion, up $6 billion versus the fourth quarter. On the liability side, our total deposits increased to $220 billion, up $30 billion versus last quarter with strong flows through our Marcus and transaction banking channels. As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy to remix our liabilities to our deposits. Our total unsecured long-term borrowings were $226 billion driven by $15.7 billion of vanilla debt issuance during the quarter as we accelerated issuance into the first quarter from what was intended for the back part of this year to better position ourselves to be in the service of our clients. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflected the volatile operating environment and our ability to navigate turbulent markets and support our client franchise. As we look toward the balance of the year, we take strength from our robust financial position, including capital and liquidity. Our client franchise remains strong and with the ongoing dedication of the talented professionals of Goldman Sachs, we will marshal the full resources of the firm to serve our clients during this unprecedented time. With that, thank you again for dialing in and we will now open the line for questions. Sure, Glenn. Thank you. So as you know, the provision for credit loss we took was $937 million, about $686 million of that were in provisions and about $200 million of that related to the relationship loan book with the balance really guided by the crisis relating to COVID and growth in the overall portfolio. In answering your question, I will point out what we did in this quarter, because I think it will reflect a process that we will continue to look at which is we weigh a variety of macroeconomic scenarios, one that's optimistic, a base case and one that's downside in a quarter in which we sat and if circumstances played we heavily weighted a downside scenario that doesn't rely exclusively on our economist, but takes a broad look. And obviously, we don't know what the forward holds in the quarter. And so I think we will hone to the very same process we did, which is looking at a variety of scenarios, putting enough weight on a downside or a base case, or for that matter, one that's marginally more optimistic. It's worth pointing out that in these scenarios we take a look at what the contraction of GDP is. We look at unemployment, but we don't ignore the fact that there are a number of programs in place across a range of countries notably the U.S. where central banks and treasuries have put in place monitoring fiscal stimulus that has the potential to serve as some counterbalance, if you will, to what may play to the extent that holds and that accelerates a recovery. I have every expectation that reserves would reflect it if this continued on and that didn't have the efficacy that is otherwise intended one could imagine a scenario that plays more to the downside and I would expect provisions and losses to reflect the same. And so again hard to predict what the next quarter or subsequent quarters hold, but I think will rely and you should know that will rely on a pretty robust modeling exercise that will reflect to circumstances that we see in front of us. No, not a problem. So, let me give you kind of quick decomposition and I will start with equity. So we have a $21 billion equity portfolio, $19 billion of that is in private, $2 billion of that is in the public space. When you look at the P&L around it, I would say that on the positive side we realized about $775 million of gain principally generated around the harvesting of assets one as I mentioned being the UK housing platform and the other being the AirTrunk asset in Australia. So that generated positive revenues of $775 million. Also embedded in this was a $200 million revenue pickup in the context of CIEs that we keep independent of the equity portfolio. So think of that portfolio generating positive $1 billion or so. That was offset by both public and private mark. So in the public realm, we took down about $500 million of loss most notable within that was a $180 million of Avantor. On the $500 million of losses in the balance of the private portfolio that was spread across about 280 names. And so it's important just to understand that dispersion. I would also say that when you look at the private portfolio, you don't hone exclusively to kind of public market comparables, you look at the underlying performance of those businesses. And just to give you a little bit of insight into that, of that private portfolio, I would say 65% of it continued to perform well in the context of operating performance in the business, about 20% of that portfolio was impacted by COVID and was the source of a considerable number of the private marks taken and then 15% of portfolio was what's on positive gains in the harvesting that was there. Just to give you a breakdown and the reliance on underlying performance and/or events and not the exclusive reliance on a public sort of analog in terms of looking at that private portfolio. Let me turn now to answer your question on the debt side. So there it's a $29 billion portfolio, about $17 billion of that is fair value. So debt securities about $13 billion, loans about $4 billion, the balance of $12 billion are loans on an accrual basis. And so as you can imagine, the mark-to-market on the fair value was largely influenced by dramatic spread widening that was experienced in the quarter. We saw high yield spreads in the U.S. gap out by about 375 basis points, the same in Europe gapped out by about 435 basis points. Now as I noted, we have seen some retrenchment of that in the beginning part of the second quarter that doesn't do anybody any good as it related to marks taken in the first quarter, but just to give you a sense of the markets retrenchment as we began early. Now we will see what the rest of the quarter holds, but that just gives you a sense of balance in the context of both the acuity and the credit portfolio. Christian, good morning. Couple of things I would add to David's answer, first to his point on capital allocation, it's bearing note as we report now in ways we hadn't before that FICC produced an ROE of 19.7%. And the reflection of the nimbleness and agility of capital, which was a topic discussed at our Investor Day is the ability to deploy capital where it's required and needed by our clients. And that's the way balance sheet flows in and around the firm and within the firm in terms of capital allocation. I'd also point out that I think this business benefited and you heard us talk about this over the preceding one or two earnings calls where we took risk down generally speaking within this business. And so as a consequence, we came into this crisis with a more manageable risk profile and we are able to manage flows and be in the service of intermediating clients more thoroughly. I should point out as I may have misspoken, but growth markets producing ROE as a segment of 19.7%, but obviously FICC a big contributor to it in the context of our overall performance. So Christian, I will take that question. Look the abiding proposition for us obviously is to maintain appropriate risk management and equally be mindful of capital and liquidity and so taking those three as kind of the abiding governors. I have every expectation that the firm will continue both aggressively and offensively to extend credit in the interest of clients across a range of our businesses and equally to meet our client needs in the context of corporate draw-downs or other liquidity needs of the client itself. The book obviously stands at $128 billion. There was meaningful growth in the quarter occasioned by the relationship loan book being drawn by about $19 billion. But I think risk is obviously an important governor. And so I would just point out as an example in the context of the consumer book wherever committed to that business, but at this moment, in this environment we will be quite cautious in terms of credit extension and growing that book and will return to grow that book once this sort of circumstance and market volatility passes just as an example of how risk needs to be the governor in the context of managing this profile and the loan book overall. Sure. So the philosophy that we brought and the accounting rigor we brought to marking our private portfolio frankly has not at all changed this quarter relative to what it has been historically. Meaning, we always look at events that play out as a reference point against which names or companies in which there has been an event either a sale or another investment into that name we market in that context, where there is in an event, we look at the underlying performance in the business in just the way I described we did it this way. And so underlying \u2013 the underlying performance of those businesses is having the true north in the way in which we look to mark that portfolio. Now as we look forward to the extent that we come into a quarter or multiple quarters, which ultimately weigh on the underlying performance and the underlying profitability of that portfolio company or set of companies, you are obviously then could be further marks and loss occasion by that and that would therefore be a lag. But I just want to layout the methodology we use in the context of how we market and equally point out that this quarter is no different than any other in the way in which we mark that book. Sure. Thank you, Steve. So let me start with sort of strategy around rate. We took our rate down actually yesterday in the U.S. relative to where it had been. Our strategy remains unchanged in that regard, which is we aim to be certainly not the top rate payer, but somewhere in the 3 or 4 category and we will continue to do that with an eye towards building out greater product attributes and a more formidable relationship with depositors such that we rely less on rate in the context of both drawing and maintaining deposits, but it's against that strategy that we saw at least for us record inflows on the deposit side. In terms of the medium-term target which we set out in Investor Day of achieving $1 billion of savings occasioned by the migration of our funding mix, that's no less an imperative for us now than it was then. And I would simply point out that the market will pull some volatility into the measurement. So again, this is a medium-term target that we will achieve. We will move closer and closer to 50% of our funding in deposits, the amount or the delta of savings, if you will, will be both a function of where we take deposit rates and as much as where wholesale funding obviously takes itself. And I think particularly in this market and most notably in March, this was a really good very stable source of funding for us, but I think the forward trajectory both as a strategy and then equally as it relates to our ability to harvest the kind of savings that we have talked about over the medium term is one that we are going to continue to adhere to and watch and achieve. So there is no change relating to our medium-term target of achieving $1.3 billion. Now the early pace of that during this period of pandemic will obviously be slower, but this is a medium term or 3-year target and I think we will come out of this experience leaving clearer view as to sort of where changes can be made and where we can harvest expense reduction. In the near-term I am very much minded to achieve flat non-comp expense relative to where we were, but let me just be open and point to the variables. One is obviously, BC&E this is a variable expense that obviously plays in the context of market activity. We have seen more of it. And so as a consequence, we have seen more expense in that regard. On consolidated investments, it would have been my preference in a common market for us to have exited more of those consolidated investments and shed ourselves of some of those expenses whether the market permits that to happen over the balance of the year we will have to see. Obviously honing to flat non-comp was ex-litigation so I am just leaving that aside, but the two variables really just to be candid about it are BC&E relative to volumes and CIEs to the extent we can harvest it. Otherwise, we are quite focused on trying to sort of live to a flat non-comp expense year-over-year. Mike, I also would say that as a by-product of advice, if you look at the roster of corporations that have issued into both the investment grade and below investment grade markets what you will find are companies that are in certain industries that have been meaningfully impacted by the virus yet saw the utility of taking access in the market so that they can better weather the storm and the uncertainty that's in the market itself. You also saw issuers who are not impacted to the same extent, but they too saw the utility of tapping the market and looking to take themselves to the other side of this moment of volatility and sort of comport themselves and carry their business that way. And I think that's a reflection of advice we and certainly others have been giving to issuing clients. Sure. So what we experienced in equities over the quarter was the negative consequence of the suspension by certain companies of dividends, mostly in Europe and so it had a European tilt to it relative to other geographies. I wouldn't call this out as being material. I am not in a position to callout the precision of its impact, but I would say that there were certain industries that were subject to kind of an outright suspension of dividends, there were others in the context of the circumstances of the virus that we are unable to convene AGMs and as a consequence could not declare dividend. Obviously, we facilitate client flows that trade and dividends, it's a bigger business in Europe than elsewhere and the consequence of those suspensions was a negative impact to overall revenue in that business, but nothing that I would call out as being material. Sure. Go ahead. No, no, I was just going to comment that, I can speak to the trend that we saw in the quarter and David can offer some further comment of what we are seeing in the beginning of the second to the extent that sustains itself. But while David rightly pointed out that the quarter was on one hand January and February and then on the other hand March. In March, we saw very high volumes through our sales and trading businesses and took advantage of that at wider bid offer spreads. I would also point out that and particularly using marquee and some of our electronic platforms we were engaging in very large portfolio trades on behalf of clients. And I think those electronic platforms were busy and were useful, particularly because it's not just we who are at a work from home posture, but equally clients were. And so these digital platforms across geographies proved to be quite useful and it proved to be a positive consequence to the overall P&L and certainly to the business of sales and trading. To the extent that continues to play forward one could assume you would see the very same phenomenon, but that's difficult obviously to project. Sure. So Brennan, let me just \u2013 let me directly address your question on kind of process and what we go through. So we obviously have an independent risk group that assigns and works with controllers to an economic scenario that serves as a backdrop that influences the direction they take as they look name by name through both the equity and the credit portfolio. And so it is an input it is not a formula if you will that sort of bleeds out a percentage that's applied to the whole. Each name is reviewed in the portfolio. It's done by an independent risk group and that independent risk group uses as an input a macroeconomic backdrop that they assemble. There is no question that the Goldman Sachs Research Group is an input to that, but what puts out is not the sole determination. The independent risk group goes about establishing their perspective, their backdrop with that as an input, but not exclusive. And so that gives rise obviously to an environment against which our controllers approach every position in the book and ascribe an appropriate mark or reserve against it. And that's the process that we take. And the question you asked about the mark on our fair value debt and lending portfolio, I would just draw very big distinction between marks taken on that versus provisions, obviously, very different accounting regime depending upon the nature of the portfolio itself. I would also be very reluctant to try to ascribe a single percentage to the entire book because the duration on that book is very different meaning it runs a gamut. And so you need to be quite careful in the context of how you market. And so I just offer you that detail just to be super clear about the process we run. Sure. So, your observation was the right one, which is average balances were up, end of period was lower and so just to avoid any confusion than that. I would say that there is nothing when we look out over the client base in prime that's to be called out as any particular category of client was challenged anymore than the other, meaning I think all of them whether it was quants, hedge funds and the like, all kind of were performing without any particular issue to be called out as against one or the other. I would say, it's a general observation that de-leveraging among that client base was less significant than perhaps one might imagine from the outside looking in, but again no particular issue and this is a business that remains strategically important to us as we continue to go forward. Good morning. Sure. So as I've said in the past and I sense from your own question, net interest income is roughly 15% of the firm's overall revenues and so it's not near the driver that it is for some of the larger big commercial banks. I think that if you look at where rate moves are and where interest rates have come, it probably plays more favorably to us in the context of funding. And I would point out that again apropos the answer I gave to the question on deposits as we continue to shift our funding mix with greater proportionality given to retail deposits and a bigger broader consumer business that will build, it will become less rate reliance. Rates will come down in that regard. And so our expectation is that this will play favorably to us more from a funding point of view than anything else, but it is not a big driver in the overall composition of firm-wide revenue. Well, it would be hard to get, I mean shy of handing you a sheet which had every company and every industry. It would be hard to do that. I will just come back to the commentary I made before, which is $19 billion of private equity positions, two-thirds of that portfolio in the context of our look and evaluation of their operating performance continued to perform well. Now that doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that they will continue or that number doesn't come down, but in the quarter, they performed well. About 20% of them were directly impacted by the virus. We saw it in the operations of that business and then the balance obviously has been harvested roughly 15% producing the gains that we saw. And so it's the EBITDA performance of individual portfolio companies that really lays on and guides the direction that price action is allocated to those names. And so we think that we have invested in companies that have the capability as the going in investment thesis to sort of whether a variety of different economic environments. And I think the portfolio is obviously intended to hold up that well that way, but it's not immune by any means from broader macroeconomic circumstances and the marks will reflect the sort of assessment of performance as we move through uncertain quarters. No, this is an excellent question. I appreciate you asking it. On one hand as David and I have said now many times on this call, part of the purposeful inflation of balance sheet and by extension risk weighted assets was in the utility of serving our clients and the history of this firm strategically has been for that to happen meaning balance sheet moves, because client demand is there. The counter to that is that from a prudent risk management prospective we set boundaries for ourselves as to sort of what the consequence and tolerable consequence of that should be on capital. And so we are obviously well north of where we would otherwise be invading buffers and so we have got flexibility in that regard and we equally need to be mindful of what the forward calendar maybe with respect to CCAR and SCB on the forward, but it's in the context of that, that we will be prudent in the expansion of balance sheet and risk-weighted assets mindful of where we think it's appropriate for us to be from a capital point of view again given the fluid and attending guidepost that the regulatory issues will have for us. And so that push and pull continues, but we feel quite comfortable with where we are and with our ability to continue to put balance sheet in deployment at the service of our clients. Okay. Since we \u2013 there are no further questions, I would like to take a moment just to thank everybody for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. We obviously wish you all well in the context of this environment. If there are any additional questions that arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 18, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statement and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me now pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Goldman Sachs delivered record results in 2021, and I am extremely pleased with our performance. We generated record full year revenues of $59 billion and record net earnings of $21.6 billion, over 60% greater than the previous all-time high. While our results were supported by healthy operating environment, we delivered the highest annual return among our peer set with an ROE of 23%. Our record annual revenues demonstrate that our client-oriented strategy is working. Investment Banking had an extraordinary year as clients remained incredibly active and turned to Goldman Sachs time and time again for our industry-leading M&A and capital markets advice and execution. In this business, where we have been the dominant M&A adviser over the last 25 years, we produced segment revenues that exceeded the previous record by over $5 billion. In Global Markets, we have set out to make this business more client-oriented and to improve its return profile. We've made great progress, and we now rank in the top 3 with 72 of the top 100 clients, up from 51 in 2019. And we generated a return of 15% for the year. Our Asset Management and Wealth Management business both had record years. We're advancing our strategy to expand our third-party alternatives platform where we are a top 5 alternative asset manager globally. In the last two years, we have raised over $100 billion in commitments against our five-year goal of $150 billion. We are keenly focused on growing this business, and we'll be updating our long-term goals. We are also proud to run the fifth largest active asset manager globally with assets under supervision of a record $2.5 trillion. During the year, we generated a record $130 billion in long-term net inflows across the platform. Despite our strong market position and inflows, we are on a path to grow our Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses further and drive higher fee-related revenues. Finally, I continue to be excited by our creation of the consumer banking platform of the future, where we are enabling over 10 million customers to take control of their financial lives. Last week, we introduced My GM Rewards card, and we look forward to the addition of GreenSky later this quarter and the launch of checking later this year. At our Investor Day in early 2020, we committed to do three things: grow and strengthen our existing businesses; diversify our franchise into new businesses; and operate more efficiently. As shown by today's results, we are delivering on these objectives underpinned by our relentless focus on our clients. Notwithstanding the solid progress we've made to date, we remain committed to driving this organization forward with a keen eye on growth and diversifying our business mix. These efforts will strengthen our ability to elevate the firm's return profile relative to before we took over as a leadership team. As I look ahead, we have great opportunities to grow the firm as we scale our four growth initiatives. We invested in these initiatives with the belief that each of them has the potential to add tens of billions of dollars to our market cap over time. Given it has now been two years since our Investor Day, we plan to address the details of the next phase of our execution next month. Before I turn it over to Denis, let me provide some thoughts on the operating environment. I'll start by saying there continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty. There's no question that the recent surge in Omicron cases contributed to market volatility. However, I'm encouraged by data that shows that Omicron wave is less severe and has already peaked in some countries. Therefore, it is expected to have less of an economic impact. My view is that COVID-19 will be endemic and as a society, we will find a way to live with it, supported by the efficacy of vaccines and new treatments. For our firm, this means being flexible and dynamic with our protocols to adapt to this new state of the world while also enabling the majority of our people to be back in the office safely. More broadly, there's no surprise that the recent surge in cases is putting even more pressure on supply chains. Inflation is persisting in many countries, and major central banks are beginning to raise rates. Notably, the Bank of England late last year and the Federal Reserve is now expected by our economists to implement four rate hikes in 2022. Based on my experience, it makes sense to coming out of the recent period of easy monetary policy, inflation may be above trend for some time. And in the near term, inflationary pressures may continue to intensify before they start to decrease. I also believe that we could see more volatility as these easing policies are unwound, which will likely have an impact on economic growth, asset prices and client activity. In such a dynamic environment, I want to reiterate the importance I place on investing in the people of Goldman Sachs. It is their tireless dedication to the firm, to our clients and our culture of collaboration that drove our record performance this year. And I want to take this opportunity to express my profound thanks for all their hard work. It remains a personal priority of mine that we invest in their success. In 2021, we demonstrated this commitment not only through our pay-for-performance approach but also by supporting our people in a variety of other ways, including new benefits and investments in health and safety. We believe these investments are critical components of our people strategy, support our culture, and position us for success in the long term. In conclusion, as I said at the outset, we had a very favorable backdrop in 2021, and we outperformed. But make no mistake, as we move into 2022 with excitement and enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead, we remain committed to executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders in any market environment. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the year and the quarter in more detail.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 2 of our presentation. In the fourth quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.6 billion, net earnings of $3.9 billion and earnings per share of $10.81. This contributed to our record performance for the year across revenues, earnings and EPS. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page 3. Investment Banking delivered outstanding results in 2021, with revenues rising almost 60% versus very strong results last year. In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced its highest quarterly revenues of $3.8 billion. Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were just shy of last quarter's all-time record. We maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A for 2021 as we have for 22 of the past 23 years and participated in over $1.8 trillion of announced transactions during the year, driving a volume market share of 31%. M&A activity remains elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT, industrials and healthcare. We are also optimistic around the forward outlook for M&A with continued strength and corporate confidence, coupled with an accelerated pace of transformation across industries. This is further bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors. In equity underwriting, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number 1 globally for the year with volumes of roughly $140 billion across more than 700 deals, representing volume market share of 10%. In debt underwriting, net revenues were $948 million, with our strong performance supported by record industry leveraged finance volumes as well as solid asset-backed activity. We start the year with an Investment Banking backlog that is significantly higher than where we started 2021, despite record revenues during the year. Moving to Global Markets on page 4. Segment net revenues were $4 billion in the quarter, down 7% year-on-year. Full year revenues of $22 billion rose 4%, driven by an increase in equities, which posted its best annual results since 2008. Equities performance was helped by our continued progress in deepening our relationships with the top 100 clients as well as higher financing revenues, consistent with our growth strategy. Turning to page 5. Our FICC business has generated $1.9 billion of net revenues for the fourth quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was largely the result of significantly lower revenues and rates, products amid lower market-making opportunities as well as in credit, primarily on decreased activity. These declines were partially offset by strong revenues in currencies on solid market-making results and as a divergence in global central bank policies led to higher client activity, particularly in emerging markets. FICC financing revenues of $559 million were up meaningfully year-on-year driven by mortgage lending balances, consistent with our strategy to support the financing needs of clients across the franchise. Total equity revenues of $2.1 billion were down 11% versus solid results in the fourth quarter of 2020 as an increase in equities financing was more than offset by a decline in intermediation. Average balances in prime rose to a new record though financing revenues of $819 million were lower sequentially in the absence of outsized opportunities to extend liquidity to clients, as mentioned last quarter. Equities intermediation revenues fell year-on-year, driven by significantly lower performance in both derivatives and cash amid fewer market-making opportunities. Moving to Asset Management on page 6. Fourth quarter segment revenues were $2.9 billion. And for the full year, Asset Management generated record revenues of $14.9 billion, helped by significant gains in equity investments, particularly in the first half of the year. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $739 million, which were burdened by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. As rates rise in the U.S., we expect the majority of these waivers to cease. Equity investments produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, driven by over $1.3 billion in gains on our $15 billion private investment portfolio and roughly $570 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $500 million of losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Moving ahead to page 8. We show the continued progress in harvesting on-balance sheet equity investments, consistent with our long-term strategy to reduce capital in this segment and increase fee-related earnings. Since we laid out this plan at the beginning of 2020, we have actively harvested positions of $18 billion, which have been partially offset by mark-ups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $6 billion, which include early fund facilitation. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is nearly $10 billion. Additionally, we continue to have line of sight on $1.5 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $1 billion of capital reduction. Moving to page 9. Consumer & Wealth Management produced revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing to record full year revenues of $7.5 billion that rose 25% versus the prior year. In Wealth Management, quarterly management and other fees rose to a record of $1.3 billion, up 5% versus the third quarter and 24% year-on-year, supported by strong client inflows. Private Banking and lending net revenues of $293 million for the quarter contributed to record full year results of $1.1 billion, which were helped by increased loan penetration with our ultra-high net worth clients. Consumer banking revenues were $376 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher credit card loan and deposit balances year-over-year. Sequential results were impacted by higher interest expense on our UK deposits where we raised rates ahead of the Bank of England rate increase. As David mentioned, we now have over 10 million customers across our global consumer platform, up roughly 60% versus last year. And gross loan balances are up by almost 50%. We expect loan growth to continue in 2022, given the pending acquisition of GreenSky and the recent launch of the My GM Rewards card. Page 10 shows the growth in our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees, which is a key component of our forward strategy. As David mentioned, total AUS stands at a record $2.5 trillion, following record long-term net inflows of $130 billion during the year, strengthening our position as a top 5 active asset manager and a top 5 alternative asset manager globally. Firm-wide management and other fees for the fourth quarter rose 14% year-over-year to a record $2 billion, contributing to full year management and other fees of $7.6 billion. Importantly, we've been able to grow these fees at a 9% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This fee income is a key component of our strategy to diversify our business mix and deliver more durable revenues for shareholders. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses, including a greater reliance on deposits and an increase in interest-earning assets. As we've noted previously, our business is modestly asset-sensitive. We expect that higher rates in 2022, along with the continued expansion of interest-earning assets will provide a net benefit to our results. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $158 billion, up $15 billion sequentially and $42 billion for the full year. The growth in our loan book this year primarily reflects higher balances in conservatively structured warehouse lending, where our typical loan to value is 50% and an increase in high-quality wealth management loans. Provision for credit losses of $344 million reflected lending growth during the quarter, primarily in Apple Card, as we expand our consumer business. We expect the provision to grow next year, reflecting increased lending and financing activities across the firm. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.3 billion. For the full year, operating expenses were $32 billion, driving an efficiency ratio of roughly 54%, well below our 60% target, and reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to rewarding top talent in a competitive labor environment. Our full year compensation ratio net of provision of 30% is 200 basis points lower than 2020. Quarterly non-compensation expenses of $4 billion rose year-over-year as we continue to invest across the franchise to accelerate the strategic evolution of the firm. Nearly two-thirds of the increase was driven by higher professional fees, technology spend and market development-related costs. We also incurred $182 million of expenses related to litigation during the quarter. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and nearly $700 million in common stock dividends. We also adopted SACCR in the fourth quarter, which impacted our CET1 ratio by 30 basis points as noted on the last earnings call. Looking ahead, we expect further pressures on our capital position, including the upcoming closing of the NNIP acquisition and other deployment opportunities. Given these headwinds, we currently expect buybacks in the first quarter to be at or around the levels in the fourth quarter. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend to issue materially less benchmark debt for this year versus 2021, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, our solid fourth quarter and record 2021 results reflect the strength of our client franchise and our successful strategic execution as well as the upside inherent in our business model amid a constructive operating environment. As David noted, we look forward to providing you with an update next month with more detail around our strategic objectives and targets. Importantly, our results bolster our confidence that the execution of our strategic plan will diversify our business mix and drive more durable revenues for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hello. I'm trying to ask a question as efficiently as I can, [Technical Difficulty]. So, you know that the 200 basis points of [Technical Difficulty] provision operating leverage, but reviews were amazing. So, [Technical Difficulty] is as we think about comp ratio [Indiscernible] where someday capital markets revenues might actually moderate? And two, non-comp of 12%, how much of that sits around, so people can maybe guess this high level of [structure] (ph) relative to a high level of revenue? Thank you.\nDenis Coleman: Hi, Glenn. Denis here. Thank you very much for the question. I think I understood it. It was regarding compensation and also non-compensation expenses. And as you noted, for the full year, we were able to take the compensation ratio down by over 200 basis points, while still being able to have a level of compensation and benefits that we thought was appropriate in light of the firm's performance, taking into context the competitive environment for talent and also wanted to ensure that we had our team in place ready to continue to serve our clients and continue to execute on our plan as we go forward. To the extent that the environment in 2022 shifts, that compensation model is highly variable, and that is a lever that we can certainly pull to continue to deliver on our targets with respect to efficiency ratio as well as aggregate level of returns. I think, you separately pointed out that non-compensation expenses were up. And those non-compensation expenses were up as we continue to make investments in the firm. Some of the largest drivers of our non-compensation expense in the year were transaction-related activity. That is our largest non-compensation expense. And to the extent that activity were to vary and be different, we would expect those expenses to be different. Other drivers were professional fees and then also technology spend. And these are technology spend, in particular, technology spend and engineering expense is a strategic expense for the firm. That's one area where we expect to continue to invest. But we similarly have a number of levers across our operating expenses that should the environment prove different in 2022, we would look to make adjustments to.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: David, I was hoping you could speak to the tremendous growth that you've seen in trading revenues this year. It's also consumed a fair amount of capital. Standardized RWAs are up about 20% year-on-year. It's clearly been the right call to lean into those trading opportunities, just given the 15% returns generated in Global Markets. But if the industry activity contracts, can you speak to how we should think about the interplay between revenues and allocated capital and whether we should expect some RWA relief as activity normalizes?\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Steve, I'll start and there might be some stuff that Denis adds. But I think the most important thing and you highlighted it and we feel very good about it, and I think it's one of the reasons why we were able to deliver 23% returns for the year is there was a client opportunity and an activity opportunity, and we allocated to it resources including capital and therefore, driving RWAs. In a different environment, if this normalized, we think we have the nimble ability to be reactive and adjust. We've always been relatively nimble in our capital allocation to the business. I think we made the right decision this year and captured a lot of upside and therefore a lot of book value growth. But in an environment where the market opportunity and the client opportunity was different, it would be reflected in changes in our balance sheet position and our RWAs. Listening to the first two questions, I just again highlight, we look through everything. This management team is looking through everything through the lens of the fact that we laid out a strategic plan two years ago to drive higher returns and invest in our businesses, grow certain platforms and run the firm more efficiently. When we had that Investor Day two years ago, none of us could have anticipated the environment that we've lived through over the last two years and particularly the environment this year, which was obviously a significant tailwind for our business. I think we've done a very good job being nimble and capturing the opportunity that existed because of the increase in client activity. But we, in no way see that as a permanent environment that's going to continue at this pace. We continue to be focused on doing exactly what we set out in the Investor Day to deliver higher, more durable returns. We're going to update you on what we think that looks like, but we remain very confident of what we set out at our Investor Day. I think there's more that we can do. And so obviously, if some of the market activity that we saw in 2021 dissipated in 2022, we would change our capital allocation, our RWAs and our expense base accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Solomon: Betsy, we can't hear you.\nManan Gosalia: This is Manan Gosalia on for Betsy Graseck. I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the collaboration you recently announced with AWS? What functionality does that give you on your platform? And do you think that that will drive more wallet share with existing clients, bring in new clients, or is it a combination of the two?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. And we continue to find more ways to migrate certain platforms to the cloud, which gives us more efficiency and ability to connect with our clients and deliver resources to our clients. This partnership with AWS allows us to take our data sets inside Goldman Sachs. And if you think about SecDB and all the trading data sets and information that we have inside. In the old model, clients come to us, we use that data and we give them feedback so they can transact. In the new model, we're allowing an ability for clients to connect directly into that so they can develop directly on that platform with our data sets, which will allow them to think differently about their execution decisions and priorities. There are different things that can happen from that. One, with certain very large clients, we've got direct feedback from those clients that that can improve our wallet share because we're delivering real value to them; and secondarily, we actually think there can be opportunities for people to pay for that as a service, given the size of our data set and the resources that we can deploy.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you. And if I can ask an unrelated follow-up. You had a very strong quarter and year on the M&A advisory side. I know you said the pipeline is still strong across Investment Banking and you have a very positive outlook on M&A. But can you talk about how you expect the environment to evolve as the Fed starts to hike rates and as we get into the back half of the year? And are there any differences in how you see sponsor activity playing out versus strategic activity?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think strategic activity is going to continue to be very high. And one of the things I touched on in my opening comments, we have a very, very interesting macro environment because you have all these supply chain disruptions. And I think those supply chain disruptions are real, having a big effect on business. And so, people are looking for opportunities to strategically accelerate in a changing environment. People are looking for further opportunities for scale. They're looking for further opportunities to consolidate. And that's one of the reasons why the activity levels across our M&A platform are quite active. And so both from a backlog perspective and real-time activity and just getting around with CEOs broadly, we think there's a good tailwind for continued M&A activity. And the uncertainty in the environment interestingly is actually helping that tailwind because it's forcing people to look hard at ways they can strengthen their competitive position. And so I think we have a big reset going on coming out of COVID around supply chains, the way businesses are positioned. And I think that's going to create a significant amount of client activity. Now, when you get back into the latter part of the year, you talk about different economic environments, it's very hard to see that far out. But at the moment, the M&A activity tailwind looks reasonably good.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Just a clarification, you said next month, we'll get an update. Will that be in the form of a brokerage firm conference or a special one-off Goldman Sachs event?\nCarey Halio: Mike, we'll put out a press release in the next couple of weeks with the details, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Then to my questions. I guess, the first question is, conceptually, how do you think about taking the benefits of the higher level of revenues and reinvesting in the business? Certainly, your efficiency ratio improved from 65% to 54% year-over-year. But in the fourth quarter, it backed up quite a bit and more than expected. And so, trying to get a sense for how much you're willing to invest whether it's employees, technology, complete that list at the expense of showing positive operating leverage.\nDavid Solomon: Well, Mike, I appreciate the question. And again, I just want to take you back. We laid out a plan and we set some targets, and we are very confident of our ability to deliver on those targets. And we're going to provide more information based on what we know in the coming months as to how we think we're going forward. But, we're committed to that efficiency ratio target. And I said this clearly in my remarks, in any environment. And so look, this was certainly a very, very interesting year. And I feel very good about the fact that there was an enormous opportunity given client activity for us to capture more of that activity, make some investments around it and deliver really extraordinary returns and really extraordinary book value growth for our shareholders. In a different environment, I'm confident that there are a number of different levers that we can pull in that different environment to continue to deliver on the targets we set and make the firm more durable and continue to grow our returns. And so, we're focused on that. We're not wrapped up in the quarter. We're focused on our 1, 2 and 3-year version, a vision of how we can continue to drive the firm forward. And so I hope that's helpful. But that's the way we're thinking about it. That's what we're focused on. And there was an extraordinary opportunity this year, and we feel like we captured it.\nMike Mayo: And then the tougher question but you're in a better seat to forecast this, how much longer should capital markets stay elevated versus pre-pandemic? And this is a relevant question because you're allocating resources. You said the backlog is close to the record level at the start of last year, but I think the concern is really around the markets businesses. And if you get more volatility, maybe that's good. On the other hand, maybe the best days are behind us. But with higher rates, do you get a lot of money moving in and Goldman Sachs acts as an intermediary? Just how do you think about the ins and outs as it relates to the capital markets levels?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. And look, I don't have a crystal ball, Mike. And so, there certainly could be volatility in activity levels, but I think the important thing is to step back again and think about our franchise. And I harken back to our Investor Day when we talked about our position in Global Markets, and we said we wanted to grow our wallet share. We wanted to increase the scalability of our client franchise. We wanted to be more important to our clients. We've materially grown our wallet share. We've materially increased our position, and there was definitely more client activity last year and this year, and so we were able to capture that. In a more normalized environment, that opportunity might be different, but we think we have the right resources to continue to be a leader and to capture what that puts forward and deliver reasonable returns against our overall package of returns as a firm. I do think that market levels and activity levels, given we're in a very, very unusual macro environment, are going to continue to be reasonable as we start into this year. I'm not going to predict what things look like in the second half of the year or next year, but you've still got a lot of volatility around the pandemic. You've got big changes in supply chain. You've got changes in interest rates. There's a lot going on. And so, we still see clients being relatively active. But what I feel best about is over the last two years, we've been executing on our plan. It strengthened our franchise. It's increased our wallet share. We're in better position with our clients. And so, -- and we've also done a lot from an efficiency perspective in that business. And so, I feel very good about how that business has progressed since we laid out our plan on Investor Day in 2019, and I expect we'll continue to perform well as we move forward from here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.\nKian Abouhossein: The first question is just coming back to the comp ratio. If I ex provisions on the comp ratio, I actually get to 30%, it's actually flat year-on-year. Can you just confirm that? And in context of comp, if I just take a simple calculation of taking comp increase minus staff increase, you're up around 20% year-on-year. And if I compare that to peers looking at nine months or what has been reported so far, it's 10% or less. So just trying to understand your driver to pay more than what we're going to see and what we expect to see from the Street in terms of global peers on the comp side.\nDavid Solomon: Okay. Thank you, Kian. A couple of comments I would make. You referenced the ratio without taking account of the provisions. And you're correct, that's roughly flat at 30% year-over-year. However, we look at paying out compensation on the basis of revenues net of provisions. These provisions are real. And that's the basis on which we set our compensation ratio. And 30% is more than 200 basis points lower than it was last year. It's also the lowest comp ratio in our history. So, we continue to drive that down, drive efficiency on behalf of our clients. You made some reference to changes in headcount. I mean something I would offer you up just by way of a perspective. If you look at the roughly 3,400 incremental heads that we have on headcount on a year-over-year basis, approximately 90% of those heads were located in strategic locations of the firm. Only 10% of those heads in hub locations like New York, London, Hong Kong. So, there's a lot of things going on as we continue to evolve the complexion of our employee base and grow the firm. And as a matter of efficiency and strategic priority in terms of sourcing talent and sort of redundancies around the world, we're very deliberately growing headcount in different places. And obviously, as you can appreciate, the expense associated with headcount varies very much by location. So, that may help you with your numbers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Just curious about the -- some of the different lines in the new businesses, specifically the Consumer & Wealth segment and the corporate lending line. How should we think about rate sensitivity in those lines? Can you give us any kind of parameters around how we would calibrate magnitude given we're likely to see some rate increases here in the coming year?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thank you, Brennan. It's Denis. And look, obviously, recognize we have a different business than some of our large commercial bank peers. But that being said, given our expectation for the rate environment, we see ourselves as remaining modestly asset-sensitive. We are focused on continuing to drive lending, increase our net interest earning assets. So, we would expect a benefit in that environment, in that context. I mean, the other thing I would point out to you, we mentioned in the script that with the first -- or I should say, with the first 25 basis-point rate hike, we would expect to be able to roll off the majority of our fee waivers, our money market funds. And just for context, that total number in 2021 was $565 million.\nBrennan Hawken: Thanks for that, Denis. I appreciate it. Also, if I could just sneak in one more. You guys gave some great color around the non-comp. And clearly, there were some noisy items in the fourth quarter. But, when we think about building out our outlook into 2022 based on what you can see now, it seems like the environment is still solid. You've talked about good backlogs and whatnot, even though they're down a little sequentially, which is understandable. Should we -- is the 4Q backing out the charitable contribution and the litigation charge? Is that the right jumping-off point as we think about 2022, or should we make further adjustments?\nDavid Solomon: Look, so I think as we think about non-compensation expense on the forward and taking all of it in totality and again, all within the framework of our efficiency ratio, our return targets, et cetera, where we sit today, we don't see taking our operating expenses up materially from where they are right now. There will be puts and takes within the portfolio of expenses. And as is an item of consistent focus for the market and certainly for us, one area that you should expect us to continue to invest in is across technology and engineering expense. That number for us this past year was between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and that's a number that you should see us to continue to invest in. But across the balance of the portfolio, we'll make adjustments based on the environment.\nOperator: Your next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: I guess, first question here just on the M&A backdrop. David, I heard your comments loud and clear just around companies looking to kind of improve their strategic position. And so, when we think about, I guess, Goldman Sachs' M&A strategy, your firm has been reasonably active over the past couple of years here. And we are seeing a little bit of a reset in valuations, particularly in the fintech space. So, I know that price isn't the first consideration here. But are there any areas that with more maybe attractive pricing or more reasonable valuations that makes sense to get into through M&A versus organic build?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So, Devin, I appreciate it. And my message here is going to be relatively consistent. We have these areas of the firm, in particular, asset management, wealth management and digital consumer banking platform, where we see real opportunity to expand and grow Goldman Sachs franchise, real opportunity to ultimately diversify the earnings mix and make the firm more durable, more diversified and drive higher returns. In that context, if there are opportunities to accelerate that plan and add on to those businesses or accelerate the growth of those businesses, we'll certainly consider them. But we always consider them with discipline. The lens through which we never think about doing something that was significant or transformative would be extremely high. But you saw this year, we had an opportunity in Asset Management business through NN to really strengthen our position in Europe, open up some additional distribution channels. And we think we made a very smart move in that. So, that's the lens that we're looking at. Are there ways to accelerate some of the growth and the diversification of the firm that are appropriate? When you get to some of the growthy fintech stuff, I think it gets more complicated. What was interesting about GreenSky to us was the merchant network. We were thinking about how we were going to build a merchant network, and we thought it would take a very long time, and this allowed us to build -- to acquire a merchant network at what we thought was a very attractive price, very attractive merchant network. And so, we decided that that was an appropriate way to accelerate that strategy. And so, that's the lens that we're going to look through as we continue to think about ways that we can execute on the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just one question, David, around the consumer strategy. So, you mentioned about being opportunistic, I guess, as things come up. But, when we talk to investors, it doesn't feel like the stock is getting the credit or the relating as you diversify those earnings. One, like do you think the consumer business and the strategy needs to rethink, or are you happy with the progress that you've made, I guess, would be the first part of the question.\nDavid Solomon: So, on the first part of the question, we're very happy with the progress we're making. But again, and I've said this repeatedly, this is something we're building for the long term that we think could be a very, very big business for the firm. We're building it with a lens that we set out return targets for the business, and we're making these investments knowing that we're hugely committed to meet our return targets and move our return targets forward. And this is going to take some time, but we feel like the progress is good. As we said on the call already today, we've grown to 10 million customers. We're expanding the product offering. We have plans to continue to broaden what we're doing, and we feel very, very good about it. I don't think the strategy -- we're very, very clear on what we're doing and how we're doing it. In the short term, I don't expect to get a lot of -- for us to get a lot of credit for it, but we're doing the right thing for the long term for Goldman Sachs and our broad franchise, and we feel very good about the progress that we're making.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Noted. And I guess just one follow-up, Denis, and apologize if this is making you repeated. But just on credit, like do you worry about taking on a lot more credit risk given the loan growth outlook that you talked about as we are probably close to the peak of the cycle in terms of the health of the consumer? Just talk about in terms of credit quality two, three years out, how do you think about it?\nDenis Coleman: So, thank you for the question. We're very focused on credit risk. We're very focused on risk management across all the risk stripes. And while David has highlighted our strategic objectives to grow the firm, drive more recurring durable revenues, more financing and lending activities, there is an attractiveness to the stability and predictability of that but all provided that you remain disciplined on credit. And so, that is something that we take into account as we think about the growth of our various businesses within the consumer business, within the wholesale business. And as we think about extension of credit across other segments of the firm, I would point out, for example, that where we grow in the area of FICC financing, we're doing so with secured structures at reasonable LTVs. As we deploy into the wealth segment, these are high-quality wealth management loans. And so -- and as David just referenced in the consumer sector, one of the things beyond the value of the 10,000 merchants for GreenSky is the high FICO characteristics of the customer base. And so, segment by segment, we're making an effort to grow these types of revenues, grow our balances, but to do so in a credit-sensitive fashion.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: I wanted to follow up on the Global Markets business and how you're thinking about market share gains from here given the levels are bit more -- a little more uncertain at this point. And then also, if you could clarify the fourth quarter sequential decline in the equities trading part given the market backdrop seems to be more constructive than kind of your results.\nDavid Solomon: So, I'll start broadly and Denis will make comment on fourth quarter equities. But again, I'll take you back. We've built our Global Markets business as a client franchise. And that's been something we've been very, very focused on over the last couple of years. As you appropriately point out, Dan, we've materially moved our position with many clients, in a very, very meaningful way. I think there's still upside for us from a wallet and share perspective, looking at the broad client base. But as we look at it going forward, we'll take more sustainable share from what opportunity the market presents. And that's the nature of that business. I think we've shown over a long period of time that we're very, very good at adapting and capturing the upside that exists in that business, but we do it now from a stronger position of strength, both in terms of the nature of our client franchise, the relationships we have with our clients and also the efficiencies we have in that business. And so, we're going to continue to focus on that, and we'll see what environment is put forward as we move forward. But my guess is that this business will continue to be a very large business and probably a more consistent business than the general narrative around the business when you go back and look at it over the course of the last 10 years.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. And maybe just to add some context on the fourth quarter. So looking at the fourth quarter versus third quarter of '21 and also frankly versus fourth quarter of '20, the comparison is such that the performance in the prior periods was really stronger. And when we looked at the fourth quarter of 2021, we didn't have the exact same opportunities to deploy capital as we saw in the third quarter, and some of the market making for us was less attractive on a quarter-over-quarter basis, both versus the third quarter and fourth quarter in '20. But again, stepping back, equities still did deliver its second best performance ever. So from the state of the franchise, the quality of the client dialogue, the investments we've been making and the efficiencies of that business and our focus on growing the financing component of that, that all feels very good to us.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. And also just the only other thing I'd highlight, Dan, on that, just to put it in perspective, our -- and I know everybody wants to focus on the quarter, and that's obviously appropriate, but the markets business was up 4% year-over-year. And when we started the year, nobody believed that the market's business could be up from last year, given the activity level last year and last year's set. So, I think there's some structural things that have gone on that have improved the opportunity for all the participants in that business. I'm not saying it's going to level out at the level it's been in the last two years. But I do think we've sometimes got to step out of the quarter and think about what's going on in bigger bites of time, especially in that business.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: There's obviously been a lot of focus on cost this quarter, this year. But is some of it just catch-up from last year? There's been a number of media reports that Goldman Sachs and other firms showed a lot of restraint last year and were looking to catch up a bit. And I was just double-checking my model. I think your revenues were up over 20% last year, and comp was up only 8%. So, is that part of the equation here that we should just better appreciate?\nDavid Solomon: I think there's a component of that. I mean, I wouldn't -- I'd say there's a component -- where the component of that is most evident is that there is real wage inflation everywhere in the economy, everywhere. And if you talk to any CEO -- and most CEOs obviously run different employee bases than we do, but still at Goldman Sachs, when you look at our 45,000 people around the world, the vast majority of those 45,000 people fall into what you call a more traditional corporate compensation model. And I think there definitely was -- coming out of last year after we went through the compensation process, there were definitely places where I think with hindsight and with the constantly evolving environment of COVID and supply changes, the monetary and fiscal policy environment, what they did to savings rates, et cetera, where there was a real base pressure on what I'd call base kind of compensation and wage levels. And so, that's a component of it, for sure. There's also -- and I think it's got to be put -- when people are looking at it, especially in the fourth quarter, when they're looking at the comp numbers in the fourth quarter and people are doing their modeling, we told everyone that we were going to try to do better at really estimating on a quarter-to-quarter basis where the compensation levels needed to be. And last year, for example, through three quarters, our comp ratio was 36% through three quarters, and then we wound up going to 32% for the year, which made us, I think, don't hold me to this exactly, approximately 24% in the fourth quarter last year. If we had been this year, we obviously moved more aggressively through the year, we were at 31% through three quarters. If we were at 36% like we were last year, the comp ratio in the fourth quarter would have been 7%, and then people would have seen that differently. So, again, we're thinking about the year. We're trying to do what's right for the year all through the lens of our strategy to deliver the appropriate sort of returns in any environment over time. But I think I think the question is right, Matt, that there was a component of a reset given the macro environment that I think is affecting business everywhere. And I think we've done a good job kind of addressing that and taking care of that this year. And so, that's part of our base going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. David, you pointed out in your opening remarks about moving up to the top 3 position with 72 of your top 100 clients. Two-part question, one, can you share with us or elaborate on what was the driver? I mean, where is the success? Is it coming from better execution? Is it coming from using your balance sheet, better relationships? And second, will these reasons that drove you up to 72 from 51 be a real strength in a disruptive market where maybe we have markets down this year and not being up, as you pointed out earlier?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Gerard. And again, this goes back to the One Goldman Sachs strategy and some things we laid out in a very clear fashion a couple of years ago about the way we wanted to evolve the firm. And while there have been parts of our organization, particularly the Investment Banking franchise that have always been extremely client-centric, we didn't feel like in our markets business, we were focused enough on the quality of those relationships. We weren't metricing. And I know a lot of this is going to sound like very basic stuff. We weren't metricing and targeting it appropriately. And there's a lot that we have learned as an organization over time that we thought could apply to the Global Markets business and really improve our position. The move from 51 to I think it's 71 or 72, 72 right now, comes from the execution over the last two years of that strategy. We are actively taking feedback and looking at metrics on our performance against this client base. The feedback is very, very strong from our clients that they see a change in the way we're interacting with them, and that's benefiting our wallet share. I think there's still some upside in that. Moving -- if you're not top 3 from -- with more than 51 of them and now you go to 71, your top 3, well, for some of them, you're number 3, you can still be number2 or number1. And we think the base number of 72 can be higher. You're not going to get to be top 3 with all 100, but we think it can be higher than 72. So, we do think there's still some more upside in that if we continue to execute on a very client-centric strategy. If clients have a good experience with us, if they feel like we're taking their long-term interest at heart in every interaction and everything we do, it improves our activity with them. To the latter part of your question, I do think in any environment, we have a more sustainable franchise, and we will benefit from that. And so, I think we'll continue to benefit from that investment, but more work to do for sure.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe a question on the acquisitions as we get closer to the closing of NNIP and GreenSky, are you feeling better, worse about the strategic synergies? And do you see these deals having any noticeable impact on earnings and returns in the intermediate term, or these are longer-term projects? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: I appreciate the question, Jim. I mean, we absolutely feel we feel just as good about them today as when we decided to do them. I think what I can report is whenever you do something like this, you start planning integration. And we have integration teams on both deals, and the work that we're doing to prepare for integration as these deals come to close is going very well and in sync with what we expected in some places, some upside to what we expected. That said, these are medium to longer term acquisitions. In the short term, there's expense pressure and things that come through the P&L, which obviously we're accounting for as we talk about our return targets. But we feel very good about the medium and longer term contribution that these will make, just as I said earlier, to strengthen and bolster and accelerate these franchises.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas Exane.\nJeremy Sigee: You talked about headwinds to the capital ratio. I just wondered if you could scope for us what -- how big the main ones are, what are the major items and how big they are? And sort of linked to that, how soon would you expect to move back up to a higher pace of share buybacks? Is that a 2Q reality, or is that too soon? Will it take longer?\nDenis Coleman: So, a couple of things I would mention to you as we think about capital ratio. So obviously, ending at -- ending the year at 14.2%, what I was focused on in particular in terms of a discernible headwind is actually the announced but not yet closed acquisition of NNIP. We expect that to close in the beginning part of the second quarter, and that would take sort of 20 basis points of the ratio to address that. And as it relates to sizing up our share buybacks, I mentioned the expectation that for the first quarter, we'd be at or around the level of the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is to ensure that we do have the capacity to support client activity. And having referenced that, our Investment Banking backlog is up significantly year-over-year. And given the outlook for markets where we have a path towards rate normalization, ongoing energy transition, single stock volatility, we see lots of opportunities. We want to make sure we're available to support our clients' strategic objectives. So hopefully, that's helpful context for you.\nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Thanks for accommodating the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on the transaction banking business. It's not one that got much airplay on this call, but it's admittedly tough to ignore the firm-wide deposit growth of 40% year-on-year. And certainly, this business is contributing to that momentum. I was hoping you could speak to the revenue contribution from the business today or in the most recent quarter and the success you're having, specifically in attracting operational deposits from these clients.\nDenis Coleman: Okay. Steve, it's Denis. I'll take that. Thank you for that question. I mean, obviously, transaction banking, 1 of the 4 initiatives that David highlighted and an opportunity from an addressable market perspective that is very, very large and one where we're seeing very good momentum. So, we focused obviously on our tech, on the platform, on the user interface. That's now been well validated by clients coming on board the platform. We have active clients in excess of 350 at this point in time. The deposit growth, as you noted, over $50 billion and ahead of target, feeling very, very good about that. On the last quarter's call, we mentioned that operational and insured deposits as a percentage of core deposits had ticked up over 25%. That's now ticked up over 30%. So again, as David indicated, in terms of metrics and management and targets and the way in which we look to grow and build these strategic businesses, we're trying to provide these benchmarks, which we hold ourselves accountable to make progress time over time. I guess, on the revenue front, we've also made very good progress. So revenues for 2021 are up more than 50% and now north of approximately $225 million for the year. So, across each of the aspects of that build and that business and in light of what we see is a very, very attractive addressable market that leverages our core competency with the corporates, we feel good about the progress to date and on the forward.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: Great. So, since there are no more questions, we'd just like to thank everyone for joining the call. And if additional questions do arise, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. And otherwise, please stay healthy, and we look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Goldman Sachs delivered record results in 2021, and I am extremely pleased with our performance. We generated record full year revenues of $59 billion and record net earnings of $21.6 billion, over 60% greater than the previous all-time high. While our results were supported by healthy operating environment, we delivered the highest annual return among our peer set with an ROE of 23%. Our record annual revenues demonstrate that our client-oriented strategy is working. Investment Banking had an extraordinary year as clients remained incredibly active and turned to Goldman Sachs time and time again for our industry-leading M&A and capital markets advice and execution. In this business, where we have been the dominant M&A adviser over the last 25 years, we produced segment revenues that exceeded the previous record by over $5 billion. In Global Markets, we have set out to make this business more client-oriented and to improve its return profile. We've made great progress, and we now rank in the top 3 with 72 of the top 100 clients, up from 51 in 2019. And we generated a return of 15% for the year. Our Asset Management and Wealth Management business both had record years. We're advancing our strategy to expand our third-party alternatives platform where we are a top 5 alternative asset manager globally. In the last two years, we have raised over $100 billion in commitments against our five-year goal of $150 billion. We are keenly focused on growing this business, and we'll be updating our long-term goals. We are also proud to run the fifth largest active asset manager globally with assets under supervision of a record $2.5 trillion. During the year, we generated a record $130 billion in long-term net inflows across the platform. Despite our strong market position and inflows, we are on a path to grow our Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses further and drive higher fee-related revenues. Finally, I continue to be excited by our creation of the consumer banking platform of the future, where we are enabling over 10 million customers to take control of their financial lives. Last week, we introduced My GM Rewards card, and we look forward to the addition of GreenSky later this quarter and the launch of checking later this year. At our Investor Day in early 2020, we committed to do three things: grow and strengthen our existing businesses; diversify our franchise into new businesses; and operate more efficiently. As shown by today's results, we are delivering on these objectives underpinned by our relentless focus on our clients. Notwithstanding the solid progress we've made to date, we remain committed to driving this organization forward with a keen eye on growth and diversifying our business mix. These efforts will strengthen our ability to elevate the firm's return profile relative to before we took over as a leadership team. As I look ahead, we have great opportunities to grow the firm as we scale our four growth initiatives. We invested in these initiatives with the belief that each of them has the potential to add tens of billions of dollars to our market cap over time. Given it has now been two years since our Investor Day, we plan to address the details of the next phase of our execution next month. Before I turn it over to Denis, let me provide some thoughts on the operating environment. I'll start by saying there continues to be a fair amount of uncertainty. There's no question that the recent surge in Omicron cases contributed to market volatility. However, I'm encouraged by data that shows that Omicron wave is less severe and has already peaked in some countries. Therefore, it is expected to have less of an economic impact. My view is that COVID-19 will be endemic and as a society, we will find a way to live with it, supported by the efficacy of vaccines and new treatments. For our firm, this means being flexible and dynamic with our protocols to adapt to this new state of the world while also enabling the majority of our people to be back in the office safely. More broadly, there's no surprise that the recent surge in cases is putting even more pressure on supply chains. Inflation is persisting in many countries, and major central banks are beginning to raise rates. Notably, the Bank of England late last year and the Federal Reserve is now expected by our economists to implement four rate hikes in 2022. Based on my experience, it makes sense to coming out of the recent period of easy monetary policy, inflation may be above trend for some time. And in the near term, inflationary pressures may continue to intensify before they start to decrease. I also believe that we could see more volatility as these easing policies are unwound, which will likely have an impact on economic growth, asset prices and client activity. In such a dynamic environment, I want to reiterate the importance I place on investing in the people of Goldman Sachs. It is their tireless dedication to the firm, to our clients and our culture of collaboration that drove our record performance this year. And I want to take this opportunity to express my profound thanks for all their hard work. It remains a personal priority of mine that we invest in their success. In 2021, we demonstrated this commitment not only through our pay-for-performance approach but also by supporting our people in a variety of other ways, including new benefits and investments in health and safety. We believe these investments are critical components of our people strategy, support our culture, and position us for success in the long term. In conclusion, as I said at the outset, we had a very favorable backdrop in 2021, and we outperformed. But make no mistake, as we move into 2022 with excitement and enthusiasm for the opportunities ahead, we remain committed to executing on our strategy and delivering for our shareholders in any market environment. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the year and the quarter in more detail. Thanks, Steve, I'll start and there might be some stuff that Denis adds. But I think the most important thing and you highlighted it and we feel very good about it, and I think it's one of the reasons why we were able to deliver 23% returns for the year is there was a client opportunity and an activity opportunity, and we allocated to it resources including capital and therefore, driving RWAs. In a different environment, if this normalized, we think we have the nimble ability to be reactive and adjust. We've always been relatively nimble in our capital allocation to the business. I think we made the right decision this year and captured a lot of upside and therefore a lot of book value growth. But in an environment where the market opportunity and the client opportunity was different, it would be reflected in changes in our balance sheet position and our RWAs. Listening to the first two questions, I just again highlight, we look through everything. This management team is looking through everything through the lens of the fact that we laid out a strategic plan two years ago to drive higher returns and invest in our businesses, grow certain platforms and run the firm more efficiently. When we had that Investor Day two years ago, none of us could have anticipated the environment that we've lived through over the last two years and particularly the environment this year, which was obviously a significant tailwind for our business. I think we've done a very good job being nimble and capturing the opportunity that existed because of the increase in client activity. But we, in no way see that as a permanent environment that's going to continue at this pace. We continue to be focused on doing exactly what we set out in the Investor Day to deliver higher, more durable returns. We're going to update you on what we think that looks like, but we remain very confident of what we set out at our Investor Day. I think there's more that we can do. And so obviously, if some of the market activity that we saw in 2021 dissipated in 2022, we would change our capital allocation, our RWAs and our expense base accordingly. Betsy, we can't hear you. Sure. And we continue to find more ways to migrate certain platforms to the cloud, which gives us more efficiency and ability to connect with our clients and deliver resources to our clients. This partnership with AWS allows us to take our data sets inside Goldman Sachs. And if you think about SecDB and all the trading data sets and information that we have inside. In the old model, clients come to us, we use that data and we give them feedback so they can transact. In the new model, we're allowing an ability for clients to connect directly into that so they can develop directly on that platform with our data sets, which will allow them to think differently about their execution decisions and priorities. There are different things that can happen from that. One, with certain very large clients, we've got direct feedback from those clients that that can improve our wallet share because we're delivering real value to them; and secondarily, we actually think there can be opportunities for people to pay for that as a service, given the size of our data set and the resources that we can deploy. Well, I think strategic activity is going to continue to be very high. And one of the things I touched on in my opening comments, we have a very, very interesting macro environment because you have all these supply chain disruptions. And I think those supply chain disruptions are real, having a big effect on business. And so, people are looking for opportunities to strategically accelerate in a changing environment. People are looking for further opportunities for scale. They're looking for further opportunities to consolidate. And that's one of the reasons why the activity levels across our M&A platform are quite active. And so both from a backlog perspective and real-time activity and just getting around with CEOs broadly, we think there's a good tailwind for continued M&A activity. And the uncertainty in the environment interestingly is actually helping that tailwind because it's forcing people to look hard at ways they can strengthen their competitive position. And so I think we have a big reset going on coming out of COVID around supply chains, the way businesses are positioned. And I think that's going to create a significant amount of client activity. Now, when you get back into the latter part of the year, you talk about different economic environments, it's very hard to see that far out. But at the moment, the M&A activity tailwind looks reasonably good. Well, Mike, I appreciate the question. And again, I just want to take you back. We laid out a plan and we set some targets, and we are very confident of our ability to deliver on those targets. And we're going to provide more information based on what we know in the coming months as to how we think we're going forward. But, we're committed to that efficiency ratio target. And I said this clearly in my remarks, in any environment. And so look, this was certainly a very, very interesting year. And I feel very good about the fact that there was an enormous opportunity given client activity for us to capture more of that activity, make some investments around it and deliver really extraordinary returns and really extraordinary book value growth for our shareholders. In a different environment, I'm confident that there are a number of different levers that we can pull in that different environment to continue to deliver on the targets we set and make the firm more durable and continue to grow our returns. And so, we're focused on that. We're not wrapped up in the quarter. We're focused on our 1, 2 and 3-year version, a vision of how we can continue to drive the firm forward. And so I hope that's helpful. But that's the way we're thinking about it. That's what we're focused on. And there was an extraordinary opportunity this year, and we feel like we captured it. Sure. And look, I don't have a crystal ball, Mike. And so, there certainly could be volatility in activity levels, but I think the important thing is to step back again and think about our franchise. And I harken back to our Investor Day when we talked about our position in Global Markets, and we said we wanted to grow our wallet share. We wanted to increase the scalability of our client franchise. We wanted to be more important to our clients. We've materially grown our wallet share. We've materially increased our position, and there was definitely more client activity last year and this year, and so we were able to capture that. In a more normalized environment, that opportunity might be different, but we think we have the right resources to continue to be a leader and to capture what that puts forward and deliver reasonable returns against our overall package of returns as a firm. I do think that market levels and activity levels, given we're in a very, very unusual macro environment, are going to continue to be reasonable as we start into this year. I'm not going to predict what things look like in the second half of the year or next year, but you've still got a lot of volatility around the pandemic. You've got big changes in supply chain. You've got changes in interest rates. There's a lot going on. And so, we still see clients being relatively active. But what I feel best about is over the last two years, we've been executing on our plan. It strengthened our franchise. It's increased our wallet share. We're in better position with our clients. And so, -- and we've also done a lot from an efficiency perspective in that business. And so, I feel very good about how that business has progressed since we laid out our plan on Investor Day in 2019, and I expect we'll continue to perform well as we move forward from here. Okay. Thank you, Kian. A couple of comments I would make. You referenced the ratio without taking account of the provisions. And you're correct, that's roughly flat at 30% year-over-year. However, we look at paying out compensation on the basis of revenues net of provisions. These provisions are real. And that's the basis on which we set our compensation ratio. And 30% is more than 200 basis points lower than it was last year. It's also the lowest comp ratio in our history. So, we continue to drive that down, drive efficiency on behalf of our clients. You made some reference to changes in headcount. I mean something I would offer you up just by way of a perspective. If you look at the roughly 3,400 incremental heads that we have on headcount on a year-over-year basis, approximately 90% of those heads were located in strategic locations of the firm. Only 10% of those heads in hub locations like New York, London, Hong Kong. So, there's a lot of things going on as we continue to evolve the complexion of our employee base and grow the firm. And as a matter of efficiency and strategic priority in terms of sourcing talent and sort of redundancies around the world, we're very deliberately growing headcount in different places. And obviously, as you can appreciate, the expense associated with headcount varies very much by location. So, that may help you with your numbers. Look, so I think as we think about non-compensation expense on the forward and taking all of it in totality and again, all within the framework of our efficiency ratio, our return targets, et cetera, where we sit today, we don't see taking our operating expenses up materially from where they are right now. There will be puts and takes within the portfolio of expenses. And as is an item of consistent focus for the market and certainly for us, one area that you should expect us to continue to invest in is across technology and engineering expense. That number for us this past year was between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and that's a number that you should see us to continue to invest in. But across the balance of the portfolio, we'll make adjustments based on the environment. Yes. So, Devin, I appreciate it. And my message here is going to be relatively consistent. We have these areas of the firm, in particular, asset management, wealth management and digital consumer banking platform, where we see real opportunity to expand and grow Goldman Sachs franchise, real opportunity to ultimately diversify the earnings mix and make the firm more durable, more diversified and drive higher returns. In that context, if there are opportunities to accelerate that plan and add on to those businesses or accelerate the growth of those businesses, we'll certainly consider them. But we always consider them with discipline. The lens through which we never think about doing something that was significant or transformative would be extremely high. But you saw this year, we had an opportunity in Asset Management business through NN to really strengthen our position in Europe, open up some additional distribution channels. And we think we made a very smart move in that. So, that's the lens that we're looking at. Are there ways to accelerate some of the growth and the diversification of the firm that are appropriate? When you get to some of the growthy fintech stuff, I think it gets more complicated. What was interesting about GreenSky to us was the merchant network. We were thinking about how we were going to build a merchant network, and we thought it would take a very long time, and this allowed us to build -- to acquire a merchant network at what we thought was a very attractive price, very attractive merchant network. And so, we decided that that was an appropriate way to accelerate that strategy. And so, that's the lens that we're going to look through as we continue to think about ways that we can execute on the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. So, on the first part of the question, we're very happy with the progress we're making. But again, and I've said this repeatedly, this is something we're building for the long term that we think could be a very, very big business for the firm. We're building it with a lens that we set out return targets for the business, and we're making these investments knowing that we're hugely committed to meet our return targets and move our return targets forward. And this is going to take some time, but we feel like the progress is good. As we said on the call already today, we've grown to 10 million customers. We're expanding the product offering. We have plans to continue to broaden what we're doing, and we feel very, very good about it. I don't think the strategy -- we're very, very clear on what we're doing and how we're doing it. In the short term, I don't expect to get a lot of -- for us to get a lot of credit for it, but we're doing the right thing for the long term for Goldman Sachs and our broad franchise, and we feel very good about the progress that we're making. So, I'll start broadly and Denis will make comment on fourth quarter equities. But again, I'll take you back. We've built our Global Markets business as a client franchise. And that's been something we've been very, very focused on over the last couple of years. As you appropriately point out, Dan, we've materially moved our position with many clients, in a very, very meaningful way. I think there's still upside for us from a wallet and share perspective, looking at the broad client base. But as we look at it going forward, we'll take more sustainable share from what opportunity the market presents. And that's the nature of that business. I think we've shown over a long period of time that we're very, very good at adapting and capturing the upside that exists in that business, but we do it now from a stronger position of strength, both in terms of the nature of our client franchise, the relationships we have with our clients and also the efficiencies we have in that business. And so, we're going to continue to focus on that, and we'll see what environment is put forward as we move forward. But my guess is that this business will continue to be a very large business and probably a more consistent business than the general narrative around the business when you go back and look at it over the course of the last 10 years. Yes. And also just the only other thing I'd highlight, Dan, on that, just to put it in perspective, our -- and I know everybody wants to focus on the quarter, and that's obviously appropriate, but the markets business was up 4% year-over-year. And when we started the year, nobody believed that the market's business could be up from last year, given the activity level last year and last year's set. So, I think there's some structural things that have gone on that have improved the opportunity for all the participants in that business. I'm not saying it's going to level out at the level it's been in the last two years. But I do think we've sometimes got to step out of the quarter and think about what's going on in bigger bites of time, especially in that business. I think there's a component of that. I mean, I wouldn't -- I'd say there's a component -- where the component of that is most evident is that there is real wage inflation everywhere in the economy, everywhere. And if you talk to any CEO -- and most CEOs obviously run different employee bases than we do, but still at Goldman Sachs, when you look at our 45,000 people around the world, the vast majority of those 45,000 people fall into what you call a more traditional corporate compensation model. And I think there definitely was -- coming out of last year after we went through the compensation process, there were definitely places where I think with hindsight and with the constantly evolving environment of COVID and supply changes, the monetary and fiscal policy environment, what they did to savings rates, et cetera, where there was a real base pressure on what I'd call base kind of compensation and wage levels. And so, that's a component of it, for sure. There's also -- and I think it's got to be put -- when people are looking at it, especially in the fourth quarter, when they're looking at the comp numbers in the fourth quarter and people are doing their modeling, we told everyone that we were going to try to do better at really estimating on a quarter-to-quarter basis where the compensation levels needed to be. And last year, for example, through three quarters, our comp ratio was 36% through three quarters, and then we wound up going to 32% for the year, which made us, I think, don't hold me to this exactly, approximately 24% in the fourth quarter last year. If we had been this year, we obviously moved more aggressively through the year, we were at 31% through three quarters. If we were at 36% like we were last year, the comp ratio in the fourth quarter would have been 7%, and then people would have seen that differently. So, again, we're thinking about the year. We're trying to do what's right for the year all through the lens of our strategy to deliver the appropriate sort of returns in any environment over time. But I think I think the question is right, Matt, that there was a component of a reset given the macro environment that I think is affecting business everywhere. And I think we've done a good job kind of addressing that and taking care of that this year. And so, that's part of our base going forward. Yes. So, thanks for the question, Gerard. And again, this goes back to the One Goldman Sachs strategy and some things we laid out in a very clear fashion a couple of years ago about the way we wanted to evolve the firm. And while there have been parts of our organization, particularly the Investment Banking franchise that have always been extremely client-centric, we didn't feel like in our markets business, we were focused enough on the quality of those relationships. We weren't metricing. And I know a lot of this is going to sound like very basic stuff. We weren't metricing and targeting it appropriately. And there's a lot that we have learned as an organization over time that we thought could apply to the Global Markets business and really improve our position. The move from 51 to I think it's 71 or 72, 72 right now, comes from the execution over the last two years of that strategy. We are actively taking feedback and looking at metrics on our performance against this client base. The feedback is very, very strong from our clients that they see a change in the way we're interacting with them, and that's benefiting our wallet share. I think there's still some upside in that. Moving -- if you're not top 3 from -- with more than 51 of them and now you go to 71, your top 3, well, for some of them, you're number 3, you can still be number2 or number1. And we think the base number of 72 can be higher. You're not going to get to be top 3 with all 100, but we think it can be higher than 72. So, we do think there's still some more upside in that if we continue to execute on a very client-centric strategy. If clients have a good experience with us, if they feel like we're taking their long-term interest at heart in every interaction and everything we do, it improves our activity with them. To the latter part of your question, I do think in any environment, we have a more sustainable franchise, and we will benefit from that. And so, I think we'll continue to benefit from that investment, but more work to do for sure. I appreciate the question, Jim. I mean, we absolutely feel we feel just as good about them today as when we decided to do them. I think what I can report is whenever you do something like this, you start planning integration. And we have integration teams on both deals, and the work that we're doing to prepare for integration as these deals come to close is going very well and in sync with what we expected in some places, some upside to what we expected. That said, these are medium to longer term acquisitions. In the short term, there's expense pressure and things that come through the P&L, which obviously we're accounting for as we talk about our return targets. But we feel very good about the medium and longer term contribution that these will make, just as I said earlier, to strengthen and bolster and accelerate these franchises."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 2 of our presentation. In the fourth quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.6 billion, net earnings of $3.9 billion and earnings per share of $10.81. This contributed to our record performance for the year across revenues, earnings and EPS. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page 3. Investment Banking delivered outstanding results in 2021, with revenues rising almost 60% versus very strong results last year. In the fourth quarter, Investment Banking produced its highest quarterly revenues of $3.8 billion. Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were just shy of last quarter's all-time record. We maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A for 2021 as we have for 22 of the past 23 years and participated in over $1.8 trillion of announced transactions during the year, driving a volume market share of 31%. M&A activity remains elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT, industrials and healthcare. We are also optimistic around the forward outlook for M&A with continued strength and corporate confidence, coupled with an accelerated pace of transformation across industries. This is further bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors. In equity underwriting, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number 1 globally for the year with volumes of roughly $140 billion across more than 700 deals, representing volume market share of 10%. In debt underwriting, net revenues were $948 million, with our strong performance supported by record industry leveraged finance volumes as well as solid asset-backed activity. We start the year with an Investment Banking backlog that is significantly higher than where we started 2021, despite record revenues during the year. Moving to Global Markets on page 4. Segment net revenues were $4 billion in the quarter, down 7% year-on-year. Full year revenues of $22 billion rose 4%, driven by an increase in equities, which posted its best annual results since 2008. Equities performance was helped by our continued progress in deepening our relationships with the top 100 clients as well as higher financing revenues, consistent with our growth strategy. Turning to page 5. Our FICC business has generated $1.9 billion of net revenues for the fourth quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was largely the result of significantly lower revenues and rates, products amid lower market-making opportunities as well as in credit, primarily on decreased activity. These declines were partially offset by strong revenues in currencies on solid market-making results and as a divergence in global central bank policies led to higher client activity, particularly in emerging markets. FICC financing revenues of $559 million were up meaningfully year-on-year driven by mortgage lending balances, consistent with our strategy to support the financing needs of clients across the franchise. Total equity revenues of $2.1 billion were down 11% versus solid results in the fourth quarter of 2020 as an increase in equities financing was more than offset by a decline in intermediation. Average balances in prime rose to a new record though financing revenues of $819 million were lower sequentially in the absence of outsized opportunities to extend liquidity to clients, as mentioned last quarter. Equities intermediation revenues fell year-on-year, driven by significantly lower performance in both derivatives and cash amid fewer market-making opportunities. Moving to Asset Management on page 6. Fourth quarter segment revenues were $2.9 billion. And for the full year, Asset Management generated record revenues of $14.9 billion, helped by significant gains in equity investments, particularly in the first half of the year. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $739 million, which were burdened by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. As rates rise in the U.S., we expect the majority of these waivers to cease. Equity investments produced net revenues of $1.4 billion, driven by over $1.3 billion in gains on our $15 billion private investment portfolio and roughly $570 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $500 million of losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Moving ahead to page 8. We show the continued progress in harvesting on-balance sheet equity investments, consistent with our long-term strategy to reduce capital in this segment and increase fee-related earnings. Since we laid out this plan at the beginning of 2020, we have actively harvested positions of $18 billion, which have been partially offset by mark-ups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $6 billion, which include early fund facilitation. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is nearly $10 billion. Additionally, we continue to have line of sight on $1.5 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $1 billion of capital reduction. Moving to page 9. Consumer & Wealth Management produced revenues of $2 billion in the fourth quarter, contributing to record full year revenues of $7.5 billion that rose 25% versus the prior year. In Wealth Management, quarterly management and other fees rose to a record of $1.3 billion, up 5% versus the third quarter and 24% year-on-year, supported by strong client inflows. Private Banking and lending net revenues of $293 million for the quarter contributed to record full year results of $1.1 billion, which were helped by increased loan penetration with our ultra-high net worth clients. Consumer banking revenues were $376 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher credit card loan and deposit balances year-over-year. Sequential results were impacted by higher interest expense on our UK deposits where we raised rates ahead of the Bank of England rate increase. As David mentioned, we now have over 10 million customers across our global consumer platform, up roughly 60% versus last year. And gross loan balances are up by almost 50%. We expect loan growth to continue in 2022, given the pending acquisition of GreenSky and the recent launch of the My GM Rewards card. Page 10 shows the growth in our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees, which is a key component of our forward strategy. As David mentioned, total AUS stands at a record $2.5 trillion, following record long-term net inflows of $130 billion during the year, strengthening our position as a top 5 active asset manager and a top 5 alternative asset manager globally. Firm-wide management and other fees for the fourth quarter rose 14% year-over-year to a record $2 billion, contributing to full year management and other fees of $7.6 billion. Importantly, we've been able to grow these fees at a 9% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This fee income is a key component of our strategy to diversify our business mix and deliver more durable revenues for shareholders. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the fourth quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses, including a greater reliance on deposits and an increase in interest-earning assets. As we've noted previously, our business is modestly asset-sensitive. We expect that higher rates in 2022, along with the continued expansion of interest-earning assets will provide a net benefit to our results. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $158 billion, up $15 billion sequentially and $42 billion for the full year. The growth in our loan book this year primarily reflects higher balances in conservatively structured warehouse lending, where our typical loan to value is 50% and an increase in high-quality wealth management loans. Provision for credit losses of $344 million reflected lending growth during the quarter, primarily in Apple Card, as we expand our consumer business. We expect the provision to grow next year, reflecting increased lending and financing activities across the firm. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.3 billion. For the full year, operating expenses were $32 billion, driving an efficiency ratio of roughly 54%, well below our 60% target, and reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to rewarding top talent in a competitive labor environment. Our full year compensation ratio net of provision of 30% is 200 basis points lower than 2020. Quarterly non-compensation expenses of $4 billion rose year-over-year as we continue to invest across the franchise to accelerate the strategic evolution of the firm. Nearly two-thirds of the increase was driven by higher professional fees, technology spend and market development-related costs. We also incurred $182 million of expenses related to litigation during the quarter. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and nearly $700 million in common stock dividends. We also adopted SACCR in the fourth quarter, which impacted our CET1 ratio by 30 basis points as noted on the last earnings call. Looking ahead, we expect further pressures on our capital position, including the upcoming closing of the NNIP acquisition and other deployment opportunities. Given these headwinds, we currently expect buybacks in the first quarter to be at or around the levels in the fourth quarter. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend to issue materially less benchmark debt for this year versus 2021, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, our solid fourth quarter and record 2021 results reflect the strength of our client franchise and our successful strategic execution as well as the upside inherent in our business model amid a constructive operating environment. As David noted, we look forward to providing you with an update next month with more detail around our strategic objectives and targets. Importantly, our results bolster our confidence that the execution of our strategic plan will diversify our business mix and drive more durable revenues for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Hi, Glenn. Denis here. Thank you very much for the question. I think I understood it. It was regarding compensation and also non-compensation expenses. And as you noted, for the full year, we were able to take the compensation ratio down by over 200 basis points, while still being able to have a level of compensation and benefits that we thought was appropriate in light of the firm's performance, taking into context the competitive environment for talent and also wanted to ensure that we had our team in place ready to continue to serve our clients and continue to execute on our plan as we go forward. To the extent that the environment in 2022 shifts, that compensation model is highly variable, and that is a lever that we can certainly pull to continue to deliver on our targets with respect to efficiency ratio as well as aggregate level of returns. I think, you separately pointed out that non-compensation expenses were up. And those non-compensation expenses were up as we continue to make investments in the firm. Some of the largest drivers of our non-compensation expense in the year were transaction-related activity. That is our largest non-compensation expense. And to the extent that activity were to vary and be different, we would expect those expenses to be different. Other drivers were professional fees and then also technology spend. And these are technology spend, in particular, technology spend and engineering expense is a strategic expense for the firm. That's one area where we expect to continue to invest. But we similarly have a number of levers across our operating expenses that should the environment prove different in 2022, we would look to make adjustments to. Sure. Thank you, Brennan. It's Denis. And look, obviously, recognize we have a different business than some of our large commercial bank peers. But that being said, given our expectation for the rate environment, we see ourselves as remaining modestly asset-sensitive. We are focused on continuing to drive lending, increase our net interest earning assets. So, we would expect a benefit in that environment, in that context. I mean, the other thing I would point out to you, we mentioned in the script that with the first -- or I should say, with the first 25 basis-point rate hike, we would expect to be able to roll off the majority of our fee waivers, our money market funds. And just for context, that total number in 2021 was $565 million. So, thank you for the question. We're very focused on credit risk. We're very focused on risk management across all the risk stripes. And while David has highlighted our strategic objectives to grow the firm, drive more recurring durable revenues, more financing and lending activities, there is an attractiveness to the stability and predictability of that but all provided that you remain disciplined on credit. And so, that is something that we take into account as we think about the growth of our various businesses within the consumer business, within the wholesale business. And as we think about extension of credit across other segments of the firm, I would point out, for example, that where we grow in the area of FICC financing, we're doing so with secured structures at reasonable LTVs. As we deploy into the wealth segment, these are high-quality wealth management loans. And so -- and as David just referenced in the consumer sector, one of the things beyond the value of the 10,000 merchants for GreenSky is the high FICO characteristics of the customer base. And so, segment by segment, we're making an effort to grow these types of revenues, grow our balances, but to do so in a credit-sensitive fashion. Sure. And maybe just to add some context on the fourth quarter. So looking at the fourth quarter versus third quarter of '21 and also frankly versus fourth quarter of '20, the comparison is such that the performance in the prior periods was really stronger. And when we looked at the fourth quarter of 2021, we didn't have the exact same opportunities to deploy capital as we saw in the third quarter, and some of the market making for us was less attractive on a quarter-over-quarter basis, both versus the third quarter and fourth quarter in '20. But again, stepping back, equities still did deliver its second best performance ever. So from the state of the franchise, the quality of the client dialogue, the investments we've been making and the efficiencies of that business and our focus on growing the financing component of that, that all feels very good to us. So, a couple of things I would mention to you as we think about capital ratio. So obviously, ending at -- ending the year at 14.2%, what I was focused on in particular in terms of a discernible headwind is actually the announced but not yet closed acquisition of NNIP. We expect that to close in the beginning part of the second quarter, and that would take sort of 20 basis points of the ratio to address that. And as it relates to sizing up our share buybacks, I mentioned the expectation that for the first quarter, we'd be at or around the level of the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is to ensure that we do have the capacity to support client activity. And having referenced that, our Investment Banking backlog is up significantly year-over-year. And given the outlook for markets where we have a path towards rate normalization, ongoing energy transition, single stock volatility, we see lots of opportunities. We want to make sure we're available to support our clients' strategic objectives. So hopefully, that's helpful context for you. Okay. Steve, it's Denis. I'll take that. Thank you for that question. I mean, obviously, transaction banking, 1 of the 4 initiatives that David highlighted and an opportunity from an addressable market perspective that is very, very large and one where we're seeing very good momentum. So, we focused obviously on our tech, on the platform, on the user interface. That's now been well validated by clients coming on board the platform. We have active clients in excess of 350 at this point in time. The deposit growth, as you noted, over $50 billion and ahead of target, feeling very, very good about that. On the last quarter's call, we mentioned that operational and insured deposits as a percentage of core deposits had ticked up over 25%. That's now ticked up over 30%. So again, as David indicated, in terms of metrics and management and targets and the way in which we look to grow and build these strategic businesses, we're trying to provide these benchmarks, which we hold ourselves accountable to make progress time over time. I guess, on the revenue front, we've also made very good progress. So revenues for 2021 are up more than 50% and now north of approximately $225 million for the year. So, across each of the aspects of that build and that business and in light of what we see is a very, very attractive addressable market that leverages our core competency with the corporates, we feel good about the progress to date and on the forward."

I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr, and our incoming CFO, Dennis Coleman (ph). With that, let me pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. I'm joining you today from California, where we have been hosting one of our best-known client events, the Builders + Innovators Summit. We bring together over a 100 of the most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build successful and enduring companies. I've heard from a number of them that they are extremely excited to meet with our team and with other entrepreneurs here in California. In addition, over the last few months, I've also been able to travel around to spend time with our employees and clients in person, which has been invigorating. In my conversations with clients, and then the results we're reporting today, it's clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing. This quarter, we announced two acquisitions. A key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our Investor Day in 2020, centered around diversifying our business mix towards more recurring revenues and durable earnings. There's no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans. And now, we are further investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution. First, in August, we announced the acquisition of a leading European asset manager, NN Investment Partners. The addition of $320 billion in assets under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our asset management platforms, enhance our distribution network on the continent, and bolster our ESG capabilities. On the topic of ESG, as world leaders prepare to convene in Glasgow later this month for COP26, I would like to underscore the firm's commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth. And we're making progress towards our target of $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity to help achieve these goals. My view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more sustainable future. This includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon. This transition is complex and won't happen overnight. It will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part. And given the fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future, it is critical that we strike a balance between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face. Our second acquisition was GreenSky, which we announced in September. This transaction furthers our efforts to build the consumer banking platform of the future, that provides our consumer business with an attractive and high credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over 10,000 merchants and a secularly growing market, that's a digital cloud-based infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform. And with the addition of our bank funding model, we expect to generate 20%-plus returns at scale for recurring fee-based in net interest income revenues. Importantly, these customers will be our customers. They will live in the market's ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives. Turning to Page 1 of our presentation. We produced net revenues of $13.6 billion, driven by year-on-year increases in three of our four business segments. On the bottom line, we delivered net earnings of $5.4 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $14.93. Our year-to-date revenues of nearly $47 billion and net earnings of over $17.5 billion are higher than any full-year results in our history, and drove an ROE of nearly 26% and an ROT of over 27%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and a supportive market environment. In Investment Banking, we produced our second highest quarterly revenues. Our clients who are extremely active, they turned to Goldman Sachs for our leading M&A franchise, driving strategic activity and associated financing to elevated levels. We delivered solid results in global markets as we continue to focus on market share and engage with clients on a broader array of solutions. In Asset Management, assets under supervision hit another record of $1.7 trillion, which will be further enhanced by the NNIP acquisition. We continue to transition our alternatives business to more third-party funds, and we have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients, raising $90 billion against our goal of a $150 billion in gross fundraising commitments since our 2020 Investor Day. And in Consumer Wealth Management, we had a record quarter. In Wealth Management, we've seen strong long-term fee-based inflows in the first nine months of the year, and as big client wins in Ayco that give us the opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations. In Consumer, we are now enabling 9 million customers to spend, borrow, and save on a multi-product platform. All in, our strong performance, tireless focus on our clients, and relentless execution of our strategy strengthened my confidence that we will continue to advance our strategic evolution and deliver higher, more durable returns for our shareholders. Let me now turn to Page 2. Broadly speaking, the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals, but there is increasing uncertainty around a number of factors. On the one hand, fiscal and monetary policy remain accommodative, and equity markets are still near all-time highs. COVID-19 vaccination rates are rising around the world. I believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemic's effects on the global economy. And as technology behind the vaccines continues to improve, we will make further progress against the virus. That being said, there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty we're paying close attention to. First, the trajectory of inflation, particularly wage inflation in the short-term. Second, there remains significant uncertainty around the Delta variant. Third, there is ongoing political debate in the U.S. over economic policy, including the potential for additional infrastructure deals, the longer-term extension of the federal debt ceiling and tax increases. And fourth, the U.S.-China relationship remains complicated. Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth. As further indicated by the downward revision in our economists, U.S. GDP expectations earlier this week. Regardless of the market backdrop, I consistently hear from clients how much they value the high-quality service we provide, especially our differentiated advise and execution capabilities. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to grow our firm. Activity levels remain high, particularly in Investment Banking and we have solid momentum in our Asset Management client business. Before I close, I would like to thank Stephen for his nearly three decades of service to the firm. I've had the privilege to work with Stephen since the early 2000s, and I couldn't be more grateful for his counsel and friendship over the last 20 years. In January, as we announced previously, Stephen will be succeeded by Denis Coleman, 25-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, which held numerous leadership positions with an Investment Banking, most recently as Co-Head of the Financing Group. He and Stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for almost 20 years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the CFO seat. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you, David. Good morning to all of you on the call. Before I turn to the results, let me say briefly that I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you, our shareholders, and the analyst community over the past three years as CFO. And I am committed to facilitating a smooth hand off to Dennis, who, as Carey noted, who's joined us on the call today. On our results, let me begin with our business performance by segment, starting on Page 4. I'm pleased to start with Investment Banking, which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its second-highest quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion. The consistency of performance in Investment Banking is a reflection of both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive position. Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were an all-time high. We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 32%. M&A activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT and healthcare, and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market. Underwriting results were strong notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the first half. Equity underwriting generated $1.2 billion in revenues, representing our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number 1 globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in excess of $110 billion across 570 deals, that represents volume market share of 10%. In debt underwriting, net revenues were 726 million dollars with performance supported by solid, high yield, and investment-grade issuance, as well as acquisition financing activity. Given the current levels of M&A announcements, and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors, we expect acquisition financing activity to remain high. Despite significant levels of completed transactions, our investment banking backlog, nonetheless ended the quarter, significantly higher than year-end levels. Corporate lending results of $152 million reflected revenues from transaction banking, middle-market lending, and the relationship loan book, including associated hedges. In transaction banking, we achieved our 5-year goal of $50 billion in deposits this quarter well ahead of the target date. As a key growth initiative for the firm with a very large addressable market, we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding customers and driving higher engagement on the platform, which has exceeded expectations. We remain confident in the longer-term revenue target for this business of $1 billion. Moving to global markets on page 5. Segment net revenues were $5.6 billion in the quarter, 23% higher year-on-year, driven by healthy client activity, notably in equities and a generally supportive market-making environment characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas. Results were also supported by recent market share gains across FICC and equities. Global markets again produced returns in excess of the target ROE expressed at our Investor Day, reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost. Turning to page 6, our FICC business is generated $2.5 billion of net revenues for the third quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates, credit, and mortgages offset by materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies. Activity increased into the end of the quarter with September proving to be a very strong month, our commodities business continued to perform well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas, and power. Fixed financing revenues of 513 million dollars were the best in over a decade. And we're up meaningfully, driven by mortgage lending consistent with our strategy. Total equities revenues of $3.1 billion were very strong, helped by higher results in equities intermediation amid better performance in both derivatives and cash, and record equities financing, as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients. Moving to Asset management on page 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.3 billion. Management and other fees totaled $724 million, which were impacted by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. We again extended these waivers for clients consistent with industry practice in this low rate environment. Equity investments produced net revenues of $935 million amid $1.6 billion of gains on our $16 billion private investment portfolio, plus our consolidated investment entities, partially offset by $820 million in losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions, which by contrast, were material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our CIE portfolio. Staying with asset management, page 8, again, provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt positions by vintage region, and where relevant accounting treatment. On page 9, we show a longer time series of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments. Since our 2020 Investor Day, we have actively harvested positions of $16 billion which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $5 billion, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. The implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is approximately $8 billion. We continue to have line of sight on $2.8 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $2 billion of capital reduction. We remain focused on the execution of this strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment. To this end, we sold over $1 billion of CIE portfolio during the quarter and also disposed of $2 billion of private positions. Moving to page 10, Consumer and Wealth Management produced record revenues of $2 billion in the third quarter. In Wealth Management, very strong long-term fee-based inflows for the year-to-date helped drive record management and other fees of $1.2 billion, which was 10% versus the second quarter and 28% year-on-year. Incentive fees of $121 million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds. Private banking and lending revenues of $292 million rose 12% with loans to private wealth clients up $2 billion sequentially. It's demand for lending products remains high amid the low rate environment. I would add that we view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering with room for further growth based on the needs of our clients and our current penetration rates, as well as the strong credit standing of this client base. Consumer banking revenues were $382 million in the quarter, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit balances year-over-year. We expect loan growth to accelerate in 2022, given the pending acquisitions of GreenSky and the General Motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product shed. Looking across these two segments, page 11, shows our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees. We've been building these businesses steadily, and total AUS now stands at a record $2.4 trillion, putting us in the top five of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally. This growth has driven higher firm-wide management and other fees, which rose 16% year-over-year to a record $1.9 billion. On page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the third quarter higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $143 billion up $12 billion sequentially, reflecting increases across the portfolio. Corresponding provision for credit losses of $175 million reflected portfolio growth. On page 13, you see our total quarterly operating expenses of 6.6 billion dollars. Our efficiency ratio for the year-to-date stands at 52.8%, reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a pay-for-performance culture, and investing for growth. Our year-to-date non-compensation expenses were down 17%, but up 11% ex-litigation, while our compensation expenses were up 34% on a year-to-date basis. Turning to capital on Slide 14, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.1% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially. Despite higher capital on solid earnings generation, the decline was driven largely by a $43-billion increase in RWAs, partially reflecting revisions to RWA calculations based on regulatory feedback in the quarter. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and $700 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns, and then return any excess to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of strong performance, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Additionally, we announced two acquisitions that will enhance both our asset management and consumer businesses, and increase the firm's recurring revenue stream. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set, remains attractive across the firm. As we continue to execute on our strategy, we are building towards a path to sustainable mid-teens returns. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thank you. Stephen, I wonder if I could ask a quick follow-up question on your comments just now on capital. So you make a ton of money, book is up 21% year-on-year, amazing. You did the GreenSky and NNIP deals, but RWA was up because activity is strong and SACCR is coming.  So I wonder if you could just peel back the onion a little bit more and just talk about where you see your excess position now and if at the margin we should be expecting continued investment in, say, the digital consumer builds at the margin, more so than the buybacks side. Thanks.\nStephen Scherr: Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that, especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in a quarter where we produce 22.5% ROE, it's that the reason and consistent with that, that we deploy the capital in the business.  I'd also point out that, in the dividend, our dividend is now at $2 a share, up from $1.25. So on an annual basis, we're returning an additional $1 billion or so to shareholders through the dividend. And where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive will return capital backend that that really represents what we do in terms of share repurchase. Now in terms of the opportunity set, you referred into the consumer business, it's unquestionably a priority. David had reflected time and again, the long-term view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to the firm. But I would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity, it is a broad look across the firm. And we think always about how do we add in an agile way, deploy capital across the whole of the business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that it's targeted against anyone in particular.  Obviously, we're operating at a higher SCB, a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the Fed, therefore, surplus is less. And we, consistent with the policy, always look forward to what will be in effect a petition on capital that we know. SACCR is certainly one of them. And in that regard, while we've not made a formal decision on implementation, and we'll let our regulators know when we do.  We're looking forward to that. And our view is that, when we put SACCR in place, it will increase our RWAs by about $15 billion or tax our ratio by about 30 basis points. It is at that level in part because, as we look back when SACCR was finalized by Basel in '14 and adopted by the Fed in '18 and '19, we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect.  So the implementation now reflects mitigation progress we've made in anticipation of it, as opposed to kind of a starting workstream. And obviously, the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuing through the rules could play out. But I think that's a reflection of a proactive engagement, so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio now, relative to what it would've been. And so -- sorry for the long answer, but that gives you kind of a complete picture, if you will, of how we're thinking about capital.\nGlenn Schorr: That was comprehensive. I appreciate it. Take notes then. One last follow-up because year-to-date revenues are up 42% and so strong, you made a ton of money. Comp dollars accrued are up 34%. I wonder if we could talk about that a little bit in terms of comp leverage, I know it's a bottom-up and I know a lot of people at Goldman Sachs are killing it at this year. But I think 1MDB impacted things last year. So just thinking full-year to full-year comp ratio, anything on the puts and takes on what to expect?\nStephen Scherr: So maybe I start with the numbers and then I'll turn it to David, who I think can reflect on kind of comp philosophy generally. But where we are right now, comp to net revenue, net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through nine months. That was at 34% when we ended the second quarter. We always reserve for compensation, consistent with what's required of us, which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance, as at that date, obviously, there's a quarter to go. So we're at a 31% ratio, revenue net of provision for credit loss.  You can see through nine months in the comp and benefits line, not to confuse the two numbers, that number is up 34%. Again, reflecting the performance of the business and a pay-for-performance philosophy more broadly. That 34% is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up 42% year-to-date and revenues net of provisions up 56%.  So you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we believe to be a healthy and robust comp process. I think overall, if you look at total operating expenses because we look at it that way, including our non-comp expense, there continues to be the exhibition of leverage, operating leverage in the business.  Again, revenue is up 42%, but total operating expenses ex-litigation are up 24%. And so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically. But maybe David wants to comment just on the philosophy.\nDavid Solomon: Glenn, I appreciate the question. I know one of the things you're getting at. There is no question, there is comp pressured, there's wage inflation everywhere at all aspects of every business right now, we're extremely focused on it. We are pay-for-performance culture, and there is no question that people are performing.  But we're very, very comfortable that we're managing this in a way where we can show real operating leverage to our shareholders given our performance, and at the same time, pay our people exceptionally for the exceptional performance. And we're on top of that. We feel good about it.\nGlenn Schorr: Thank you, both. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, David, Stephen, and welcome, Denis. Firstly, just to echo David\u2019s sentiment about Stephen. Congratulations and definitely will be very big shoes to fill for sure. So my first question here is on the digital consumer bank. That business continues to do very well. I think year-to-date, revenue growth is an impressive 30%, but that's still lags some of the pure-play neobanks out there.  And some of that might just be a function of product holes, I think a checking payment functions and investment functions, and Marcus, a little bit light. So curious here how you think about the product roadmap from here, from Marcus. The potential to use M&A to fill some of those gaps. And then longer-term, how should we think about sort of sustainable revenue growth for that business?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I'll start and Steven may add some comments, but we -- this is -- Christian, this is something that we're focused on over the long-term. I think we've built an excellent platform from a standing start of a 0. In five years, we felt a very, very significant depository institution with over $100 billion of digital deposits, no branches, very small marketing budget, a customer acquisition costs.  The cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very, very efficient, vis-\u00e0-vis the other models. We have 9 million customers that we're servicing right now. We have our own credit card platform that I think is really differentiated, and we're onboarding both other partnerships, but also have the opportunity for proprietary card that's in development.  We've talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during 2022, and that is on track and it's expanding. GreenSky allows us to broadly expand our point-of-sale capability. And was highlighted in the starting comments, their tech platform, their cloud-based technology integrates very seamlessly into what we're doing.  And so we feel very good about the fact that we're going to continue to grow this and build a consequential business. We have a long-term view with it. I am not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage, unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to look at a revenue growth model.  We're looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable recurring earnings to Goldman Sachs over time and to compound that. And we do believe that if we serve clients well in a seamless way with good technology, it will continue to grow and we will do that. I don't know, Stephen, if you have anything else you think should be added.\nStephen Scherr: Well, the only thing I'd add, Christian, is if you just look at the year-over-year comparison, right? So you can't forget that we went through kind of a more challenging period in COVID, where we by design look to limit the amount of underwriting we were doing. We're now coming back to sort of turn that back on, having seen the portfolio performed very well.  So year-over-year, revenues and consumer are up 23% in the deposit line. They're up 54% in credit cards. And that's just a reflection of the renewed commitment that David is reflecting to sort of growing out that business and seeing it perform. And I think David's comments are spot on.  If you look at loans and savings and Apple Card, soon to be joined by General Motors, investing module and checking, this is net -- what's coming into focus is a big, broad platform that can serve customers in all of their needs, as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set. And I think we're at a key moment now with the acquisition of GreenSky to sort of take that forward.\nChristian Bolu: Great. Thank you. My second question maybe is on, back to trading a bit of a high -- high, high-class problem here but the results are just another quarter of market share gains in the trading businesses. But the share gains have been so dramatic over the last few years that one has to wonder how sticky it could be going forward. Just curious how you think about sustainability of share gains in trading business as we roll into 2022 and 2023.\nDavid Solomon: Well, Christian, I appreciate your focus on the share gains. I don't -- I think it's a really important part and highlight of what we've been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out when we went back to Investor Day. And so I think there are a couple of things we've tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the position of this business. And I think the accruing results that will be quite sticky.  And I don't want to say that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they won't, we know that. But we've positioned the business much, much better for I think 2 principal reasons. Number 1, the business has been much more focused on having a client-centric one GF culture to really figure out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way.  The business has been less transactional, more long-term focused on the client relationship and the level of client service, while bringing to bear the market-making, provisioning, and financing capabilities of the firm that we have. And I'm hearing repeatedly from clients that they see a real switch in the way we're operating the business, and it's accruing the market share gains, it's benefiting us in that context.  Number 2, we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we could meaningfully grow and target. And so since the Investor Day, we targeted our ability to grow our financing capability across both equities and SEC, and we succeeded on that, and that's a place where we've taken market share. And that is more durable share, obviously.  And we continue to think there are opportunities that, we can continue to prosecute on -- on the financing side. And that's different. I would also highlight that we've been making significant investments in technology and we have the scale and have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients. And I think one of the things that's happening broadly is the leading players here, given the tech necessity, have an advantage to secondary or tertiary players.  And so we're benefiting from that also. Now there's no question, this is a very conducive environment the performance in that business, and we're not sitting here saying this level of performance will continue. But I think that the way we're running the business, the focus we've made, certainly takes us a step function up from where we were in 2019.  I'd also say as part of our Investor Day, we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business. And so even if we went back to a different level or at a higher hurdle return rate and the business at lower levels, and so we feel very good about the way the business is positioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nStephen Scherr: Hey, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Morning.\nSteven Chubak: I wanted to start off with a question. It's [Indiscernible] multifaceted one on just the sponsors and the alternative space. Sponsors have been really a significant and clearly growing contributor to increase M&A activity these last 12 months, you guys have certainly benefited from that. With [Indiscernible] with unique perspective into the business, just given you're building out your own third-party alternatives platform.  And you cited some really impressive fundraising numbers. I was hoping you could just speak to how much longer this frenzy pace of both fundraising and deal activity could persist, and whether there are any factors we should be watching, whether it's tax reform or higher rates that could potentially derail some of the momentum?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. And I'll try to talk at a high level about something Steve, and I think you're right. We're at a moment in time where the activity levels are quite high. First on fundraising, I just say that one of the reasons why we got very focused a few years ago in a much more organized way, growing our third-party capital and building institutional relationships to add to our alternatives platform, is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital allocation into alternatives.  And you get out and you get around the world, whether it's governments sovereign wealth funds or broad institutions. All of them or broad array of them are increasing their allocation to alternatives. I think, in addition, there's no question that we're in a position -- the world is in a position where retail participation to wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space.  And so there's more access being offered to wealthy individuals. We've always had a distribution channel with ultra-wealthy individuals, but that access is broadening more significantly. And so I do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad global alternatives platforms. I think we're very well-positioned for that, and so that's helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted.  With respect to deal activity there's a lot of dry powder out there. I would note that sponsor activity in M&A was a much higher percentage of activity this quarter than it's been over the last few years. And in the past, when sponsor activity has increased, it won for a while, but then ultimately it will be something that it facts it off. We're watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully, thinking very carefully about risk management around that. It feels at the moment, given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the reacceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic, that this will run for some while. But that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully because it won't sustain at this pace. We'll certainly be speed bumps along the way.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks, David for all that color. And maybe just for my follow-up, a question Steven, just on equity investments and the impact to capital. And one of the primary drivers of future SCB reduction, which you've talked about is the harvesting of those equity investments. We know they've got very punitive treatment in C-car.  And this is a high-class problem, shrinking the investments at least on a net basis, has proven rather difficult and remains stubbornly above that $20 billion level. How much smaller does the book need to get in order to meaningfully reduce your SCB? And is that 13% to 13.5% CET1 target still the appropriate long-term boggy just given some of the stubbornly high equity investments that persisted for the better part of a couple of years now?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. Let me start with the end part of your question. Our strongly held view is that 13% to 13.5% is the right place for this firm to operate. Now, our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the Fed is otherwise requiring of us in the context of CCAR and SCB. So in that context, what we can do and what we are doing is candidly taking action into our own hands. Meaning, we're not waiting for petitions to be well received in order that the requirement comes down.  But instead, we're pivoting and moving from Balance Sheet into fun format. I think, if you look at the page 9 in our -- in our deck what you'll see is what's happened in terms of $16 billion of dispositions, and what that has meant for AE free up. So I'll just give you a sense of it. In the last 9 months, we've seen reduction in balance sheet of $8.9 billion corresponding to $4.6 billion of AE.  Since Investor Day, $16.2 billion of reduction in balance sheet and $8.3 billion of freed AE. And we have line of sight from where we sit to about $2.8 billion of balance sheet reduction, freeing up about $2 billion of AE. I give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity that's been going on, that will continue.  And we had always focused in on whether or not at Investor Day we would experience a bit of a canyon, if you will, of revenue, meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace. Faster slope than what might have been a yawning line, if you will, to fundraising and deployment. That's not happening.  As David has said, we have $90 billion of fundraising, which -- and underlying that is about $50 billion of AUS, which is fee-paying. And so that transition is being managed well. And this just gives you a sense of the overall capital reduction in the context of what we're trying to achieve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler.\nJeff Harte: Good morning, guys.\nStephen Scherr: Hey, Jeff.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nJeff Harte: So Balance Sheet growth has stepped up since the pandemic and it's something we kind of been waiting for since the great financial crisis. Can you talk a bit about how much of that growth has really been driven by client demand for Balance Sheet, which would be a good thing versus just being a function of kind of QE in the flood of -- of liquidity in the market?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I would say that much of the balance sheet growth that has gone on has been attributed to client activity. If you just look at segment-by-segment, you look at growth in our financing activity in investment banking that supports our M&A franchise.  You look at financing that's going on in the context of both FICC and equities that were up year-on-year and that David was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability on the forward in our trading business. And so a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients. I would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet, it doesn't grow in isolation. Meaning we have various risk metrics that are in place, capital has obviously grown, liquidity maintained at the firm, obviously grows in the form of our GCLA. And so all of these I think are meant to be read in tandem. In the context of serving clients. But doing that in a way, where Balance Sheet growth is, held in the context of various risks. Be it capital and liquidity profile of the Firm itself.  We're not a bank, notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are experiencing the outsized growth in deposits that you're seeing or that you have seen at the bigger commercial banks. And that is inflating Balance Sheet there. We're not seeing that kind of inflation, frankly in part because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very usable deposits as a substitute for wholesale funding.\nJeff Harte: Okay. And as we think about the kind of recurring question for a number of quarters now, of capital markets and how sustainable are these really strong activity levels, understanding that you can't predict and things could shut off tomorrow. How do you think about things like Investment banking and global markets when you look at the budgeting process into next year and maybe the year beyond? I mean, how do you approach that? What's your outlook from that perspective?\nDavid Solomon: I think our outlook, there are confluence, the things Jeff that are going on that are obviously quite accommodative for this. You're right, at any point in time, that mix could change and we wouldn't see the same robust amount of client activity. But we have fundamental growth. In markets, we have fundamental growth and economic activity around the world. And that over periods of time grows long-term growth in these business platforms.  So I certainly would say we were running at very, very robust capital markets activity in the investment banking franchise at the moment. But I'd also say whenever things slowed down or rebalance a little, we're going to find that these businesses are baseline fundamentally larger than they were five years ago because of the growth in market capital world and the growth in economic activity in the world.  And so we've always said that there's a real correlation to economic activity to our activity. There's real correlation in market cap growth to our activity. Obviously, these things will ebb and flow. But we have lots of flexibility in the context and the way we manage the businesses. And these businesses, I think will continue to be strong performers even in different environment, they just might not perform at this level all the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nStephen Scherr: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hey. So we talked a little bit earlier about market share and market share opportunities. I just wanted to take a slightly different angle on that and ask the question about where you think you're punching below your weight, if we could think about that being an opportunity from a regional perspective. So especially in Europe or Latin America, maybe Asia, you could speak to where you think you have opportunities in those regions. Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: I mean, I point to a couple of things at a high level, Betsy, there's no question. One of the reasons why NN was really attractive to us is that in our asset management business, we've been punching below our weight across Europe, both in terms of the assets that we were supervising, but also on our distribution capabilities and accelerates that. I still think there's more opportunity there.  I do think around some of the public portion of our GSAM business across the world. There's still opportunities for us to punch with a better way, even though at this point, we're one of the top five active Asset managers. And so we continue to think about that as an opportunity.  I think there are opportunities for us around the Wealth Management business, in particular in Europe and we've been focused on that. I think there are wealth management opportunities for us in the U.S. as we move from simply managing money with ultra-high net worth clienteles that have been our traditional PWN business to a more mass affluent structure in using digital technology and extending the use of Ayco.  China is another place where there's opportunity for us from a wealth management perspective, and you've seen we've announced our joint venture with ICBC, which we think is an interesting opportunity in that part of the world. And so those are a handful of things from a regionalized basis, I would highlight.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi.\nStephen Scherr: Hey, Mike.\nMike Mayo: I was wondering if you could just kind of mark-to-mark us on your Sachs successes or initiatives. As you mentioned, year-to-date growth and revenues is 2 or 3 times that of expenses, so you're getting the higher marginal margin. Now some of that's due to the bull market. You mentioned comp leverage, but then, how much of that is due to technology? So I guess, one way to phrase this question is by area.  So you have your new growth initiatives You mentioned digital deposits of a $100 billion transaction banking deposit was $50 billion. I think that's pouring the cloud. And then you have your legacy trading activities where I guess there's been a\nStephen Scherr: lot of electronification than there is the rest of the Company, where I'm not really sure what the tech backbone is. So the question is, how much has the tech backbone contributed to that higher marginal margin for each the growth areas, trading and the rest of the firm?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I'll start, Mike, and Stephen I'm sure will have some things to add here, too. At a high level, we're spending significantly on technology to expand the platforms that we operate on, to better connect to our clients, and to enable us obviously to operate more efficiently. We're performing very well at the moment.  But our commitment to continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the Cloud for a variety of reasons, which I will highlight in just a second, I think it's something that we've been very focused on strategically and it continues, but we're in the middle of the execution path.  Historically, developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build an [Indiscernible] technology, and Cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly service our clients\u2019 needs.  Rather than doing what I call is undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech bill that managed what was more traditional tech infrastructure. The cloud really provides low friction access to technologies such as big data, machine learning, analytics, which enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to connect with us.  And it's allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have, and you highlighted some of them, like transaction banking and some of the things we're doing on the market platform. And so there's no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that. We know that the cloud is not for everything, and so there is some services, I give you an example like high-frequency trading that are better-served on-premise.  And so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment, and we also choose our partners in kind of a multi-cloud or what we call Poly Cloud strategy so that we can take the best-of-breed offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do for our clients. So overall, we're in this journey.  That's very, very intentional. It's aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently. And I think we're getting real benefit from it in the execution of our strategy. But I think there's more upside in that as we continue to build the financial clouds, so to speak, for some of our principal businesses. I mean, Stephen, would you add anything to that or do you want to quantify some things a little more?\nStephen Scherr: Yeah, the only thing I'd add was a bit of quantification. So Mike, if you -- you heard me say before, our non-comp expenses, so excluding litigation to just looking at the core non-comp expense, year-to-date is up 11%. If you look at the gross expense that that represents, about a 1/3 of that increase is related to technology.  So we're about a third of the increase of non-compensation expense in the firm through the first 9 months relates to technology. And this is spent all across the firm. so it's both in particular initiatives like consumer TXP McKee (ph) but equally, it's been broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm.  Cloud-based engineering is one that David brought to your attention. In all of these spends, we sweat the ROI of this investment. And so, as an example, part of the uplift will enable us to create greater opportunity for automation, which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm. So I just offer that to you, just to give you some sort of dimension, if you will, from a true expense line as to what David was otherwise describing.\nMike Mayo: And just a follow-up, maybe digging deeper on our transaction banking. I have to be a little skeptical, but you did get your five-year target, as you said. And so, if you think about the cloud, cloud-enabled, cloud-native or I think in that case foreign in the cloud, can you just define really what that means? Is that the nirvana state of being in the cloud, the way you have transaction banking? And to what degree has that contributed to you getting your $50 billion? And by the way, does that $50 billion include any deposits from Goldman Sachs itself?\nStephen Scherr: So I don't believe that there are GS deposits in it. It's 50 billion of gross deposits. And as we've said, that's now become about 25% operational, so a value to us. But just to come back to your question about the Cloud. So the TXP business was built entirely in the Cloud. I don't know that I would necessarily conclude that that is why it's been successful.  I would conclude, however, that it is how it's been built on a very cost-efficient basis and built with a level of security that I think satisfies us and our client base, meaning I think it's a drop card in the context of it. The reason Mike is self-evident, which is that it's built-in the Cloud, as David noted, it's not built with multiple instances of the transaction banking platform across redundant datacenters.  It benefits without necessarily costing us to improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like. That is the benefit of sitting within the cloud itself. So I can't tell you that I could draw a line to the deposits that have come in. I can tell you that we built it better, cheaper, and on a more attractive basis to facilitate client -attention and attraction to it.\nDavid Solomon: The one thing though -- one thing, Mike, that I want to add very, very clearly. the reason our transaction banking platform is I think accelerating and its success, is because the quality of the offering for our clients is differentiated and better meeting their needs than the existing offerings.  And part of the reason, as Steven highlighted, we could do that so quickly was because it's easier to build on the Cloud and transition. But fundamentally, this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform, that took friction out of an activity that was deeply embedded on our corporate clients.  As a user of that activity, we saw that experience and we saw that there were ways that that experience could be improved. And we've built a platform that delivers a better experience. And that's why it's succeeding. That's why it's meeting targets and continuing to grow. And that's why we're very optimistic.  Stephen laid out few a billion dollars of revenue. We're confident in that target. And this business has margin in it and will be a good contributor. And so we're very confident about how we'll continue to execute. But fundamentally it's not the quality of the product we're delivering to our clients.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just congrats, best of luck to you, Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you\nBrennan Hawken: And Dennis congrats to you also on the new role, looking forward to working together. Maybe we could start with the GreenSky acquisition. So the Firm, a lot of investors see how the stock has performed since the IPO pointed to spotty history and underwriting and the Firm began exploring strategic alternatives in August of 2019.  So could you maybe add your perspective on why this was the right franchise to connect your growing consumer banking business. And maybe what you think the market might not be appreciating or understanding about this Company that led you to be interested in acquiring it.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I'll start here on that. And I appreciate the question, Brennan. But first, it's a very different Company as an independent public Company, than it is as a platform inside Goldman Sachs. And one of the big weaknesses of the Company as an independent public Company is it didn't have a funding model, and it had to fund differently. Inside Goldman Sachs, we have funding.  An attractive funding that becomes a technology platform that allows us to connect to a very attractive base of customers that we can pull into the market's ecosystem. I think the merchant network that they develop, well over 10,000 merchants, and they developed over 15 years is extremely valuable.  And then the work we did to try to have a point-of-sale merchant network and look at that, we think it would have taken us close to ten years to develop a similar network. And so the ability to acquire that network, bringing very, very high-quality customer, these are customers that aren't homes, these are customers that have high FICO Scores, very, very attractive into Goldman Sachs.  It allowed us to do something that fits seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the point-of-sale activities that we were doing. And so we feel very, very good about it. And we think that this acquisition will consistently deliver 20%+ returns on the activity that it generates.\nBrennan Hawken: Great, thanks for -- thanks for that David. Maybe following up on that, could you provide some context around the strategic priorities from here. You've done 2 recent acquisitions, smaller both on size, but certainly a bit of activity. When you think about the different businesses in which you want to grow you've done a lot of these smaller bolt-on, some in the wealth side, with United Capital and Folio several years ago, at NN and G-Sky more recently.  Going from here, is there any particular business that you think is quite compelling, given either some combination of ripe inorganic opportunities that the market might be under-appreciating, similar to -- or your -- the platform can be different within Goldman than it is as a standalone, the way it was wit GreenSky. How should investors think about priorities and direction from here, and how they stack?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Brennan. I will bring you back -- I really want to bring you back and center you to -- center you around what we said during our Investor Day. We laid out a strategy that said we will continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market share and increase of positioning. I think we've done that.  There's still some opportunities to continue to do that. But we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position while also increasing the mix of durable fee-based revenues into the business. And when you look at those areas, it's transaction banking, it's asset management, it's wealth management, and it's our digital consumer bank. And so as we look forward, I still think there are opportunities to grow all four of those areas. I think we can continue to grow them organically, but when there are opportunities to make an acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas, we're going to take a hard look at it. As I've said before, the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high. I think there is still opportunities -- there may be opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas.  But we are focused on those 4 areas because those 4 areas diversify the durability of our revenues and allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream. And so that's the frame that we'll continue to look at. I wouldn't point to anything more specifically.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess. First question -- just want to dig in a little bit on the Asset management and the opportunity on the third-party alternatives fundraising. And just the ability to continue to scale that both on the customer side and product side. And when we look at some of the, I guess stand-alone alternative manager peers, they've done a great job in recent years of expanding the product menu, and then consolidating LP relationships where they're connecting on numerous products, and so that effectively creates a network effect.  And so we're looking at Goldman, where do you guys feel like you are with LPs? And is the opportunity to add more LPs or is it bigger opportunity to connect with more Goldman Sachs product. And then I guess on the product side, alternatives, are there any areas where you feel like you could accelerate investment or those could be areas that could help you connect, I guess, with your existing LPs on more products?\nDavid Solomon: So when we -- when we -- I appreciate the question, Devin. It's obviously something strategically we've been very focused on. But I'll go back to some of the things that we said at Investor Day, that kind of geared our focus on this. We've been in these businesses for a long time, and we actually have something that I think is very differentiated and that we have a truly broad global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years.  We have positions in private equity, in growth equity, in credit, in real estate, in infrastructure, and we also have them globally around the world. And when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms, there are some that have that broad array, but very few have all the products on a global basis the way we are set up.  What was differentiated or different about our business and alternatives before we roll that together and got it focused, is generally our LP relationships, came through our private wealth network. And we've raised an enormous amount of money through our private wealth network, including the partners of the firm, while we had some institutional LP relationships. We had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform.  And given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities, we knew that if we took a one-GS approach at really taking a long-term view and building relationships with those institutional partners, we could grow our partnership with them. So a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new LPs to our ecosystem. And if you look at strategic solutions, which we raised last year, there were a number of probably a dozen new significant institutional LP that the first time they were coming onto our platform was in that strategic solutions fund.  So I think it's a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that, it's something we're very focused on. But the opportunity for us is less than product addition. Although we are at in products, we just raised the horizon fund, which is an ESG centered funds, will allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies.  And we'll add other product capability that we think are interesting. But our focus is on meaningfully using the Goldman Sachs platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand [Indiscernible] institutional LLPs that are partnered with us. And I think we have a lot of upside to run on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you. Just one question. David. Adjust to us how you're thinking about just digital assets. As you're seeing the entire ecosystem being built around digital asset custody tokenization. Just give us a perspective because it feels like all of that would be writing Goldman's wheelhouse to capitalized as some of these things accelerate, so I would love to hear your perspective on one, how you see just that entire ecosystem developing and the role Goldman can play in that.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So there's no question that activities that we're involved in are digitizing quickly. I think there is a meaningful acceleration in the disruption that the digitalization of financial services is occurring. There are places that, that digitization is allowing us to disrupt and accelerate our position.  The two we've talked about a bunch today on this call that are happening because the digital infrastructure, our ability to do what we're doing in transaction banking, is taking some of this digital disruption and using it in a different way. What we're doing in building a digital consumer bank is also relying on this. You know the broader -- digital ecosystem, I think it's an early stage as I think we're version 1.0 I think you'll continue to see a lot of disruption on traditional ways that financial services are delivered and consumed.  I think big competitive platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are remediated. I think there are lots of complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this as the technology allows for more disruption, but I think we're very early in the game and I think it is a big opportunity for the firm and the firm continues to be focused on it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you could just elaborate on, what drove the increase in RWAs from the regulatory guidance this quarter, please.\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So we had about $42 billion increase in RWAs -- about half of that related to changes in the methodology that we're using in the computation of the RWAs. And that was the byproduct of just routine and ongoing discussion with regulators. And so that plays through in the third quarter ratio, will play through on the forward.  But that's really the source of about 50% of the RWA lift. The other 50% is obviously in the context of the overall business and risk and exposure that's attending there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hello, Steven. Hello, David.\nStephen Scherr: Hey, Gerard.\nDavid Solomon: Hey Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Steph -- Stephen, can you share with us on -- you mentioned in the transaction backing you've got to the 50 billion in deposits, which is ahead of schedule, and you're still confident you're going to reach the $1 billion in revenues. Back in the Investor Day, when you gave us those numbers, were those numbers linked? Meaning were they supposed to kind of be achieved around the same time? And then second, when do you think you'll reach that billion-dollar target?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So the targets were set at the same time, though bear in mind the environment then and now is quite different in the context of interest rates. So we've seen fed funds come down from the time of Investor Day. I don't know, I want to say about a 150 basis points, maybe a little more.  The consequence of that is that, the value of deposits that the economic value of deposits is not as rich now, as we had imagined back at Investor Day. But equally in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates, we'll see a return to the value of those deposits, otherwise modeled out. And therefore on the forward rate curve our view is that we'll be able to achieve that billion-dollar revenue target. I point out that of the 50 billion more of them are operational. That's step one to achieving the value of that. And that has been a big quarter-on-quarter increase from about 14% the last quarter. And I think more broadly in transaction banking, about 2/3 of the revenue from the time we modeled through now is correlated to deposit intake with the balance around FX and other fees. And so as we see interest rates come back, the value of those deposits will as well.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please, continue with any closing remarks.\nStephen Scherr: So since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our Senior Management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth-quarter call in January. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you, Carey, and good morning, everybody. I'm joining you today from California, where we have been hosting one of our best-known client events, the Builders + Innovators Summit. We bring together over a 100 of the most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build successful and enduring companies. I've heard from a number of them that they are extremely excited to meet with our team and with other entrepreneurs here in California. In addition, over the last few months, I've also been able to travel around to spend time with our employees and clients in person, which has been invigorating. In my conversations with clients, and then the results we're reporting today, it's clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing. This quarter, we announced two acquisitions. A key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our Investor Day in 2020, centered around diversifying our business mix towards more recurring revenues and durable earnings. There's no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans. And now, we are further investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution. First, in August, we announced the acquisition of a leading European asset manager, NN Investment Partners. The addition of $320 billion in assets under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our asset management platforms, enhance our distribution network on the continent, and bolster our ESG capabilities. On the topic of ESG, as world leaders prepare to convene in Glasgow later this month for COP26, I would like to underscore the firm's commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth. And we're making progress towards our target of $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity to help achieve these goals. My view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more sustainable future. This includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon. This transition is complex and won't happen overnight. It will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part. And given the fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future, it is critical that we strike a balance between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face. Our second acquisition was GreenSky, which we announced in September. This transaction furthers our efforts to build the consumer banking platform of the future, that provides our consumer business with an attractive and high credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over 10,000 merchants and a secularly growing market, that's a digital cloud-based infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform. And with the addition of our bank funding model, we expect to generate 20%-plus returns at scale for recurring fee-based in net interest income revenues. Importantly, these customers will be our customers. They will live in the market's ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives. Turning to Page 1 of our presentation. We produced net revenues of $13.6 billion, driven by year-on-year increases in three of our four business segments. On the bottom line, we delivered net earnings of $5.4 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $14.93. Our year-to-date revenues of nearly $47 billion and net earnings of over $17.5 billion are higher than any full-year results in our history, and drove an ROE of nearly 26% and an ROT of over 27%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and a supportive market environment. In Investment Banking, we produced our second highest quarterly revenues. Our clients who are extremely active, they turned to Goldman Sachs for our leading M&A franchise, driving strategic activity and associated financing to elevated levels. We delivered solid results in global markets as we continue to focus on market share and engage with clients on a broader array of solutions. In Asset Management, assets under supervision hit another record of $1.7 trillion, which will be further enhanced by the NNIP acquisition. We continue to transition our alternatives business to more third-party funds, and we have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients, raising $90 billion against our goal of a $150 billion in gross fundraising commitments since our 2020 Investor Day. And in Consumer Wealth Management, we had a record quarter. In Wealth Management, we've seen strong long-term fee-based inflows in the first nine months of the year, and as big client wins in Ayco that give us the opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations. In Consumer, we are now enabling 9 million customers to spend, borrow, and save on a multi-product platform. All in, our strong performance, tireless focus on our clients, and relentless execution of our strategy strengthened my confidence that we will continue to advance our strategic evolution and deliver higher, more durable returns for our shareholders. Let me now turn to Page 2. Broadly speaking, the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals, but there is increasing uncertainty around a number of factors. On the one hand, fiscal and monetary policy remain accommodative, and equity markets are still near all-time highs. COVID-19 vaccination rates are rising around the world. I believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemic's effects on the global economy. And as technology behind the vaccines continues to improve, we will make further progress against the virus. That being said, there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty we're paying close attention to. First, the trajectory of inflation, particularly wage inflation in the short-term. Second, there remains significant uncertainty around the Delta variant. Third, there is ongoing political debate in the U.S. over economic policy, including the potential for additional infrastructure deals, the longer-term extension of the federal debt ceiling and tax increases. And fourth, the U.S.-China relationship remains complicated. Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth. As further indicated by the downward revision in our economists, U.S. GDP expectations earlier this week. Regardless of the market backdrop, I consistently hear from clients how much they value the high-quality service we provide, especially our differentiated advise and execution capabilities. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to grow our firm. Activity levels remain high, particularly in Investment Banking and we have solid momentum in our Asset Management client business. Before I close, I would like to thank Stephen for his nearly three decades of service to the firm. I've had the privilege to work with Stephen since the early 2000s, and I couldn't be more grateful for his counsel and friendship over the last 20 years. In January, as we announced previously, Stephen will be succeeded by Denis Coleman, 25-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, which held numerous leadership positions with an Investment Banking, most recently as Co-Head of the Financing Group. He and Stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for almost 20 years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the CFO seat. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. Glenn, I appreciate the question. I know one of the things you're getting at. There is no question, there is comp pressured, there's wage inflation everywhere at all aspects of every business right now, we're extremely focused on it. We are pay-for-performance culture, and there is no question that people are performing.  But we're very, very comfortable that we're managing this in a way where we can show real operating leverage to our shareholders given our performance, and at the same time, pay our people exceptionally for the exceptional performance. And we're on top of that. We feel good about it. Sure. I'll start and Steven may add some comments, but we -- this is -- Christian, this is something that we're focused on over the long-term. I think we've built an excellent platform from a standing start of a 0. In five years, we felt a very, very significant depository institution with over $100 billion of digital deposits, no branches, very small marketing budget, a customer acquisition costs.  The cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very, very efficient, vis-a\u0300-vis the other models. We have 9 million customers that we're servicing right now. We have our own credit card platform that I think is really differentiated, and we're onboarding both other partnerships, but also have the opportunity for proprietary card that's in development.  We've talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during 2022, and that is on track and it's expanding. GreenSky allows us to broadly expand our point-of-sale capability. And was highlighted in the starting comments, their tech platform, their cloud-based technology integrates very seamlessly into what we're doing.  And so we feel very good about the fact that we're going to continue to grow this and build a consequential business. We have a long-term view with it. I am not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage, unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to look at a revenue growth model.  We're looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable recurring earnings to Goldman Sachs over time and to compound that. And we do believe that if we serve clients well in a seamless way with good technology, it will continue to grow and we will do that. I don't know, Stephen, if you have anything else you think should be added. Well, Christian, I appreciate your focus on the share gains. I don't -- I think it's a really important part and highlight of what we've been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out when we went back to Investor Day. And so I think there are a couple of things we've tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the position of this business. And I think the accruing results that will be quite sticky.  And I don't want to say that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they won't, we know that. But we've positioned the business much, much better for I think 2 principal reasons. Number 1, the business has been much more focused on having a client-centric one GF culture to really figure out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way.  The business has been less transactional, more long-term focused on the client relationship and the level of client service, while bringing to bear the market-making, provisioning, and financing capabilities of the firm that we have. And I'm hearing repeatedly from clients that they see a real switch in the way we're operating the business, and it's accruing the market share gains, it's benefiting us in that context.  Number 2, we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we could meaningfully grow and target. And so since the Investor Day, we targeted our ability to grow our financing capability across both equities and SEC, and we succeeded on that, and that's a place where we've taken market share. And that is more durable share, obviously.  And we continue to think there are opportunities that, we can continue to prosecute on -- on the financing side. And that's different. I would also highlight that we've been making significant investments in technology and we have the scale and have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients. And I think one of the things that's happening broadly is the leading players here, given the tech necessity, have an advantage to secondary or tertiary players.  And so we're benefiting from that also. Now there's no question, this is a very conducive environment the performance in that business, and we're not sitting here saying this level of performance will continue. But I think that the way we're running the business, the focus we've made, certainly takes us a step function up from where we were in 2019.  I'd also say as part of our Investor Day, we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business. And so even if we went back to a different level or at a higher hurdle return rate and the business at lower levels, and so we feel very good about the way the business is positioned. Morning. Sure. And I'll try to talk at a high level about something Steve, and I think you're right. We're at a moment in time where the activity levels are quite high. First on fundraising, I just say that one of the reasons why we got very focused a few years ago in a much more organized way, growing our third-party capital and building institutional relationships to add to our alternatives platform, is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital allocation into alternatives.  And you get out and you get around the world, whether it's governments sovereign wealth funds or broad institutions. All of them or broad array of them are increasing their allocation to alternatives. I think, in addition, there's no question that we're in a position -- the world is in a position where retail participation to wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space.  And so there's more access being offered to wealthy individuals. We've always had a distribution channel with ultra-wealthy individuals, but that access is broadening more significantly. And so I do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad global alternatives platforms. I think we're very well-positioned for that, and so that's helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted.  With respect to deal activity there's a lot of dry powder out there. I would note that sponsor activity in M&A was a much higher percentage of activity this quarter than it's been over the last few years. And in the past, when sponsor activity has increased, it won for a while, but then ultimately it will be something that it facts it off. We're watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully, thinking very carefully about risk management around that. It feels at the moment, given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the reacceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic, that this will run for some while. But that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully because it won't sustain at this pace. We'll certainly be speed bumps along the way. Good morning. I think our outlook, there are confluence, the things Jeff that are going on that are obviously quite accommodative for this. You're right, at any point in time, that mix could change and we wouldn't see the same robust amount of client activity. But we have fundamental growth. In markets, we have fundamental growth and economic activity around the world. And that over periods of time grows long-term growth in these business platforms.  So I certainly would say we were running at very, very robust capital markets activity in the investment banking franchise at the moment. But I'd also say whenever things slowed down or rebalance a little, we're going to find that these businesses are baseline fundamentally larger than they were five years ago because of the growth in market capital world and the growth in economic activity in the world.  And so we've always said that there's a real correlation to economic activity to our activity. There's real correlation in market cap growth to our activity. Obviously, these things will ebb and flow. But we have lots of flexibility in the context and the way we manage the businesses. And these businesses, I think will continue to be strong performers even in different environment, they just might not perform at this level all the time. Good morning. I mean, I point to a couple of things at a high level, Betsy, there's no question. One of the reasons why NN was really attractive to us is that in our asset management business, we've been punching below our weight across Europe, both in terms of the assets that we were supervising, but also on our distribution capabilities and accelerates that. I still think there's more opportunity there.  I do think around some of the public portion of our GSAM business across the world. There's still opportunities for us to punch with a better way, even though at this point, we're one of the top five active Asset managers. And so we continue to think about that as an opportunity.  I think there are opportunities for us around the Wealth Management business, in particular in Europe and we've been focused on that. I think there are wealth management opportunities for us in the U.S. as we move from simply managing money with ultra-high net worth clienteles that have been our traditional PWN business to a more mass affluent structure in using digital technology and extending the use of Ayco.  China is another place where there's opportunity for us from a wealth management perspective, and you've seen we've announced our joint venture with ICBC, which we think is an interesting opportunity in that part of the world. And so those are a handful of things from a regionalized basis, I would highlight. Well, I'll start, Mike, and Stephen I'm sure will have some things to add here, too. At a high level, we're spending significantly on technology to expand the platforms that we operate on, to better connect to our clients, and to enable us obviously to operate more efficiently. We're performing very well at the moment.  But our commitment to continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the Cloud for a variety of reasons, which I will highlight in just a second, I think it's something that we've been very focused on strategically and it continues, but we're in the middle of the execution path.  Historically, developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build an [Indiscernible] technology, and Cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly service our clients' needs.  Rather than doing what I call is undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech bill that managed what was more traditional tech infrastructure. The cloud really provides low friction access to technologies such as big data, machine learning, analytics, which enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to connect with us.  And it's allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have, and you highlighted some of them, like transaction banking and some of the things we're doing on the market platform. And so there's no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that. We know that the cloud is not for everything, and so there is some services, I give you an example like high-frequency trading that are better-served on-premise.  And so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment, and we also choose our partners in kind of a multi-cloud or what we call Poly Cloud strategy so that we can take the best-of-breed offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do for our clients. So overall, we're in this journey.  That's very, very intentional. It's aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently. And I think we're getting real benefit from it in the execution of our strategy. But I think there's more upside in that as we continue to build the financial clouds, so to speak, for some of our principal businesses. I mean, Stephen, would you add anything to that or do you want to quantify some things a little more? The one thing though -- one thing, Mike, that I want to add very, very clearly. the reason our transaction banking platform is I think accelerating and its success, is because the quality of the offering for our clients is differentiated and better meeting their needs than the existing offerings.  And part of the reason, as Steven highlighted, we could do that so quickly was because it's easier to build on the Cloud and transition. But fundamentally, this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform, that took friction out of an activity that was deeply embedded on our corporate clients.  As a user of that activity, we saw that experience and we saw that there were ways that that experience could be improved. And we've built a platform that delivers a better experience. And that's why it's succeeding. That's why it's meeting targets and continuing to grow. And that's why we're very optimistic.  Stephen laid out few a billion dollars of revenue. We're confident in that target. And this business has margin in it and will be a good contributor. And so we're very confident about how we'll continue to execute. But fundamentally it's not the quality of the product we're delivering to our clients. Sure. I'll start here on that. And I appreciate the question, Brennan. But first, it's a very different Company as an independent public Company, than it is as a platform inside Goldman Sachs. And one of the big weaknesses of the Company as an independent public Company is it didn't have a funding model, and it had to fund differently. Inside Goldman Sachs, we have funding.  An attractive funding that becomes a technology platform that allows us to connect to a very attractive base of customers that we can pull into the market's ecosystem. I think the merchant network that they develop, well over 10,000 merchants, and they developed over 15 years is extremely valuable.  And then the work we did to try to have a point-of-sale merchant network and look at that, we think it would have taken us close to ten years to develop a similar network. And so the ability to acquire that network, bringing very, very high-quality customer, these are customers that aren't homes, these are customers that have high FICO Scores, very, very attractive into Goldman Sachs.  It allowed us to do something that fits seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the point-of-sale activities that we were doing. And so we feel very, very good about it. And we think that this acquisition will consistently deliver 20%+ returns on the activity that it generates. Sure, Brennan. I will bring you back -- I really want to bring you back and center you to -- center you around what we said during our Investor Day. We laid out a strategy that said we will continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market share and increase of positioning. I think we've done that.  There's still some opportunities to continue to do that. But we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position while also increasing the mix of durable fee-based revenues into the business. And when you look at those areas, it's transaction banking, it's asset management, it's wealth management, and it's our digital consumer bank. And so as we look forward, I still think there are opportunities to grow all four of those areas. I think we can continue to grow them organically, but when there are opportunities to make an acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas, we're going to take a hard look at it. As I've said before, the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high. I think there is still opportunities -- there may be opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas.  But we are focused on those 4 areas because those 4 areas diversify the durability of our revenues and allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream. And so that's the frame that we'll continue to look at. I wouldn't point to anything more specifically. So when we -- when we -- I appreciate the question, Devin. It's obviously something strategically we've been very focused on. But I'll go back to some of the things that we said at Investor Day, that kind of geared our focus on this. We've been in these businesses for a long time, and we actually have something that I think is very differentiated and that we have a truly broad global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years.  We have positions in private equity, in growth equity, in credit, in real estate, in infrastructure, and we also have them globally around the world. And when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms, there are some that have that broad array, but very few have all the products on a global basis the way we are set up.  What was differentiated or different about our business and alternatives before we roll that together and got it focused, is generally our LP relationships, came through our private wealth network. And we've raised an enormous amount of money through our private wealth network, including the partners of the firm, while we had some institutional LP relationships. We had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform.  And given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities, we knew that if we took a one-GS approach at really taking a long-term view and building relationships with those institutional partners, we could grow our partnership with them. So a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new LPs to our ecosystem. And if you look at strategic solutions, which we raised last year, there were a number of probably a dozen new significant institutional LP that the first time they were coming onto our platform was in that strategic solutions fund.  So I think it's a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that, it's something we're very focused on. But the opportunity for us is less than product addition. Although we are at in products, we just raised the horizon fund, which is an ESG centered funds, will allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies.  And we'll add other product capability that we think are interesting. But our focus is on meaningfully using the Goldman Sachs platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand [Indiscernible] institutional LLPs that are partnered with us. And I think we have a lot of upside to run on that. Sure. So there's no question that activities that we're involved in are digitizing quickly. I think there is a meaningful acceleration in the disruption that the digitalization of financial services is occurring. There are places that, that digitization is allowing us to disrupt and accelerate our position.  The two we've talked about a bunch today on this call that are happening because the digital infrastructure, our ability to do what we're doing in transaction banking, is taking some of this digital disruption and using it in a different way. What we're doing in building a digital consumer bank is also relying on this. You know the broader -- digital ecosystem, I think it's an early stage as I think we're version 1.0 I think you'll continue to see a lot of disruption on traditional ways that financial services are delivered and consumed.  I think big competitive platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are remediated. I think there are lots of complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this as the technology allows for more disruption, but I think we're very early in the game and I think it is a big opportunity for the firm and the firm continues to be focused on it. Hey Gerard."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning to all of you on the call. Before I turn to the results, let me say briefly that I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you, our shareholders, and the analyst community over the past three years as CFO. And I am committed to facilitating a smooth hand off to Dennis, who, as Carey noted, who's joined us on the call today. On our results, let me begin with our business performance by segment, starting on Page 4. I'm pleased to start with Investment Banking, which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its second-highest quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion. The consistency of performance in Investment Banking is a reflection of both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive position. Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were an all-time high. We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 32%. M&A activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT and healthcare, and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market. Underwriting results were strong notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the first half. Equity underwriting generated $1.2 billion in revenues, representing our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked number 1 globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in excess of $110 billion across 570 deals, that represents volume market share of 10%. In debt underwriting, net revenues were 726 million dollars with performance supported by solid, high yield, and investment-grade issuance, as well as acquisition financing activity. Given the current levels of M&A announcements, and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors, we expect acquisition financing activity to remain high. Despite significant levels of completed transactions, our investment banking backlog, nonetheless ended the quarter, significantly higher than year-end levels. Corporate lending results of $152 million reflected revenues from transaction banking, middle-market lending, and the relationship loan book, including associated hedges. In transaction banking, we achieved our 5-year goal of $50 billion in deposits this quarter well ahead of the target date. As a key growth initiative for the firm with a very large addressable market, we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding customers and driving higher engagement on the platform, which has exceeded expectations. We remain confident in the longer-term revenue target for this business of $1 billion. Moving to global markets on page 5. Segment net revenues were $5.6 billion in the quarter, 23% higher year-on-year, driven by healthy client activity, notably in equities and a generally supportive market-making environment characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas. Results were also supported by recent market share gains across FICC and equities. Global markets again produced returns in excess of the target ROE expressed at our Investor Day, reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost. Turning to page 6, our FICC business is generated $2.5 billion of net revenues for the third quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates, credit, and mortgages offset by materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies. Activity increased into the end of the quarter with September proving to be a very strong month, our commodities business continued to perform well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas, and power. Fixed financing revenues of 513 million dollars were the best in over a decade. And we're up meaningfully, driven by mortgage lending consistent with our strategy. Total equities revenues of $3.1 billion were very strong, helped by higher results in equities intermediation amid better performance in both derivatives and cash, and record equities financing, as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients. Moving to Asset management on page 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.3 billion. Management and other fees totaled $724 million, which were impacted by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. We again extended these waivers for clients consistent with industry practice in this low rate environment. Equity investments produced net revenues of $935 million amid $1.6 billion of gains on our $16 billion private investment portfolio, plus our consolidated investment entities, partially offset by $820 million in losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions, which by contrast, were material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our CIE portfolio. Staying with asset management, page 8, again, provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt positions by vintage region, and where relevant accounting treatment. On page 9, we show a longer time series of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments. Since our 2020 Investor Day, we have actively harvested positions of $16 billion which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $5 billion, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. The implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is approximately $8 billion. We continue to have line of sight on $2.8 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $2 billion of capital reduction. We remain focused on the execution of this strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment. To this end, we sold over $1 billion of CIE portfolio during the quarter and also disposed of $2 billion of private positions. Moving to page 10, Consumer and Wealth Management produced record revenues of $2 billion in the third quarter. In Wealth Management, very strong long-term fee-based inflows for the year-to-date helped drive record management and other fees of $1.2 billion, which was 10% versus the second quarter and 28% year-on-year. Incentive fees of $121 million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds. Private banking and lending revenues of $292 million rose 12% with loans to private wealth clients up $2 billion sequentially. It's demand for lending products remains high amid the low rate environment. I would add that we view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering with room for further growth based on the needs of our clients and our current penetration rates, as well as the strong credit standing of this client base. Consumer banking revenues were $382 million in the quarter, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit balances year-over-year. We expect loan growth to accelerate in 2022, given the pending acquisitions of GreenSky and the General Motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product shed. Looking across these two segments, page 11, shows our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees. We've been building these businesses steadily, and total AUS now stands at a record $2.4 trillion, putting us in the top five of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally. This growth has driven higher firm-wide management and other fees, which rose 16% year-over-year to a record $1.9 billion. On page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the third quarter higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $143 billion up $12 billion sequentially, reflecting increases across the portfolio. Corresponding provision for credit losses of $175 million reflected portfolio growth. On page 13, you see our total quarterly operating expenses of 6.6 billion dollars. Our efficiency ratio for the year-to-date stands at 52.8%, reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a pay-for-performance culture, and investing for growth. Our year-to-date non-compensation expenses were down 17%, but up 11% ex-litigation, while our compensation expenses were up 34% on a year-to-date basis. Turning to capital on Slide 14, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.1% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially. Despite higher capital on solid earnings generation, the decline was driven largely by a $43-billion increase in RWAs, partially reflecting revisions to RWA calculations based on regulatory feedback in the quarter. In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and $700 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns, and then return any excess to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of strong performance, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Additionally, we announced two acquisitions that will enhance both our asset management and consumer businesses, and increase the firm's recurring revenue stream. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set, remains attractive across the firm. As we continue to execute on our strategy, we are building towards a path to sustainable mid-teens returns. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that, especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in a quarter where we produce 22.5% ROE, it's that the reason and consistent with that, that we deploy the capital in the business.  I'd also point out that, in the dividend, our dividend is now at $2 a share, up from $1.25. So on an annual basis, we're returning an additional $1 billion or so to shareholders through the dividend. And where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive will return capital backend that that really represents what we do in terms of share repurchase. Now in terms of the opportunity set, you referred into the consumer business, it's unquestionably a priority. David had reflected time and again, the long-term view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to the firm. But I would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity, it is a broad look across the firm. And we think always about how do we add in an agile way, deploy capital across the whole of the business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that it's targeted against anyone in particular.  Obviously, we're operating at a higher SCB, a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the Fed, therefore, surplus is less. And we, consistent with the policy, always look forward to what will be in effect a petition on capital that we know. SACCR is certainly one of them. And in that regard, while we've not made a formal decision on implementation, and we'll let our regulators know when we do.  We're looking forward to that. And our view is that, when we put SACCR in place, it will increase our RWAs by about $15 billion or tax our ratio by about 30 basis points. It is at that level in part because, as we look back when SACCR was finalized by Basel in '14 and adopted by the Fed in '18 and '19, we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect.  So the implementation now reflects mitigation progress we've made in anticipation of it, as opposed to kind of a starting workstream. And obviously, the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuing through the rules could play out. But I think that's a reflection of a proactive engagement, so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio now, relative to what it would've been. And so -- sorry for the long answer, but that gives you kind of a complete picture, if you will, of how we're thinking about capital. So maybe I start with the numbers and then I'll turn it to David, who I think can reflect on kind of comp philosophy generally. But where we are right now, comp to net revenue, net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through nine months. That was at 34% when we ended the second quarter. We always reserve for compensation, consistent with what's required of us, which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance, as at that date, obviously, there's a quarter to go. So we're at a 31% ratio, revenue net of provision for credit loss.  You can see through nine months in the comp and benefits line, not to confuse the two numbers, that number is up 34%. Again, reflecting the performance of the business and a pay-for-performance philosophy more broadly. That 34% is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up 42% year-to-date and revenues net of provisions up 56%.  So you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we believe to be a healthy and robust comp process. I think overall, if you look at total operating expenses because we look at it that way, including our non-comp expense, there continues to be the exhibition of leverage, operating leverage in the business.  Again, revenue is up 42%, but total operating expenses ex-litigation are up 24%. And so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically. But maybe David wants to comment just on the philosophy. Well, the only thing I'd add, Christian, is if you just look at the year-over-year comparison, right? So you can't forget that we went through kind of a more challenging period in COVID, where we by design look to limit the amount of underwriting we were doing. We're now coming back to sort of turn that back on, having seen the portfolio performed very well.  So year-over-year, revenues and consumer are up 23% in the deposit line. They're up 54% in credit cards. And that's just a reflection of the renewed commitment that David is reflecting to sort of growing out that business and seeing it perform. And I think David's comments are spot on.  If you look at loans and savings and Apple Card, soon to be joined by General Motors, investing module and checking, this is net -- what's coming into focus is a big, broad platform that can serve customers in all of their needs, as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set. And I think we're at a key moment now with the acquisition of GreenSky to sort of take that forward. Hey, good morning. Sure. Let me start with the end part of your question. Our strongly held view is that 13% to 13.5% is the right place for this firm to operate. Now, our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the Fed is otherwise requiring of us in the context of CCAR and SCB. So in that context, what we can do and what we are doing is candidly taking action into our own hands. Meaning, we're not waiting for petitions to be well received in order that the requirement comes down.  But instead, we're pivoting and moving from Balance Sheet into fun format. I think, if you look at the page 9 in our -- in our deck what you'll see is what's happened in terms of $16 billion of dispositions, and what that has meant for AE free up. So I'll just give you a sense of it. In the last 9 months, we've seen reduction in balance sheet of $8.9 billion corresponding to $4.6 billion of AE.  Since Investor Day, $16.2 billion of reduction in balance sheet and $8.3 billion of freed AE. And we have line of sight from where we sit to about $2.8 billion of balance sheet reduction, freeing up about $2 billion of AE. I give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity that's been going on, that will continue.  And we had always focused in on whether or not at Investor Day we would experience a bit of a canyon, if you will, of revenue, meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace. Faster slope than what might have been a yawning line, if you will, to fundraising and deployment. That's not happening.  As David has said, we have $90 billion of fundraising, which -- and underlying that is about $50 billion of AUS, which is fee-paying. And so that transition is being managed well. And this just gives you a sense of the overall capital reduction in the context of what we're trying to achieve. Hey, Jeff. Well, I would say that much of the balance sheet growth that has gone on has been attributed to client activity. If you just look at segment-by-segment, you look at growth in our financing activity in investment banking that supports our M&A franchise.  You look at financing that's going on in the context of both FICC and equities that were up year-on-year and that David was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability on the forward in our trading business. And so a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients. I would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet, it doesn't grow in isolation. Meaning we have various risk metrics that are in place, capital has obviously grown, liquidity maintained at the firm, obviously grows in the form of our GCLA. And so all of these I think are meant to be read in tandem. In the context of serving clients. But doing that in a way, where Balance Sheet growth is, held in the context of various risks. Be it capital and liquidity profile of the Firm itself.  We're not a bank, notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are experiencing the outsized growth in deposits that you're seeing or that you have seen at the bigger commercial banks. And that is inflating Balance Sheet there. We're not seeing that kind of inflation, frankly in part because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very usable deposits as a substitute for wholesale funding. Good morning, Betsy. Hey, Mike. lot of electronification than there is the rest of the Company, where I'm not really sure what the tech backbone is. So the question is, how much has the tech backbone contributed to that higher marginal margin for each the growth areas, trading and the rest of the firm? Yeah, the only thing I'd add was a bit of quantification. So Mike, if you -- you heard me say before, our non-comp expenses, so excluding litigation to just looking at the core non-comp expense, year-to-date is up 11%. If you look at the gross expense that that represents, about a 1/3 of that increase is related to technology.  So we're about a third of the increase of non-compensation expense in the firm through the first 9 months relates to technology. And this is spent all across the firm. so it's both in particular initiatives like consumer TXP McKee (ph) but equally, it's been broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm.  Cloud-based engineering is one that David brought to your attention. In all of these spends, we sweat the ROI of this investment. And so, as an example, part of the uplift will enable us to create greater opportunity for automation, which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm. So I just offer that to you, just to give you some sort of dimension, if you will, from a true expense line as to what David was otherwise describing. So I don't believe that there are GS deposits in it. It's 50 billion of gross deposits. And as we've said, that's now become about 25% operational, so a value to us. But just to come back to your question about the Cloud. So the TXP business was built entirely in the Cloud. I don't know that I would necessarily conclude that that is why it's been successful.  I would conclude, however, that it is how it's been built on a very cost-efficient basis and built with a level of security that I think satisfies us and our client base, meaning I think it's a drop card in the context of it. The reason Mike is self-evident, which is that it's built-in the Cloud, as David noted, it's not built with multiple instances of the transaction banking platform across redundant datacenters.  It benefits without necessarily costing us to improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like. That is the benefit of sitting within the cloud itself. So I can't tell you that I could draw a line to the deposits that have come in. I can tell you that we built it better, cheaper, and on a more attractive basis to facilitate client -attention and attraction to it. Thank you Sure. So we had about $42 billion increase in RWAs -- about half of that related to changes in the methodology that we're using in the computation of the RWAs. And that was the byproduct of just routine and ongoing discussion with regulators. And so that plays through in the third quarter ratio, will play through on the forward.  But that's really the source of about 50% of the RWA lift. The other 50% is obviously in the context of the overall business and risk and exposure that's attending there. Hey, Gerard. Sure. So the targets were set at the same time, though bear in mind the environment then and now is quite different in the context of interest rates. So we've seen fed funds come down from the time of Investor Day. I don't know, I want to say about a 150 basis points, maybe a little more.  The consequence of that is that, the value of deposits that the economic value of deposits is not as rich now, as we had imagined back at Investor Day. But equally in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates, we'll see a return to the value of those deposits, otherwise modeled out. And therefore on the forward rate curve our view is that we'll be able to achieve that billion-dollar revenue target. I point out that of the 50 billion more of them are operational. That's step one to achieving the value of that. And that has been a big quarter-on-quarter increase from about 14% the last quarter. And I think more broadly in transaction banking, about 2/3 of the revenue from the time we modeled through now is correlated to deposit intake with the balance around FX and other fees. And so as we see interest rates come back, the value of those deposits will as well. So since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our Senior Management team, we hope to see many of you in the coming months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth-quarter call in January. Thank you."

I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 13, 2021. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Thank you, Erica. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. David will start with a high-level review of our second quarter performance and our client franchise. He will also provide an update on the operating environment and the macroeconomic backdrop. Stephen will then discuss our second quarter results in detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I will now pass the call over to David. \nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning.  I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a review of our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $15.4 billion, our second highest result on record. The strength, breadth and diversity of our business remained evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $5.5 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $15.02. Second quarter results contributed to our highest ever first half revenues of $33 billion and net earnings of over $12 billion, which drove year-to-date ROE of 27.3% and ROTE of 28.9%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and the constructive but more normalized market environment relative to a year ago. Our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firm\u2019s strategic priorities across all four of our businesses as laid out at our 2020 Investor Day. In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leading M&A franchise. Given this position, we observed certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerge from the pandemic, the drive for scale, the push to achieve operating efficiency, the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set.  We\u2019ve maintained a number one ranking completed M&A for 19 over the last 20 years and have been the leader in equity underwriting for nine of last 10 years. We have broadening our Transaction Banking platform. In June, we launched in the UK and we will now focus on expanding into Japan and other geographies. Although we are early in the rollout, initial client feedback has been quite positive. We delivered solid results in Global Markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance. We continued to deploy balance sheet to support client activity and we are further expanding our means of engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms. A good example is our marquee platform where we are collaborating with MSCI to deliver improved portfolio analytics for our institutional clients versus \u2013 via APIs. In Asset Management, our assets under supervision hit another record of $1.6 trillion as we serve clients by delivering best-in-class investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset classes. We also continue to transition the business to more third-party funds, where we have raised $74 billion in gross commitments across a range of alternative investment strategies since our 2020 Investor Day. Additionally, during the quarter, we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with ICBC, China\u2019s largest bank. The JV will combine our expertise in asset management with ICBC\u2019s extensive access to retail and institutional clients. The partnership is a testament to our longstanding relationship with ICBC and represents a significant opportunity for us to grow internationally. In Consumer and Wealth Management, we are seeing solid inflows in PWM from new and existing clients and ongoing synergies with our Ayco and PFM businesses. We are also advancing on our vision of creating the leading digital consumer banking platform, where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues to be very high. This quarter, we launched Apple Card Family, which allows co-owners on the same account to build credit together as equals. In addition, as we grow markets invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services, we are building a more comprehensive consumer banking offering.  All in the progress on our strategic priorities, combined with our continued execution, reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and increasing durability of our revenues. Reflecting this confidence, our Board of Directors declared a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2 a share. This follows an increase of over 50% in 2019. Taken together, we have increased the dividend by 150% since I took my seat as CEO. While future increases won\u2019t necessarily be of this magnitude, we continue to prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy.  With that, let me now turn to the operating environment on Page 2. It\u2019s clear that we are in the middle of the significant economic rebound. This is particularly true in countries like the U.S. and China, driven by the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs. The broader economic improvement has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and in the United States, the prospect of further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending.  A quarter ago, I mentioned my concerns about the prospect of the U.S. economy overheating. But recent commentary from the Federal Reserve indicates that the central bank is focused on this risk, which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be transitory and then any resulting risks could be adequately managed. From here, I remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence. The delta variant, should it spread further, could spear policy actions with slow economic growth. We are already seeing this play out in places like Hong Kong and Australia and potentially in parts of Europe.  While vaccine take-up is progressing, it is not consistent across communities and nations, including parts of the United States. Widespread vaccine distribution and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies. I want to urge policymakers, government officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts. At Goldman Sachs, we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in the United States, Hong Kong and India among other locations, building on the support we are providing communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic.  More broadly as risk managers, we closely monitor developments and retain \u2013 remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the challenges associated with COVID. Right now, the geopolitical landscape, most notably China and cybersecurity are top of mind. As always, we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an ever-changing market backdrop. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. Our Investment Banking backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with corporate client \u2013 with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery. While consumer confidence may prove more volatile, as supplemental benefits expire in the U.S., corporate clients remained steadfast in their efforts to emerge stronger from the pandemic. In our Markets business, ongoing client engagement and increased market share have strengthened our competitive positioning, notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative to a year ago. And across our investing businesses, the current rate environment and search for yield are driving demand for both institutional and individual investors for our world-class scaled investment platform. Before I turn it over to Stephen, I\u2019d like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of Goldman Sachs. We are an incredibly dedicated and resilient team and I am so proud of how we\u2019ve worked tirelessly to serve our clients and with the challenges over the last 18 months.  Again and again, I\u2019ve heard from our clients that they say Goldman Sachs stay ahead of the curves and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever. Speaking of that, as many of you know, we formally welcomed our colleagues in New York, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Hong Kong and other locations to office this summer.  With roughly 50% of our people in these offices back on a regular basis, I can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating. We recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic and we\u2019ll continue to provide our colleagues with the support they need.  Going forward, we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which we operate. I\u2019ve heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the office and clients appreciate that we are showing up. We\u2019ve always given our people the flexibility they need to manage their professional and personal lives and we will continue to do so.  That said, I believe bringing us back together, forging the close bond to support a culture of collaboration has renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive. I am particularly excited to see nearly 5,800 interns and new hires who are joining us this summer, many in person working side-by-side with long-tenured professionals of Goldman Sachs. I\u2019ll close by saying I am very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. I am especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop.  Importantly, we are making progress in executing our strategy, and I believe we are on a path to sustainable mid-teens returns.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr : Thank you, David, and good morning. I will start with our business performance by segment beginning on Page 4.  Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion. Financial Advisory revenues of $1.3 billion reflected an elevated number of deal closings in the quarter and increasing market position of our business as we have expanded our client footprint.  We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $975 billion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 33%. Activity continues to be strong across geographies, particularly in the Americas with strength across all industry groups reflecting the breadth of our franchise.  Underwriting performance remained very strong with its second highest quarterly revenues following on from a record performance in the first quarter. Equity underwriting performance in particular, continued to be strong, generating $1.2 billion in revenues amid elevated IPO activity and representing our third consecutive quarter with revenues of over $1 billion.  We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in the first half climbing to $85 billion across 400 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%, up 40 basis points versus full year 2020. Notably, we led over 160 IPOs for the year-to-date, more than all of last year. In Debt Underwriting net revenues were $950 million with performance supported by strong high-yield volumes and importantly, robust acquisition financing activity including LBOs, as well as strong M&A and financial sponsor activity. This performance reflects the integrated nature of our Financing and Advisory businesses, as well as our dominant share in financial sponsor activity.  Additionally, ESG remained a focus of the market, particularly in Europe with strong issuance volumes across sustainability-linked bonds and loans. We expect this trend to continue in future quarters. Notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year, as David noted, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity, as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Corporate Lending results of $159 million reflect revenues from Transaction Banking and Middle Market and Relationship Lending, net of approximately $130 million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the relationship loan book.  Transaction Banking is performing well. The business is approaching 300 clients, generating roughly $40 billion in deposits with an increasing percentage becoming operational. Moving to Global Markets on Page 5, segment net revenues were $4.9 billion in the quarter, driven by solid client activity and a generally supportive market making environment. Our franchise continued to exhibit strength across both FICC and equities, notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced significant dislocation and volatility driving elevated client volumes.  We remain focused on building upon recent market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment. Beginning with FICC on Page 6, second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion. In rates, performance was impacted by spread compression, amid lower volatility, though activity remained high with a number of macroeconomic cross currents, around economic recovery and inflation.  In Commodities, we saw solid performance across our increasingly diversified business with contributions from oil, natural gas and power, Ags and metals and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows. In Mortgages, strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business, offset by lower results in agency mortgages. The business continues to diversify its revenue across market making, loan origination and financing.  Across both credit and currencies, lower volatility, more muted volumes and spread compression led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters though market share gains helped offset the effects of a relatively subdued trading environment.  FICC financing revenues of $423 million were driven by mortgage lending, offset by lower repo performance. Moving to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion as we actively deployed our balance sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $1.8 billion with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives.  In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low touch channels and in derivatives, we saw solid performance in EMEA following a more orderly market in European dividends relative to a year ago and stronger results in structured products across geographies. Equities Financing revenues of $815 million were strong given record average balances in our prime business. Growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and new clients. While growth in equities financing remains a strategic priority, we nonetheless maintain a very disciplined focus on risk management, pricing and structural terms of engagement. Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the second quarter, we generated record revenues of $5.1 billion. Management and other fees totaled $727 million, which rose year-on-year, despite approximately $160 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. These waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with industry practice in this rate environment. Incentive fees for the quarter was $78 million. Equity investments produced record net gains of $3.7 billion, amid a supportive market backdrop, particularly in growth equity, which drove roughly one-third of these revenues. The growth equity business has a 15-year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is focused exclusively on investments in growth-stage, technology-driven companies spanning multiple industries. Let me break down the results more specifically. On our $4 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $900 million, driven by market appreciation on investments including Privia Health, KnowBe4 and Flywire. We will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit.  Across our $17 billion private equity book, we\u2019ve generated gains of $2.8 billion from various positions, more than two-thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in Oncoclinicas, a Brazilian oncology business; Sterling, a provider of screening solutions; and Zipwhip, a messaging software firm. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our portfolio consolidated investment entities.  Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $610 million, driven by NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. These gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. On Page 8, we show the composition of our diversified asset management balance sheet consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Staying with Asset Management, let me turn to Page 9. We included this page in today\u2019s earnings presentation to provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments in Asset Management over the first half of the year. This is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business.  The message on the page is simple, while the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased modestly since the end of last year, we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and IPOs of roughly $5.5 billion.  These dispositions have been largely offset by mark-ups on the portfolio of approximately $5 billion, given the supportive market backdrop mentioned, as well as modest additions to the balance sheet, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. So while the balance sheet is slightly higher, we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions year-to-date is approximately $4 billion. And at this stage, we have line of sight on roughly $3 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to over $1 billion of capital reduction.  As noted earlier, we will continue to pursue this disposition activity, particularly given treatment of on-balance sheet equity investments under CCAR. Moving to Page 10, Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Wealth Management revenues of $1.4 billion included record management and other fees of $1.1 billion as assets under supervision increased to $672 billion.  Private Banking and Lending revenues were $260 million with loans to private wealth clients up $4 billion sequentially, consistent with our growth objectives. We remained focused on synergies between our PFM and PWM franchises where we continue to see referrals, representing a significant AUS opportunity.  Consumer Banking revenues were $363 million in the quarter reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card loans. The low-rate environment, as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past 15 months continues to impact the business, though forward growth should help to offset this. Next, let\u2019s turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees.  Total AUS increased to a record $2.3 trillion during the quarter. The sequential increase of $101 billion was driven by $22 billion of long-term inflows, $16 billion of liquidity inflows and $63 billion of market appreciation. Our firm-wide management and other fees grew by 13% versus the second quarter of 2020 to a record $1.8 billion. On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the second quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest earning assets. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $131 billion, up $10 billion sequentially, driven by Wealth Management and Residential Real Estate Warehouse Lending, as well as Apple Card.  Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $92 million, which includes a reserve reduction, driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop, partially offset by portfolio growth. As the credit environment remains benign, we expect loan growth to accelerate in coming quarters consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm. Let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $8.6 billion and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense discipline while investing for growth.  Our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at 34%, though compensation expense increased year-over-year, reflecting strong results, in line with our pay-for-performance culture. Non-compensation expenses were down 43% versus last year due to significantly lower litigation cost. Excluding the impact of litigation, non-compensation was up approximately 6% relative to top-line growth of 16% as increases in transaction base and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to investment entities.  We remained focused on the $1.3 billion expense efficiency target announced at Investor Day. As we noted at a recent industry conference, we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the medium term, which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.8%. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% and we\u2019ll monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. Turning to our balance sheet and capital on Slide 14. On June 28th, we disclosed the Federal Reserve\u2019s indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.4%, which implies a Common Equity Tier 1 requirement of 13.4% effective October 1.  As David mentioned, we also announced an increase in our dividend to $2 per share. While our expectation of the Federal Reserve stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our SCB, the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of our businesses.  In light of our most recent SCB, we recognized that our standardized CET1 ratio will remain elevated for this CCAR cycle and achieving our target in the medium term, by definition will be more challenging. That said, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We have prioritized deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of earnings and then returning any excess to shareholders via share repurchases.  In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and approximately $440 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm, we lowered our stock repurchases in the quarter. Our book value per share rose to a record $264.90, up 6% sequentially. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, 7% higher versus last quarter. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $329 billion. On the liabilities side, our total deposits rose to $306 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter and our long-term debt also rose by $20 billion, driven by $18 billion of benchmark issuance. Let me just spend a moment on funding. As we noted on our Fixed Income Call in May, our year-to-date benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year contrary to our intention at the start of the year, but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm.  We expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring non-bank funding persist, albeit at a more moderate pace than the $38 billion issued in the first half. Nonetheless, we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher utilization of deposit funding globally.  To that end, we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank entities to facilitate more activity in the U.S. bank bringing our banks to nearly 30% of the firm-wide balance sheet. In conclusion, we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm. Given strategic progress and recent performance, we are confident around our medium-term return targets with a path to sustainable mid-teens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. \nGlenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. A quick follow-up. You noted the record prime brokerage, prime financing balances and curious if you could drill down a little bit on how much is environment versus - and engagement of clients versus new clients and market share gains? And while we are on the topic, I\u2019d love to know, if you have any thoughts following the Archegos incident. What has or do you expect to change in the industry as a result? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks a lot, Glenn. So on prime balances, they have grown. They\u2019ve grown kind of consistent with the broader strategy that we set up. As to distinguish that growth between the environment and clients, I would say it\u2019s both. I would say the environment obviously by virtue of balance is accreting in this market, that has grown balances and we\u2019ve obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients and, frankly speaking, to be more profound with our existing ones. But I would tell you that in the context of all of that, and I mentioned this in the script, there is a clear screen, which looks at where we are pricing, how we are structuring terms, both around new entrants and equally around the back book of our prime balances. And so, we are being rather judicious in the context of what we bring to assure that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view, but it is both environment and clients and our ambition is to take that share up, but to do it in a rather prudent way. On the part of your question relating to Archegos, look, this has obviously gathered kind of an investigative purview from a number of geographies and across regulators. Kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or what that yields.  I suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure, both of which we would be supportive of, there will be moves by regulators to achieve that. But very hard to say, kind of, as to where that all plays out. As we shared in our first quarter earnings call, we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of regulatory and industry change that will come about.\nGlenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just to follow up on\u2026\nDavid Solomon: Sure. \nGlenn Schorr : \u2026on two of the new business builds. You mentioned the Family Card with Apple. I am curious on \u2013 in what customer segment you are going after with that? And maybe a bigger question on, do you have any numbers for us in terms of accounts balances or new partners who want to talk about? And maybe that same comment question for transaction banking clients, deposits, just tracking progress, I appreciate it. Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So, progress on both fronts has been considerable. I would say, let\u2019s start with Apple Card. The press around creating the family plan was frankly speaking to achieve a greater and more positive user experience. So that people across a family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting, broadly speaking. I think that move will accelerate share. But I think more importantly, and its objective was to create just a better overall user experience. On Apple Card, generally, I would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of COVID, we\u2019ve seen the credit profile of Apple Card customers to prove positive, perhaps even more positive than we thought.  And we\u2019ve now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth consistent with the tone of the consumer market that we are seeing. And I think there is more opportunities to be had with Apple using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set. So, you\u2019ll start to see forward growth, and I suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increase in originations and underwriting in Apple Card and the family plan will only serve to help that.  In transaction banking, that business continues to grow. We are upwards of now several hundred clients, $40 billion of deposits. And perhaps most importantly, when you look at that deposit base, we are starting to see an acceleration of operational deposits approaching 15%. And that\u2019s obviously the linchpin to creating a deposit base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm. I will tell you based on our opening expectations of that business, we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers. It\u2019s turning out that the user interface and the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what we are offering by way of experience and technology is proving to be the winning ticket.  And so, as both David and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are going to start to see geographic expansion both to the UK and Japan. We\u2019ve set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities. And so, I think that business will continue to play forward.  And perhaps what\u2019s most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the One GS mantra and the way in which we are able to sell in through an existing client base.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu : Good morning, David and Stephen. Maybe just start off with the equity investments portfolio and thanks very much for the roll forward of Slide 9. I guess I have a two-parter on that slide. It\u2019s a high-class problem, but you sold nearly $6 billion in positions and you made basically no progress in reducing the equity investment portfolio. So, curious what else you can do to bring that portfolio down? And then, maybe more broadly, is it time to rethink the sort of disposition strategy? Your stock is at all-time highs. The market is rewarding your stock for strong revenue growth and ROE expansion and they don\u2019t really care about capital position. So, I mean, should you just not just cut the buybacks, focus on revenue growth, rather than potentially making uneconomic investment dispositions?\nDavid Solomon: So, thanks, Christian. We appreciate the question. And on the first part of the question, we absolutely have made progress on our goal with respect to capital efficiency and the on-balance sheet investing. And I\u2019ll let Stephen highlight some of the details in the moment \u2013 at the moment. But we continue to move aggressively to manage those positions. I think it\u2019s a very constructive environment for us to do so and I think we\u2019ll continue to do that. You\u2019ll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions.  We continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more durable and recurring revenues and the fee-based emphasis of the fundraising that we are doing in the asset management business is one aspect of that.  On the broader question about opportunity, I think one of the reasons why we decrease our buyback in the quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business. And so, if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner, we will continue to do it, but we want to remain and I think we\u2019ve always been a very, very nimble capital allocator. And so, when we see those opportunities, we will make investments and we\u2019ll continue to grow the business. If for some reason the environment changes and we don\u2019t, we will return that capital appropriately to shareholders. Stephen, do you want to comment just on the progress along those sell-downs, because we have made real targeted progress and we\u2019ll continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals we\u2019ve set out.\nStephen Scherr: Yes. So, I guess, let\u2019s just start kind of with the facts. Obviously, on the new page that we showed you, $5.5 billion did come off-balance sheet producing $4 billion of capital relief. And as I mentioned, there is another $3 billion that\u2019s in sight to take $1 billion of capital down. Now, that just looks narrowly speaking at the private equity portfolio. There is consolidated investment entities. There are debt positions, all of which are on-balance sheet, all of which are subject to further reduction, all of which will reduce down capital. Now why does that matter and why we want to stick to that strategy, Christian, as opposed to kind of abandon it? Well, first of all, obviously, we are looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm. The one way to do that is to influence the denominator. The way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more broadly. At the same time, this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm, which is that moving from on-balance sheet to fund format and the fact that we\u2019ve raised since Investor Day, $75 billion of new funds in those funds, okay? We\u2019ll increase assets under supervision and equally we\u2019ll increase fee revenue that\u2019s being generated by those investments in that fund format.  And so, in a way the page to watch on the forward will be Page 11 of our Investor Day presentation, because what\u2019s going to play out and we promise more disclosure which we will deliver, but firm-wide assets under supervision will go up. Firm-wide management and other fees will go up. Those will prove to be more durable and predictable and I think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of businesses.  And I think that\u2019s the broader picture if you will in terms of what we are trying to achieve. What we put on Page 9 was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made much as it would otherwise be masked by as you put it kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of on-balance sheet investments. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak : Hi, good morning. \nDavid Solomon: Good morning, Steve. \nSteven Chubak : I wanted to start off with a question just on the investment banking outlook. First half revenue is a record. You started the record backlog or closing continued strong share gains.  One of the interesting metrics that was provided recently by John at a recent conference was that, you sell $1.7 billion benefit just from share gains in global markets and just given some of the momentum in the investment banking side, I didn\u2019t know if you could help frame how much of a revenue benefit you are seeing from those share gains and is there any risk to the \u2013 sort of disruption in the current environment, especially given the Biden Executive Order that was recently published? \nDavid Solomon: Sure. So, a couple of thoughts on that broadly. I mean, the environment for investment banking activity, Steven, continues to be very, very constructive. And I think that there is a good chance that that will continue to play forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues.  In my remarks, I highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic there were a handful of factors that we think are structurally driving CEOs and Boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an increasingly evolving digital world.  And we are seeing really, really broad engagement across our franchise with respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go-forward basis. And the world that\u2019s actually evolving quite quickly, I am encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high record levels and a lot of that I think feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment.  Obviously, if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn\u2019t seem likely given where we are positioned today. With respect to global markets, we picked up a 160 basis points of market share through quarter one and that\u2019s allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us.  I don\u2019t have specific market share KPIs on investment banking to share right on this call, we can certainly follow-up more broadly on some things. Obviously, we tracked our \u2013 we track our lead table position both in M&A and equity and debt and there, we\u2019ve been strengthening our position over time and it\u2019s consistently at the top of those lead tables. What I do say is affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our Investor Day process to serve a broader array of clients was to really expand that footprint and the footprint of available clients let\u2019s say are in the $500 million to $3 billion enterprise value has been significant.  It\u2019s grown and we\u2019ve continued to expand that footprint and we\u2019re quite effective at penetrating that. And so that\u2019s been a very good opportunity for us and I actually think that opportunity will continue. I think our Investment Banking business is positioned incredibly well. I think we continue as we have been to be a leader in that business over the course of the last decades and the quality of the talent we have in that business continues to be strong, differentiated and very, very front-footed with our clients. And so, there certainly could be macro events over 12, 24, 36 months period that slowed down the current momentum, but at the moment, it feels quite constructive.\nSteven Chubak : Thanks for all that color, David and just for my follow-up, relating to the line of questioning tied to Christian\u2019s question just on the equity investment portfolio, recognizing that barring a net reduction in that portfolio, understanding there is other metrics we have to monitor, it might be difficult to really see any meaningful SCB improvement at least in the near-term.  I was hoping to get some perspective just given the multiple re-rating that you\u2019ve seen, the strong momentum in the business, as well as the fact that the SCB is feeling some upward pressure, whether your views on a transformational M&A are evolving at all and whether a potential acquisition could at least tell potentially mitigate some of the pressures from the global market shock that seem to be driving that upward pressure on the capital ratio.\nDavid Solomon : At a high level and I appreciate the question, Steven, I don\u2019t think our views on transformational M&A have evolved. Call-after-call, quarter-after-quarter I\u2019ve said and I\u2019ll say again that the bar would always be extremely high for us to do something very, very significant.  But I\u2019ve also said that our drive to diversify our revenues and create more durable revenues comes, as both Stephen and I have highlighted in our remarks, from continuing to invest in and grow our Asset Management business, continuing to invest in and grow the opportunity in our Wealth Management business and for broadening our digital Consumer Banking platform. There may be opportunities from time-to-time that can accelerate the direction of travel in those. We look at things constantly. If we see things that could accelerate the direction of travel in those businesses and accelerate our goals in those businesses, we\u2019ll certainly consider them always \u2013 always with a high bar.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise you that prices at the moment are high and that certainly has an impact on how we think about these things. But we are making a lot of progress organically and we continue to be focused on that organic growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning.\nStephen Scherr : Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck : Just as an incremental follow-up on everything you just said, David, how do we think about the sizing of the equity investment book that you are looking for? I totally get that mark-ups are adding to this right now. But the $1.5 billion in addition, there is lots of great opportunities out there. Should we expect that over time the equity investments book should be rising? Or is there a goal of size of this portfolio that you are looking to manage to over the next call it, two to three years?\nDavid Solomon : Well, the strategy \u2013 the strategy has been to take a broad Asset Management business and particularly around alternatives that has been extremely balance sheet heavy and turn it into more of a fund-based model and we\u2019ve only started to really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly.  And as Stephen highlighted, since our Investor Day, we\u2019ve raised $75 billion in fund structure. I think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds, we invest as GP alongside our institutional investors and so there will always be equity investments through our fund participation, but the cycle that we are going through is one of shifting from significant on-balance sheet investments over time to a much broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller and therefore the overall equity position will be meaningfully smaller than it\u2019s been. Now it\u2019s a good problem if the market keeps going up and therefore the value seems to be staying the same even though we are making very, very significant sales. But over time, as we continue to grow the funds portion of the business and we continue on the path of disposing, that number will get smaller. We haven\u2019t put out a target number, but by definition, it will get smaller. In the near-term, our balance sheet will come down and our AE target is a little less than $18 billion.\nStephen Scherr : The only other thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that if you look at Page 8 in the presentation, on the left-hand side, you can see we\u2019ve been talking a lot about the $21 billion of equity investments. But equally consolidated investment entities of $18 billion is fertile ground to continue to bring this down and reduce down the AE in the segment.  And so, all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go. Obviously, the objective or the near-term target as it were of AE of getting down to $18 billion or lower remains that and we are committed to get to it notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio, because as you rightly point out, that also presents opportunity to accelerate where we can the sell-down of these positions.\nBetsy Graseck : Right, because I should be thinking about the $21 billion in terms of density of capital usage, kind of the old methodology when you were 25% invested in these funds to new which is more like 3% or less invested in the funds. So obviously, the latter is less capital-intensive.  I guess, the other question is, in addition to Page 8, left-hand side that you mentioned, are there other things we should be thinking about for bringing the SCB down? Or would you say, hey look, Page 8 left-hand side, that\u2019s really the bulk of the actions that we are interested in taking?\nStephen Scherr : Well, look, I think, the way to think about this is that, we are not waiting for the Fed to deliver us a result that\u2019s satisfactory, okay, much as we are petitioning them on some issues that are relevant. We are taking a lot of self-help here.  We\u2019ve been talking about one, the overall push to durable revenues, right, is going to factor into the way in which the Fed determines PPNR in the context of the overall SCB calculation. So it\u2019s not just limited to this. It means, what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated, as David spoke about and I did of $75 billion and growing in fund format.  What does it mean in the context of a growing consumer business? What does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction banking? All of these will prove to be more durable, viewed that way presumably by the Fed to yield a better PPNR sort of calculation in the overall test. So we are not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of considerable consequence in the way in which CCAR treats on balance sheet investing.  And then, again, we remain quite engaged with the Fed, as we put our letter in last year and we will only serve to reinforce those issues this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower SCB calculation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about M&A. The advisory business in banking and Stephen touched on this, but maybe I wanted to be a bit more explicit. So, we\u2019ve seen a bit more hawkishness on the anti-trust side, not only with the recent Executive Order, but also with some of the actions tied to certain deals.  What kind of an impact do you expect this might happen \u2013 have on volumes and velocity in the M&A market broadly? And I believe you touched on the fact that sponsor activity was a big \u2013 has been a big contributor to M&A volume. How much of that sponsor activity you get the sense is driven by some kind of tax motivation given all the talk about the potential for rising taxes? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon : Sure. And I am going to answer the second \u2013 I am going to answer the second part first. And then I\u2019ll circle back on the Executive Order and kind of the broader \u2013 the broader roadmap around M&A. But I don\u2019t think the sponsor activity is driven by tax. The sponsor business at this point is a broad, diverse business. There is enormous dry powder.  There is an enormous amount of money that moves in that ecosystem. There is real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to increase the waiting to alternatives. It\u2019s one of the reasons why the strategy we are focused as one of the leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that, because there is lots of demand for our clients.  And so, I don\u2019t think that there is any overlay from a tax perspective that\u2019s accelerating activity there. I do think that activity has accelerated, because the market environment is quite constructive and it\u2019s been quite a constructive environment for asset prices generally. With respect to the broad M&A environment and anti-trust and the Executive Order, I mean, obviously, the Executive Order I think serves the roadmap for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current administration would like to get done over the next four years that relate broadly to competition, consumer protection issues.  This is \u2013 it\u2019s a broad and ambitious range of ideas. It\u2019s something that I think we\u2019ll have to watch very, very closely. Ultimately, the order can\u2019t direct the agencies that make the anti-trust decisions to make those decisions. But it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact.  But the agencies will have to over time, put forward or through the actions they take create more transparency on that. We\u2019ll be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies. Certainly, I think there is a tipping in the balance that could in the margin have some impact on certain transactions.  I\u2019d certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation. There will certainly be a lot of discussion in that area. But I think it\u2019s early and I think you have to watch it closely and I think the macro environment and the tailwinds from the macro environment, some of the things I said earlier about companies\u2019 desire is to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay, but we are going to have to watch that very carefully.\nBrennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color, David. And then, for my second question, there has been a lot of press coverage recently around junior banking \u2013 junior banker frustration, and we\u2019ve seen some competitors increase comp for the junior levels as a result. Do you think any of those developments will impact retention at Goldman? And do you have any specific plans or intentions to respond to this development yourselves? And what kind of impact do you think that might have? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon : Sure, sure, sure Brennan. I appreciate the question. And as we\u2019ve highlighted earlier in the call, we are quite proud of our leading Investment Banking franchise. It\u2019s been a leading franchise for decades and I think one of the primary reasons it\u2019s been a leading franchise is because of the quality of the people that we are able to attract and retain at Goldman Sachs, we serve our clients and serve our clients extraordinarily well.  We have always paid very competitively. We have always been a pay-for-performance organization. We are performing. We have a normal pay cycle. For analysts that normal pay cycle happens to be in August and we\u2019ll continue to pay competitively and pay-per-performance, but that\u2019s part of our strategy that\u2019s been in place for a long time and will obviously continue. With respect to salaries, we revaluate salaries in regular course every single year and when appropriate, we make sure our salaries are competitive. So, we continue to thrive by having the best people here and paying them appropriately especially when we perform, we are performing. And I would tell you to expect to see us pay appropriately during our normal cycle.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo : Hi.\nDavid Solomon : Hey, Mike.\nStephen Scherr : Hey, Mike.\nMike Mayo : So, it looks like revenues and profits per employee are up over the last year, last five years, even while you\u2019ve grown employees 4% year-over-year and 17% over five years. So, I think what would be sustainable is if you are lowering unit cost and generating revenues for lower marginal costs. So my question is, how much has technology helped you to lower unit cost? And how much more is ahead?  And from the outside, there is no way we can compute that. You have private equity gains. You have a lot of moving parts. But on the inside of the firm, I imagine you are tracking those in some manner.\nDavid Solomon : I\u2019ll start and Stephen will add, Mike. But at a high level - and we\u2019ve talked about this. We\u2019ve talked about efficiency in the firm. We\u2019ve talked about digitization. We\u2019ve talked about connectivity to our clients and ways the technology can leverage our ability to serve our clients, all that continues.  And there is a significant investment going into that making the firm more efficient, but most importantly, levering our people\u2019s capabilities to better serve our clients. I think that we are in the third inning of that evolution. There is more opportunity. But there have been some real gains.  And Stephen can probably quantify on some basis how we think about that. But I think there is a lot more opportunity for us to continue through digitization and the way we connect with our clients and the tools we use to create more leverage broadly. And so, we continue to be focused on that. Stephen?\nStephen Scherr : Yes. Mike, the way we look at it and compute it is, we look at the introduction of technology into a variety of different work streams. Take risk for example, where there is mandatory production of tens of thousands of reports, either by regulators or consumption internally and we go through a zero-based budgeting exercise where we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays forward. When I think about the forward for the firm, the real cost gains are going to happen and the production of higher marginal margins are going to play out by virtue of the achievement of scale. When we achieve scale in certain of these businesses, take Transaction Banking, take the Consumer business, even look at what we do in platforms like PFM, okay, we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because we\u2019ve got an embedded base that is built to scale.  And those businesses will scale over time, over the medium to long-term and the effect of unit cost, if you will of producing what we do will come down. And so that\u2019s just a sense both in the spot, zero-based budgeting, risk, et cetera, but equally on the forward in terms of how to think about the achievement of scale and higher marginal margin in the business.\nMike Mayo : And as it relates to the Executive Order from the White House with you guys positioned as a potential disruptor in the Consumer business, what do you make and what are the possibilities for you to benefit from making it easier to transport customer data from bank-to-bank?\nStephen Scherr : Well, I would say couple of things. I mean, one is to repeat what David said, which is, it\u2019s a bit early. Right, now what we came to the issuance of the Executive Order is to exactly how that plays, okay? From our perspective, we started this consumer business on a white sheet of paper. So we are not retrofitting a series of transactions or incumbent businesses.  And so, as we look to continue to build the consumer platform, we are quite open to the notion that there will be shared set of data. The data will be portable. Our focus has been entirely from the customer back, which is what does the customer want? What is the customer need in the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform? And so, these products are all about the design, utilization of data.  We obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren, which is, we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount. We are no different than any other bank. We take that responsibility seriously. But I think on the new build, on a white sheet of paper, we are less burdened by these issues, less protective of an incumbent business and more focused on where we can take it and where we can build.\nDavid Solomon : Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that, Mike, is that, when we started building this business four, five years ago, it\u2019s certainly within our vision of the world that customers would have a lot more flexibility to move their data and attach to different platforms. And so, certainly in our macro design of where we think the world is going, the direction of travel that way is not something surprising to us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get a bit of an update on the expense efficiency initiatives that you\u2019ve laid out and kind of where the progress sits today and the breakout of kind of non-comp versus comp on a go-forward basis.  And then secondly, if you could also update us on the funding optimization goals that you have, I think the goal of 30 basis point improvement over time. Can you just update us on where that sits today?\nStephen Scherr : Yes, sure. Okay. So let me take the three pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that and you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confidence to about $400 million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the 2022 timeline that we set for the achievement of the $1.3 billion.  So confident in the existing number and giving an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there. Again, all of this consistent actually with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people. And so, that\u2019s where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives. In terms of comp and non-comp and the forward, let me say this. On compensation, as David has indicated, we have always been in a pay-for-performance mode. We\u2019ll continue to be that. As the firm performs, we will continue to sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent.  I will say, as we said in the past on compensation, that the compensation as sort of a call out component to operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these scale businesses. And so, therefore, you\u2019ll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we have historically been rather pre-occupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself.  That\u2019s lesser reflection of any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent. It is more to do with the composition of businesses that we are building and the kind of non-comp intensity of expenses related to it. On non-comp expense, I would say, we have in virtually every one of the recent quarter has been quite focused on ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business. That is, our non-comp expense normalized for kind of excessive one-off litigation or the like, trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top-line of the firm.  So this quarter, as I noted, while the as reported non-comp expense is down about 43%, that\u2019s influenced very heavily by the $2.9 billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year. When you look at it like-for-like, our non-comp expense is up 6% against the 16% top-line revenue growth. I think that should be a guidepost for how we are going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward. On the third question you asked about funding optimization, here I would say, we are \u2013 we remain committed and confident in the achievement of the $1 billion in funding optimization. Bear in mind that as I spoke about increased non-deposit funding or increased wholesale funding, the overall funding mix or the funding taken in total for the firm is going up.  It\u2019s going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm and as much as we grow non-bank or wholesale funding, we are equally growing the deposit base. We are doing that now at a lower price point than where we were before. It\u2019s indicative of NII growing in the firm. And so, we are confident that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and take us to $1 billion of runrate savings within the timeframe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan : Great. Good morning, David, and Stephen.\nDavid Solomon : Hey, Devin.\nStephen Scherr : Good morning.\nDevin Ryan : Wanted to quickly follow-up on Transaction Banking and just trying to better understand some of the traction just given such strong growth in the quarter. And what I\u2019d like to dig in a little bit is around, the 300 clients that you mentioned, do you have any kind of the wallet share that you are seeing?  And what I\u2019m getting at is, are clients I guess currently just testing your platform, and so there is kind of maybe significant embedded potential as those clients move more balances over? So, any flavor for that? And then, there seem to like success is going to beget more success here as proof-of-concept has obviously been established.  And so, just any other color on kind of what you are seeing in the sales process and then whether there is an acceleration in bringing new customers on now that it\u2019s fully established?\nStephen Scherr : Sure, Devin. So, I would say, the process of sell-through here is better in terms of rate of growth than we anticipated, but the way in which it\u2019s happening is as we anticipated, which is that, we are not new to any one of the corporates who are coming on to this platform. There is a longstanding corporate relationship that has opened the door.  We had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable business, we recognize that there was a progression where you have large corporates that have a platform of three or four participating banks that our breaking point was to be number three or four and this wasn\u2019t conditioned on us jumping to the number one spot on that platform out of the box. Now, my view is that, as treasurers and CFOs grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on the platform, we will grow. We will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the Transaction Banking platform and we will see our ranking, if you will, on that platform grow.  If we began at three or four, we\u2019ll see ourselves to two and perhaps one. And that will continue to sort of grow and expand. But these are formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm so that sell-through is, as we expected, perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth and that\u2019s kind of the progression. I would also say that that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the $40 billion growing that we will see, because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business, percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational. Therefore more valuable.  And so, that I think is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it were for any given corporate client.\nDevin Ryan : Okay. Very helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nDavid Solomon : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala : Good morning.\nDavid Solomon : Good morning.\nStephen Scherr : Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala : I guess, I just wanted to follow-up on your outlook around your mid-teens ROE target. You\u2019ve talked, David, and a lot about the revenue durability and reducing the capital density, both of which should eventually be accretive to the ROE profile. But when you look at how the market values the stock today, I think there is some skepticism around where the ROE could be if there is a downturn in the cycle.  Just talk to us, if you could, in your view, where do you think the firm is over-earning versus under-earning from an ROE standpoint? And what\u2019s the net-net outcome of those jobs?\nDavid Solomon : Well, I think broadly speaking, we are performing very well across a very, very diverse platform of businesses. Certainly, I can\u2019t predict the future. This certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow vis-a-vis the levels of activity we are seeing today.  On the other hand, at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity, there are also parts of our business that performed quite well and have some counter-cyclicality. So, I think we have a big at scale business. We are at scale and a number of our businesses and a leader. I think those businesses will continue through the cycle to produce very, very good returns.  I think we are building other businesses that as Stephen highlighted are going to be scaling. Some of them are different kinds of businesses, but they offer opportunity for more consistent modelable, more consistent returns that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable. I believe that our business activities are durable through the cycle and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it. And so, I believe if we continue to do that over time, the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way others and our peers are valued should narrow. But we are going to continue to focus on serving our clients, growing these businesses, expanding the platforms and my belief is the market will follow.\nStephen Scherr : I mean, to some extent, if you reflect on David\u2019s comments, ROE is nothing, but numerator over denominator. And so, we\u2019re controlling both revenue in-take and expense in the context of the numerator and equally working hard to do what we can of our own volition to reduce down the denominator in the context of SCB.  But, the reality is, we sit where we sit. We are changing kind of the dynamic of the business profile all to yield a higher ROE, which will translate, as David suggested into the potential for a much better look at the valuation of the firm overall.\nDavid Solomon : And I just add broadly, the kind of environment that obviously affects our returns, certainly when you look historically, it\u2019s affected other of our peer institutions\u2019 returns too. There are differences in our business. But I don\u2019t think they are as different as they are amplified from time-to-time.\nEbrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just as a follow-up on the consumer strategy. Can you achieve significant scale over the next few years without doing something inorganic? Or do you think you can build out and without having to do any meaningful M&A and still create a sizable business in a reasonable timeframe?\nDavid Solomon : We absolutely think that we can build an at-scale business over the course of the next three to five years without doing something on organic. If we saw something that we thought could accelerate that or enhance that, we\u2019d certainly consider it. But we have a detailed plan that gives us what we think is a scalable, which is an at-scale significant business over the next five years.  And we are going to continue to invest and continue to execute against it. And as we\u2019ve said a number of times, those investments and that drive to do that is not affecting our either mid or slightly longer-term return targets and thresholds that we continue to drive towards.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor : Good morning.\nDavid Solomon : Good morning.\nStephen Scherr : Good morning.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor : So, there has been an acceleration of the electronification effect. There was a good article, I think over the weekend on this specifically within credit. And I was wondering if you could talk a bit about this. And I know you\u2019ve invested a lot in the technology side on both sides of trading. But how does this kind of shape up for you in terms of thinking about your share going forward assuming this trend continues.\nStephen Scherr : So, in the context of our credit business in FICC, this has been an area of considerable investment from a technology point of view, because we needed to and wanted to migrate from what was kind of high-touch to low-touch and pick up high volume lower margin business.  And so, portfolio trading algos, the introduction of them, the development of digital platforms where asset managers, insurance companies can come and execute on those platforms using marquee has been a very, very significant and somewhat elevated prospect for us in terms of overall performance. It\u2019s also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and TRS strategies.  It\u2019s all in the context of where a client of the firm can come either through marquee or otherwise and through an API use data and tools that the firm is providing in order to execute. And that is a growing piece of the overall credit business in FICC and an area where we think that there is enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow.  And so, we are seeing monthly users around marquee accelerate. API interaction accelerate. All in the context of kind of the underlying premise to your question.\nMatthew O\u2019Connor : And then, just following up on FICC, I know it\u2019s always annoying when you get asked about like near-term trends. But we\u2019ve seen some unusual activity in rates in the last month with the move down, especially the longer run.  We\u2019ve seen some correction in certain areas of commodities. Has this caused clients to reposition, like change views and driving more activity or most clients view thinking specifically on rates I guess that it\u2019s more temporary and not doing a lot of repositioning with the move we\u2019ve had?\nStephen Scherr : Well, I think, volume intake in ERP has been reasonably volatile, meaning, we\u2019ve seen around certain rate cross currents and the overall debate around inflation, permanent or transitory expressing itself in increased client activity in ERP and then moments of a more muted activity. So ERP has been in both places over the last several months. In the Commodities business, I would say that, we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients. So for example, our business used to be in Commodities, almost 50% oil.  And now, oil is more like 20% and we see greater product dispersion across gas, power, metals and Ags. I think that\u2019s good for our business and it reflects our reaction to - as I say, an expression by clients and customers of greater interest across a wider sort of span of product sets within Commodities itself.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Stephen.\nDavid Solomon : Good morning.\nStephen Scherr : Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy : Stephen, you touched on in your opening prepared remarks about you are positioned well for loan growth accelerating going forward, can you give us some additional color on where you see this loan growth materializing possibly over the next six to twelve months?\nStephen Scherr : Yes. So, let me talk a little bit about where we\u2019ve seen loan growth now, because I think it\u2019s reflective of the forward. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing loan growth in our PWM client channel where we extended about $4 billion of incremental lending in the quarter. It\u2019s a great feeder in the context of our engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool that\u2019s created by virtue of meeting the borrowings.  And this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set that\u2019s borrowing. We\u2019ve seen more lending in the context of our Investment Banking business, much of that relating to transactional activity. Again, it bleeds out to a larger fee pool in the context of where we are.  In Global Markets, we\u2019ve seen ourselves and I mentioned this in Mortgages around Warehouse Financing. So this is very liquid lending that I think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of what\u2019s there. So, the positioning I\u2019m speaking about is, both a broader view about macro risk, about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeves in which we\u2019re lending, and perhaps more importantly, the returns that the firm takes in, in the context of lending into any one of those particular client segments.\nGerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up question, you\u2019ve all seen and we\u2019ve all seen that the reverse repo market has grown dramatically since the first of the year, in fact in less three to four months the Fed in fact raised the rate that they pay on those reverse repos by up to five basis points.  Can you guys share with us your insights, what the implications are of what\u2019s going on in the plumbing, if you will of the financial system here in the states with quantitative easing reverse repos? And how that might be affecting or impacting favorably your trading businesses?\nStephen Scherr : Well, look, any time there is kind of a differentiated view on rates or the markets broadly, as David mentioned, that tends to bleed to a positive outcome for our business more broadly in Global Markets, meaning, to the extent that there is greater volatility, greater activity at wider bid offer spreads, it\u2019s a positive outcome in the overall performance of our business.  Hard for me to give you specific judgments on what\u2019s happening specifically as it relates to the transmission of what\u2019s going on in TRS relating to the revenue in the business itself. But I would say that it portends a positive for our business in the context of overall client activity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research.\nJim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital management from here and how we should think about pace of buybacks, et cetera. You guys have about 100 basis point cushion over your SCB. I guess, 40 basis points on the SLR. Can you maybe just refresh us on what your management buffers you are targeting? How to think about the dynamic going forward between just balance sheet growth, loan growth versus what you are trying to do on the buyback side?\nDavid Solomon : Sure. So, first on SCB and SLR. SCB is more binding to us than SLR. We don\u2019t view SLR as being a binding constraint much as we obviously watch it and maintain an adequate buffer around it. But SCB is more binding than SLR. As it relates to SCB, we have long said that we maintain a 50 to 100 basis point buffer - management buffer above our minimum. I see no reason to sort of change that view.  We do view that buffer not simply as a defensive tool, but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of capital when and if clients look to petition us for it. Actually, during the second quarter that was true. We participated in AT&T and Medline, both of which were momentarily capital consumptive to buffer enabled us to do that and engage.  Just one obviously factual point which is we are at 13.6 under SCB for this the third quarter. We go down to 13.4 in the fourth quarter relative to the most recent CCAR outcome. As it relates to share repurchase, I would only say what I said before, which is, we\u2019ve obviously taken the dividend up reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm and we look to deploy capital at returns and if they continue to demonstrate mid-20% return on equity, you will see us continue to deploy capital in that direction.  To the extent that that falls off for whatever reason, we will take up our share repurchase in that regard. But you should assume us to be an active participant in share repurchase in any given quarter. This is really a question of whether it moves up or down and that\u2019s a function of the kind of return opportunities that we see.\nJim Mitchell : So you \u2013 I mean, just so we have a good understanding. It\u2019s a saying, it\u2019s going to be pretty dynamic quarter-to-quarter in terms of what pace of buyback if you see an opportunity you\u2019ll do it and then vice versa?\nDavid Solomon : That\u2019s precisely right. Yes.\nJim Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane.\nJeremy Sigee : Thank you. Good morning. Just one quick follow-up, please. You talked about regulatory investigations around Archegos. You said it\u2019s too early to know the outcome. But are you seeing other firms pulling back in prime or in equities more broadly as a consequence of the Archegos situation? Is that any part of the market share gains that you\u2019ve been seeing?\nStephen Scherr : Well, hard to tie point A to point B. But you\u2019ve obviously seen open expressions by other firms who are looking to reduce down their prime business. We are going the other way. We want to grow that business.  But as I say, we are growing that business with every element of prudence as to pricing and term structure and alike. But I suspect clients in motion around prime are coming to Goldman Sachs as they are to others and we are looking to sort of grow that business more broadly.\nJeremy Sigee : Okay. Thank you.\nStephen Scherr : Sure.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nDavid Solomon : Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you again in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Carey, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning.  I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a review of our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $15.4 billion, our second highest result on record. The strength, breadth and diversity of our business remained evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $5.5 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $15.02. Second quarter results contributed to our highest ever first half revenues of $33 billion and net earnings of over $12 billion, which drove year-to-date ROE of 27.3% and ROTE of 28.9%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and the constructive but more normalized market environment relative to a year ago. Our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firm's strategic priorities across all four of our businesses as laid out at our 2020 Investor Day. In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leading M&A franchise. Given this position, we observed certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerge from the pandemic, the drive for scale, the push to achieve operating efficiency, the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set.  We've maintained a number one ranking completed M&A for 19 over the last 20 years and have been the leader in equity underwriting for nine of last 10 years. We have broadening our Transaction Banking platform. In June, we launched in the UK and we will now focus on expanding into Japan and other geographies. Although we are early in the rollout, initial client feedback has been quite positive. We delivered solid results in Global Markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance. We continued to deploy balance sheet to support client activity and we are further expanding our means of engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms. A good example is our marquee platform where we are collaborating with MSCI to deliver improved portfolio analytics for our institutional clients versus \u2013 via APIs. In Asset Management, our assets under supervision hit another record of $1.6 trillion as we serve clients by delivering best-in-class investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset classes. We also continue to transition the business to more third-party funds, where we have raised $74 billion in gross commitments across a range of alternative investment strategies since our 2020 Investor Day. Additionally, during the quarter, we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with ICBC, China's largest bank. The JV will combine our expertise in asset management with ICBC's extensive access to retail and institutional clients. The partnership is a testament to our longstanding relationship with ICBC and represents a significant opportunity for us to grow internationally. In Consumer and Wealth Management, we are seeing solid inflows in PWM from new and existing clients and ongoing synergies with our Ayco and PFM businesses. We are also advancing on our vision of creating the leading digital consumer banking platform, where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues to be very high. This quarter, we launched Apple Card Family, which allows co-owners on the same account to build credit together as equals. In addition, as we grow markets invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services, we are building a more comprehensive consumer banking offering.  All in the progress on our strategic priorities, combined with our continued execution, reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and increasing durability of our revenues. Reflecting this confidence, our Board of Directors declared a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2 a share. This follows an increase of over 50% in 2019. Taken together, we have increased the dividend by 150% since I took my seat as CEO. While future increases won't necessarily be of this magnitude, we continue to prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy.  With that, let me now turn to the operating environment on Page 2. It's clear that we are in the middle of the significant economic rebound. This is particularly true in countries like the U.S. and China, driven by the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs. The broader economic improvement has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and in the United States, the prospect of further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending.  A quarter ago, I mentioned my concerns about the prospect of the U.S. economy overheating. But recent commentary from the Federal Reserve indicates that the central bank is focused on this risk, which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be transitory and then any resulting risks could be adequately managed. From here, I remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence. The delta variant, should it spread further, could spear policy actions with slow economic growth. We are already seeing this play out in places like Hong Kong and Australia and potentially in parts of Europe.  While vaccine take-up is progressing, it is not consistent across communities and nations, including parts of the United States. Widespread vaccine distribution and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies. I want to urge policymakers, government officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts. At Goldman Sachs, we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in the United States, Hong Kong and India among other locations, building on the support we are providing communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic.  More broadly as risk managers, we closely monitor developments and retain \u2013 remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the challenges associated with COVID. Right now, the geopolitical landscape, most notably China and cybersecurity are top of mind. As always, we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an ever-changing market backdrop. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. Our Investment Banking backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with corporate client \u2013 with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery. While consumer confidence may prove more volatile, as supplemental benefits expire in the U.S., corporate clients remained steadfast in their efforts to emerge stronger from the pandemic. In our Markets business, ongoing client engagement and increased market share have strengthened our competitive positioning, notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative to a year ago. And across our investing businesses, the current rate environment and search for yield are driving demand for both institutional and individual investors for our world-class scaled investment platform. Before I turn it over to Stephen, I'd like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of Goldman Sachs. We are an incredibly dedicated and resilient team and I am so proud of how we've worked tirelessly to serve our clients and with the challenges over the last 18 months.  Again and again, I've heard from our clients that they say Goldman Sachs stay ahead of the curves and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever. Speaking of that, as many of you know, we formally welcomed our colleagues in New York, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Hong Kong and other locations to office this summer.  With roughly 50% of our people in these offices back on a regular basis, I can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating. We recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic and we'll continue to provide our colleagues with the support they need.  Going forward, we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which we operate. I've heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the office and clients appreciate that we are showing up. We've always given our people the flexibility they need to manage their professional and personal lives and we will continue to do so.  That said, I believe bringing us back together, forging the close bond to support a culture of collaboration has renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive. I am particularly excited to see nearly 5,800 interns and new hires who are joining us this summer, many in person working side-by-side with long-tenured professionals of Goldman Sachs. I'll close by saying I am very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. I am especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop.  Importantly, we are making progress in executing our strategy, and I believe we are on a path to sustainable mid-teens returns.  With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen. Thanks a lot, Glenn. So on prime balances, they have grown. They've grown kind of consistent with the broader strategy that we set up. As to distinguish that growth between the environment and clients, I would say it's both. I would say the environment obviously by virtue of balance is accreting in this market, that has grown balances and we've obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients and, frankly speaking, to be more profound with our existing ones. But I would tell you that in the context of all of that, and I mentioned this in the script, there is a clear screen, which looks at where we are pricing, how we are structuring terms, both around new entrants and equally around the back book of our prime balances. And so, we are being rather judicious in the context of what we bring to assure that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view, but it is both environment and clients and our ambition is to take that share up, but to do it in a rather prudent way. On the part of your question relating to Archegos, look, this has obviously gathered kind of an investigative purview from a number of geographies and across regulators. Kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or what that yields.  I suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure, both of which we would be supportive of, there will be moves by regulators to achieve that. But very hard to say, kind of, as to where that all plays out. As we shared in our first quarter earnings call, we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of regulatory and industry change that will come about. Sure. Sure. So, progress on both fronts has been considerable. I would say, let's start with Apple Card. The press around creating the family plan was frankly speaking to achieve a greater and more positive user experience. So that people across a family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting, broadly speaking. I think that move will accelerate share. But I think more importantly, and its objective was to create just a better overall user experience. On Apple Card, generally, I would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of COVID, we've seen the credit profile of Apple Card customers to prove positive, perhaps even more positive than we thought.  And we've now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth consistent with the tone of the consumer market that we are seeing. And I think there is more opportunities to be had with Apple using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set. So, you'll start to see forward growth, and I suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increase in originations and underwriting in Apple Card and the family plan will only serve to help that.  In transaction banking, that business continues to grow. We are upwards of now several hundred clients, $40 billion of deposits. And perhaps most importantly, when you look at that deposit base, we are starting to see an acceleration of operational deposits approaching 15%. And that's obviously the linchpin to creating a deposit base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm. I will tell you based on our opening expectations of that business, we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers. It's turning out that the user interface and the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what we are offering by way of experience and technology is proving to be the winning ticket.  And so, as both David and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are going to start to see geographic expansion both to the UK and Japan. We've set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities. And so, I think that business will continue to play forward.  And perhaps what's most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the One GS mantra and the way in which we are able to sell in through an existing client base. So, thanks, Christian. We appreciate the question. And on the first part of the question, we absolutely have made progress on our goal with respect to capital efficiency and the on-balance sheet investing. And I'll let Stephen highlight some of the details in the moment \u2013 at the moment. But we continue to move aggressively to manage those positions. I think it's a very constructive environment for us to do so and I think we'll continue to do that. You'll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions.  We continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more durable and recurring revenues and the fee-based emphasis of the fundraising that we are doing in the asset management business is one aspect of that.  On the broader question about opportunity, I think one of the reasons why we decrease our buyback in the quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business. And so, if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner, we will continue to do it, but we want to remain and I think we've always been a very, very nimble capital allocator. And so, when we see those opportunities, we will make investments and we'll continue to grow the business. If for some reason the environment changes and we don't, we will return that capital appropriately to shareholders. Stephen, do you want to comment just on the progress along those sell-downs, because we have made real targeted progress and we'll continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals we've set out. Good morning, Steve. Sure. So, a couple of thoughts on that broadly. I mean, the environment for investment banking activity, Steven, continues to be very, very constructive. And I think that there is a good chance that that will continue to play forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues.  In my remarks, I highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic there were a handful of factors that we think are structurally driving CEOs and Boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an increasingly evolving digital world.  And we are seeing really, really broad engagement across our franchise with respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go-forward basis. And the world that's actually evolving quite quickly, I am encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high record levels and a lot of that I think feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment.  Obviously, if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn't seem likely given where we are positioned today. With respect to global markets, we picked up a 160 basis points of market share through quarter one and that's allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us.  I don't have specific market share KPIs on investment banking to share right on this call, we can certainly follow-up more broadly on some things. Obviously, we tracked our \u2013 we track our lead table position both in M&A and equity and debt and there, we've been strengthening our position over time and it's consistently at the top of those lead tables. What I do say is affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our Investor Day process to serve a broader array of clients was to really expand that footprint and the footprint of available clients let's say are in the $500 million to $3 billion enterprise value has been significant.  It's grown and we've continued to expand that footprint and we're quite effective at penetrating that. And so that's been a very good opportunity for us and I actually think that opportunity will continue. I think our Investment Banking business is positioned incredibly well. I think we continue as we have been to be a leader in that business over the course of the last decades and the quality of the talent we have in that business continues to be strong, differentiated and very, very front-footed with our clients. And so, there certainly could be macro events over 12, 24, 36 months period that slowed down the current momentum, but at the moment, it feels quite constructive. At a high level and I appreciate the question, Steven, I don't think our views on transformational M&A have evolved. Call-after-call, quarter-after-quarter I've said and I'll say again that the bar would always be extremely high for us to do something very, very significant.  But I've also said that our drive to diversify our revenues and create more durable revenues comes, as both Stephen and I have highlighted in our remarks, from continuing to invest in and grow our Asset Management business, continuing to invest in and grow the opportunity in our Wealth Management business and for broadening our digital Consumer Banking platform. There may be opportunities from time-to-time that can accelerate the direction of travel in those. We look at things constantly. If we see things that could accelerate the direction of travel in those businesses and accelerate our goals in those businesses, we'll certainly consider them always \u2013 always with a high bar.  It wouldn't surprise you that prices at the moment are high and that certainly has an impact on how we think about these things. But we are making a lot of progress organically and we continue to be focused on that organic growth. Well, the strategy \u2013 the strategy has been to take a broad Asset Management business and particularly around alternatives that has been extremely balance sheet heavy and turn it into more of a fund-based model and we've only started to really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly.  And as Stephen highlighted, since our Investor Day, we've raised $75 billion in fund structure. I think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds, we invest as GP alongside our institutional investors and so there will always be equity investments through our fund participation, but the cycle that we are going through is one of shifting from significant on-balance sheet investments over time to a much broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller and therefore the overall equity position will be meaningfully smaller than it's been. Now it's a good problem if the market keeps going up and therefore the value seems to be staying the same even though we are making very, very significant sales. But over time, as we continue to grow the funds portion of the business and we continue on the path of disposing, that number will get smaller. We haven't put out a target number, but by definition, it will get smaller. In the near-term, our balance sheet will come down and our AE target is a little less than $18 billion. Sure. And I am going to answer the second \u2013 I am going to answer the second part first. And then I'll circle back on the Executive Order and kind of the broader \u2013 the broader roadmap around M&A. But I don't think the sponsor activity is driven by tax. The sponsor business at this point is a broad, diverse business. There is enormous dry powder.  There is an enormous amount of money that moves in that ecosystem. There is real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to increase the waiting to alternatives. It's one of the reasons why the strategy we are focused as one of the leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that, because there is lots of demand for our clients.  And so, I don't think that there is any overlay from a tax perspective that's accelerating activity there. I do think that activity has accelerated, because the market environment is quite constructive and it's been quite a constructive environment for asset prices generally. With respect to the broad M&A environment and anti-trust and the Executive Order, I mean, obviously, the Executive Order I think serves the roadmap for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current administration would like to get done over the next four years that relate broadly to competition, consumer protection issues.  This is \u2013 it's a broad and ambitious range of ideas. It's something that I think we'll have to watch very, very closely. Ultimately, the order can't direct the agencies that make the anti-trust decisions to make those decisions. But it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact.  But the agencies will have to over time, put forward or through the actions they take create more transparency on that. We'll be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies. Certainly, I think there is a tipping in the balance that could in the margin have some impact on certain transactions.  I'd certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation. There will certainly be a lot of discussion in that area. But I think it's early and I think you have to watch it closely and I think the macro environment and the tailwinds from the macro environment, some of the things I said earlier about companies' desire is to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay, but we are going to have to watch that very carefully. Sure, sure, sure Brennan. I appreciate the question. And as we've highlighted earlier in the call, we are quite proud of our leading Investment Banking franchise. It's been a leading franchise for decades and I think one of the primary reasons it's been a leading franchise is because of the quality of the people that we are able to attract and retain at Goldman Sachs, we serve our clients and serve our clients extraordinarily well.  We have always paid very competitively. We have always been a pay-for-performance organization. We are performing. We have a normal pay cycle. For analysts that normal pay cycle happens to be in August and we'll continue to pay competitively and pay-per-performance, but that's part of our strategy that's been in place for a long time and will obviously continue. With respect to salaries, we revaluate salaries in regular course every single year and when appropriate, we make sure our salaries are competitive. So, we continue to thrive by having the best people here and paying them appropriately especially when we perform, we are performing. And I would tell you to expect to see us pay appropriately during our normal cycle. Hey, Mike. I'll start and Stephen will add, Mike. But at a high level - and we've talked about this. We've talked about efficiency in the firm. We've talked about digitization. We've talked about connectivity to our clients and ways the technology can leverage our ability to serve our clients, all that continues.  And there is a significant investment going into that making the firm more efficient, but most importantly, levering our people's capabilities to better serve our clients. I think that we are in the third inning of that evolution. There is more opportunity. But there have been some real gains.  And Stephen can probably quantify on some basis how we think about that. But I think there is a lot more opportunity for us to continue through digitization and the way we connect with our clients and the tools we use to create more leverage broadly. And so, we continue to be focused on that. Stephen? Yes, the only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is that, when we started building this business four, five years ago, it's certainly within our vision of the world that customers would have a lot more flexibility to move their data and attach to different platforms. And so, certainly in our macro design of where we think the world is going, the direction of travel that way is not something surprising to us. Hey, Devin. Sure. Good morning. Well, I think broadly speaking, we are performing very well across a very, very diverse platform of businesses. Certainly, I can't predict the future. This certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow vis-a-vis the levels of activity we are seeing today.  On the other hand, at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity, there are also parts of our business that performed quite well and have some counter-cyclicality. So, I think we have a big at scale business. We are at scale and a number of our businesses and a leader. I think those businesses will continue through the cycle to produce very, very good returns.  I think we are building other businesses that as Stephen highlighted are going to be scaling. Some of them are different kinds of businesses, but they offer opportunity for more consistent modelable, more consistent returns that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable. I believe that our business activities are durable through the cycle and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it. And so, I believe if we continue to do that over time, the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way others and our peers are valued should narrow. But we are going to continue to focus on serving our clients, growing these businesses, expanding the platforms and my belief is the market will follow. And I just add broadly, the kind of environment that obviously affects our returns, certainly when you look historically, it's affected other of our peer institutions' returns too. There are differences in our business. But I don't think they are as different as they are amplified from time-to-time. We absolutely think that we can build an at-scale business over the course of the next three to five years without doing something on organic. If we saw something that we thought could accelerate that or enhance that, we'd certainly consider it. But we have a detailed plan that gives us what we think is a scalable, which is an at-scale significant business over the next five years.  And we are going to continue to invest and continue to execute against it. And as we've said a number of times, those investments and that drive to do that is not affecting our either mid or slightly longer-term return targets and thresholds that we continue to drive towards. Good morning. Good morning. Sure. So, first on SCB and SLR. SCB is more binding to us than SLR. We don't view SLR as being a binding constraint much as we obviously watch it and maintain an adequate buffer around it. But SCB is more binding than SLR. As it relates to SCB, we have long said that we maintain a 50 to 100 basis point buffer - management buffer above our minimum. I see no reason to sort of change that view.  We do view that buffer not simply as a defensive tool, but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of capital when and if clients look to petition us for it. Actually, during the second quarter that was true. We participated in AT&T and Medline, both of which were momentarily capital consumptive to buffer enabled us to do that and engage.  Just one obviously factual point which is we are at 13.6 under SCB for this the third quarter. We go down to 13.4 in the fourth quarter relative to the most recent CCAR outcome. As it relates to share repurchase, I would only say what I said before, which is, we've obviously taken the dividend up reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm and we look to deploy capital at returns and if they continue to demonstrate mid-20% return on equity, you will see us continue to deploy capital in that direction.  To the extent that that falls off for whatever reason, we will take up our share repurchase in that regard. But you should assume us to be an active participant in share repurchase in any given quarter. This is really a question of whether it moves up or down and that's a function of the kind of return opportunities that we see. That's precisely right. Yes. Okay. Since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you again in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Carey and the Investor Relations team. Otherwise please stay safe and we look forward to speaking with you on our third quarter call in October."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning. I will start with our business performance by segment beginning on Page 4.  Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion. Financial Advisory revenues of $1.3 billion reflected an elevated number of deal closings in the quarter and increasing market position of our business as we have expanded our client footprint.  We maintained our number one league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $975 billion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 33%. Activity continues to be strong across geographies, particularly in the Americas with strength across all industry groups reflecting the breadth of our franchise.  Underwriting performance remained very strong with its second highest quarterly revenues following on from a record performance in the first quarter. Equity underwriting performance in particular, continued to be strong, generating $1.2 billion in revenues amid elevated IPO activity and representing our third consecutive quarter with revenues of over $1 billion.  We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in the first half climbing to $85 billion across 400 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%, up 40 basis points versus full year 2020. Notably, we led over 160 IPOs for the year-to-date, more than all of last year. In Debt Underwriting net revenues were $950 million with performance supported by strong high-yield volumes and importantly, robust acquisition financing activity including LBOs, as well as strong M&A and financial sponsor activity. This performance reflects the integrated nature of our Financing and Advisory businesses, as well as our dominant share in financial sponsor activity.  Additionally, ESG remained a focus of the market, particularly in Europe with strong issuance volumes across sustainability-linked bonds and loans. We expect this trend to continue in future quarters. Notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year, as David noted, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity, as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Corporate Lending results of $159 million reflect revenues from Transaction Banking and Middle Market and Relationship Lending, net of approximately $130 million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the relationship loan book.  Transaction Banking is performing well. The business is approaching 300 clients, generating roughly $40 billion in deposits with an increasing percentage becoming operational. Moving to Global Markets on Page 5, segment net revenues were $4.9 billion in the quarter, driven by solid client activity and a generally supportive market making environment. Our franchise continued to exhibit strength across both FICC and equities, notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced significant dislocation and volatility driving elevated client volumes.  We remain focused on building upon recent market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment. Beginning with FICC on Page 6, second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion. In rates, performance was impacted by spread compression, amid lower volatility, though activity remained high with a number of macroeconomic cross currents, around economic recovery and inflation.  In Commodities, we saw solid performance across our increasingly diversified business with contributions from oil, natural gas and power, Ags and metals and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows. In Mortgages, strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business, offset by lower results in agency mortgages. The business continues to diversify its revenue across market making, loan origination and financing.  Across both credit and currencies, lower volatility, more muted volumes and spread compression led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters though market share gains helped offset the effects of a relatively subdued trading environment.  FICC financing revenues of $423 million were driven by mortgage lending, offset by lower repo performance. Moving to equities, net revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion as we actively deployed our balance sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $1.8 billion with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives.  In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low touch channels and in derivatives, we saw solid performance in EMEA following a more orderly market in European dividends relative to a year ago and stronger results in structured products across geographies. Equities Financing revenues of $815 million were strong given record average balances in our prime business. Growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and new clients. While growth in equities financing remains a strategic priority, we nonetheless maintain a very disciplined focus on risk management, pricing and structural terms of engagement. Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the second quarter, we generated record revenues of $5.1 billion. Management and other fees totaled $727 million, which rose year-on-year, despite approximately $160 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. These waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with industry practice in this rate environment. Incentive fees for the quarter was $78 million. Equity investments produced record net gains of $3.7 billion, amid a supportive market backdrop, particularly in growth equity, which drove roughly one-third of these revenues. The growth equity business has a 15-year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is focused exclusively on investments in growth-stage, technology-driven companies spanning multiple industries. Let me break down the results more specifically. On our $4 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $900 million, driven by market appreciation on investments including Privia Health, KnowBe4 and Flywire. We will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit.  Across our $17 billion private equity book, we've generated gains of $2.8 billion from various positions, more than two-thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in Oncoclinicas, a Brazilian oncology business; Sterling, a provider of screening solutions; and Zipwhip, a messaging software firm. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our portfolio consolidated investment entities.  Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $610 million, driven by NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. These gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. On Page 8, we show the composition of our diversified asset management balance sheet consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Staying with Asset Management, let me turn to Page 9. We included this page in today's earnings presentation to provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments in Asset Management over the first half of the year. This is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business.  The message on the page is simple, while the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased modestly since the end of last year, we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and IPOs of roughly $5.5 billion.  These dispositions have been largely offset by mark-ups on the portfolio of approximately $5 billion, given the supportive market backdrop mentioned, as well as modest additions to the balance sheet, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. So while the balance sheet is slightly higher, we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions year-to-date is approximately $4 billion. And at this stage, we have line of sight on roughly $3 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to over $1 billion of capital reduction.  As noted earlier, we will continue to pursue this disposition activity, particularly given treatment of on-balance sheet equity investments under CCAR. Moving to Page 10, Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Wealth Management revenues of $1.4 billion included record management and other fees of $1.1 billion as assets under supervision increased to $672 billion.  Private Banking and Lending revenues were $260 million with loans to private wealth clients up $4 billion sequentially, consistent with our growth objectives. We remained focused on synergies between our PFM and PWM franchises where we continue to see referrals, representing a significant AUS opportunity.  Consumer Banking revenues were $363 million in the quarter reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card loans. The low-rate environment, as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past 15 months continues to impact the business, though forward growth should help to offset this. Next, let's turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees.  Total AUS increased to a record $2.3 trillion during the quarter. The sequential increase of $101 billion was driven by $22 billion of long-term inflows, $16 billion of liquidity inflows and $63 billion of market appreciation. Our firm-wide management and other fees grew by 13% versus the second quarter of 2020 to a record $1.8 billion. On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the second quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest earning assets. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $131 billion, up $10 billion sequentially, driven by Wealth Management and Residential Real Estate Warehouse Lending, as well as Apple Card.  Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $92 million, which includes a reserve reduction, driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop, partially offset by portfolio growth. As the credit environment remains benign, we expect loan growth to accelerate in coming quarters consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm. Let's turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $8.6 billion and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense discipline while investing for growth.  Our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at 34%, though compensation expense increased year-over-year, reflecting strong results, in line with our pay-for-performance culture. Non-compensation expenses were down 43% versus last year due to significantly lower litigation cost. Excluding the impact of litigation, non-compensation was up approximately 6% relative to top-line growth of 16% as increases in transaction base and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to investment entities.  We remained focused on the $1.3 billion expense efficiency target announced at Investor Day. As we noted at a recent industry conference, we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the medium term, which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm.  Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.8%. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% and we'll monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. Turning to our balance sheet and capital on Slide 14. On June 28th, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.4%, which implies a Common Equity Tier 1 requirement of 13.4% effective October 1.  As David mentioned, we also announced an increase in our dividend to $2 per share. While our expectation of the Federal Reserve stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our SCB, the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of our businesses.  In light of our most recent SCB, we recognized that our standardized CET1 ratio will remain elevated for this CCAR cycle and achieving our target in the medium term, by definition will be more challenging. That said, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We have prioritized deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of earnings and then returning any excess to shareholders via share repurchases.  In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and approximately $440 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm, we lowered our stock repurchases in the quarter. Our book value per share rose to a record $264.90, up 6% sequentially. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, 7% higher versus last quarter. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $329 billion. On the liabilities side, our total deposits rose to $306 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter and our long-term debt also rose by $20 billion, driven by $18 billion of benchmark issuance. Let me just spend a moment on funding. As we noted on our Fixed Income Call in May, our year-to-date benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year contrary to our intention at the start of the year, but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm.  We expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring non-bank funding persist, albeit at a more moderate pace than the $38 billion issued in the first half. Nonetheless, we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher utilization of deposit funding globally.  To that end, we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank entities to facilitate more activity in the U.S. bank bringing our banks to nearly 30% of the firm-wide balance sheet. In conclusion, we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm. Given strategic progress and recent performance, we are confident around our medium-term return targets with a path to sustainable mid-teens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Yes. So, I guess, let's just start kind of with the facts. Obviously, on the new page that we showed you, $5.5 billion did come off-balance sheet producing $4 billion of capital relief. And as I mentioned, there is another $3 billion that's in sight to take $1 billion of capital down. Now, that just looks narrowly speaking at the private equity portfolio. There is consolidated investment entities. There are debt positions, all of which are on-balance sheet, all of which are subject to further reduction, all of which will reduce down capital. Now why does that matter and why we want to stick to that strategy, Christian, as opposed to kind of abandon it? Well, first of all, obviously, we are looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm. The one way to do that is to influence the denominator. The way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more broadly. At the same time, this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm, which is that moving from on-balance sheet to fund format and the fact that we've raised since Investor Day, $75 billion of new funds in those funds, okay? We'll increase assets under supervision and equally we'll increase fee revenue that's being generated by those investments in that fund format.  And so, in a way the page to watch on the forward will be Page 11 of our Investor Day presentation, because what's going to play out and we promise more disclosure which we will deliver, but firm-wide assets under supervision will go up. Firm-wide management and other fees will go up. Those will prove to be more durable and predictable and I think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of businesses.  And I think that's the broader picture if you will in terms of what we are trying to achieve. What we put on Page 9 was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made much as it would otherwise be masked by as you put it kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of on-balance sheet investments. Good morning. The only other thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that if you look at Page 8 in the presentation, on the left-hand side, you can see we've been talking a lot about the $21 billion of equity investments. But equally consolidated investment entities of $18 billion is fertile ground to continue to bring this down and reduce down the AE in the segment.  And so, all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go. Obviously, the objective or the near-term target as it were of AE of getting down to $18 billion or lower remains that and we are committed to get to it notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio, because as you rightly point out, that also presents opportunity to accelerate where we can the sell-down of these positions. Well, look, I think, the way to think about this is that, we are not waiting for the Fed to deliver us a result that's satisfactory, okay, much as we are petitioning them on some issues that are relevant. We are taking a lot of self-help here.  We've been talking about one, the overall push to durable revenues, right, is going to factor into the way in which the Fed determines PPNR in the context of the overall SCB calculation. So it's not just limited to this. It means, what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated, as David spoke about and I did of $75 billion and growing in fund format.  What does it mean in the context of a growing consumer business? What does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction banking? All of these will prove to be more durable, viewed that way presumably by the Fed to yield a better PPNR sort of calculation in the overall test. So we are not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of considerable consequence in the way in which CCAR treats on balance sheet investing.  And then, again, we remain quite engaged with the Fed, as we put our letter in last year and we will only serve to reinforce those issues this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower SCB calculation. Hey, Mike. Yes. Mike, the way we look at it and compute it is, we look at the introduction of technology into a variety of different work streams. Take risk for example, where there is mandatory production of tens of thousands of reports, either by regulators or consumption internally and we go through a zero-based budgeting exercise where we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays forward. When I think about the forward for the firm, the real cost gains are going to happen and the production of higher marginal margins are going to play out by virtue of the achievement of scale. When we achieve scale in certain of these businesses, take Transaction Banking, take the Consumer business, even look at what we do in platforms like PFM, okay, we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because we've got an embedded base that is built to scale.  And those businesses will scale over time, over the medium to long-term and the effect of unit cost, if you will of producing what we do will come down. And so that's just a sense both in the spot, zero-based budgeting, risk, et cetera, but equally on the forward in terms of how to think about the achievement of scale and higher marginal margin in the business. Well, I would say couple of things. I mean, one is to repeat what David said, which is, it's a bit early. Right, now what we came to the issuance of the Executive Order is to exactly how that plays, okay? From our perspective, we started this consumer business on a white sheet of paper. So we are not retrofitting a series of transactions or incumbent businesses.  And so, as we look to continue to build the consumer platform, we are quite open to the notion that there will be shared set of data. The data will be portable. Our focus has been entirely from the customer back, which is what does the customer want? What is the customer need in the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform? And so, these products are all about the design, utilization of data.  We obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren, which is, we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount. We are no different than any other bank. We take that responsibility seriously. But I think on the new build, on a white sheet of paper, we are less burdened by these issues, less protective of an incumbent business and more focused on where we can take it and where we can build. Yes, sure. Okay. So let me take the three pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that and you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confidence to about $400 million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the 2022 timeline that we set for the achievement of the $1.3 billion.  So confident in the existing number and giving an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there. Again, all of this consistent actually with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people. And so, that's where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives. In terms of comp and non-comp and the forward, let me say this. On compensation, as David has indicated, we have always been in a pay-for-performance mode. We'll continue to be that. As the firm performs, we will continue to sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent.  I will say, as we said in the past on compensation, that the compensation as sort of a call out component to operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these scale businesses. And so, therefore, you'll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we have historically been rather pre-occupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself.  That's lesser reflection of any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent. It is more to do with the composition of businesses that we are building and the kind of non-comp intensity of expenses related to it. On non-comp expense, I would say, we have in virtually every one of the recent quarter has been quite focused on ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business. That is, our non-comp expense normalized for kind of excessive one-off litigation or the like, trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top-line of the firm.  So this quarter, as I noted, while the as reported non-comp expense is down about 43%, that's influenced very heavily by the $2.9 billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year. When you look at it like-for-like, our non-comp expense is up 6% against the 16% top-line revenue growth. I think that should be a guidepost for how we are going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward. On the third question you asked about funding optimization, here I would say, we are \u2013 we remain committed and confident in the achievement of the $1 billion in funding optimization. Bear in mind that as I spoke about increased non-deposit funding or increased wholesale funding, the overall funding mix or the funding taken in total for the firm is going up.  It's going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm and as much as we grow non-bank or wholesale funding, we are equally growing the deposit base. We are doing that now at a lower price point than where we were before. It's indicative of NII growing in the firm. And so, we are confident that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and take us to $1 billion of runrate savings within the timeframe. Good morning. Sure, Devin. So, I would say, the process of sell-through here is better in terms of rate of growth than we anticipated, but the way in which it's happening is as we anticipated, which is that, we are not new to any one of the corporates who are coming on to this platform. There is a longstanding corporate relationship that has opened the door.  We had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable business, we recognize that there was a progression where you have large corporates that have a platform of three or four participating banks that our breaking point was to be number three or four and this wasn't conditioned on us jumping to the number one spot on that platform out of the box. Now, my view is that, as treasurers and CFOs grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on the platform, we will grow. We will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the Transaction Banking platform and we will see our ranking, if you will, on that platform grow.  If we began at three or four, we'll see ourselves to two and perhaps one. And that will continue to sort of grow and expand. But these are formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm so that sell-through is, as we expected, perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth and that's kind of the progression. I would also say that that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the $40 billion growing that we will see, because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business, percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational. Therefore more valuable.  And so, that I think is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it were for any given corporate client. Good morning. I mean, to some extent, if you reflect on David's comments, ROE is nothing, but numerator over denominator. And so, we're controlling both revenue in-take and expense in the context of the numerator and equally working hard to do what we can of our own volition to reduce down the denominator in the context of SCB.  But, the reality is, we sit where we sit. We are changing kind of the dynamic of the business profile all to yield a higher ROE, which will translate, as David suggested into the potential for a much better look at the valuation of the firm overall. Good morning. So, in the context of our credit business in FICC, this has been an area of considerable investment from a technology point of view, because we needed to and wanted to migrate from what was kind of high-touch to low-touch and pick up high volume lower margin business.  And so, portfolio trading algos, the introduction of them, the development of digital platforms where asset managers, insurance companies can come and execute on those platforms using marquee has been a very, very significant and somewhat elevated prospect for us in terms of overall performance. It's also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and TRS strategies.  It's all in the context of where a client of the firm can come either through marquee or otherwise and through an API use data and tools that the firm is providing in order to execute. And that is a growing piece of the overall credit business in FICC and an area where we think that there is enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow.  And so, we are seeing monthly users around marquee accelerate. API interaction accelerate. All in the context of kind of the underlying premise to your question. Well, I think, volume intake in ERP has been reasonably volatile, meaning, we've seen around certain rate cross currents and the overall debate around inflation, permanent or transitory expressing itself in increased client activity in ERP and then moments of a more muted activity. So ERP has been in both places over the last several months. In the Commodities business, I would say that, we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients. So for example, our business used to be in Commodities, almost 50% oil.  And now, oil is more like 20% and we see greater product dispersion across gas, power, metals and Ags. I think that's good for our business and it reflects our reaction to - as I say, an expression by clients and customers of greater interest across a wider sort of span of product sets within Commodities itself. Good morning. Yes. So, let me talk a little bit about where we've seen loan growth now, because I think it's reflective of the forward. So, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are seeing loan growth in our PWM client channel where we extended about $4 billion of incremental lending in the quarter. It's a great feeder in the context of our engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool that's created by virtue of meeting the borrowings.  And this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set that's borrowing. We've seen more lending in the context of our Investment Banking business, much of that relating to transactional activity. Again, it bleeds out to a larger fee pool in the context of where we are.  In Global Markets, we've seen ourselves and I mentioned this in Mortgages around Warehouse Financing. So this is very liquid lending that I think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of what's there. So, the positioning I'm speaking about is, both a broader view about macro risk, about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeves in which we're lending, and perhaps more importantly, the returns that the firm takes in, in the context of lending into any one of those particular client segments. Well, look, any time there is kind of a differentiated view on rates or the markets broadly, as David mentioned, that tends to bleed to a positive outcome for our business more broadly in Global Markets, meaning, to the extent that there is greater volatility, greater activity at wider bid offer spreads, it's a positive outcome in the overall performance of our business.  Hard for me to give you specific judgments on what's happening specifically as it relates to the transmission of what's going on in TRS relating to the revenue in the business itself. But I would say that it portends a positive for our business in the context of overall client activity. Well, hard to tie point A to point B. But you've obviously seen open expressions by other firms who are looking to reduce down their prime business. We are going the other way. We want to grow that business.  But as I say, we are growing that business with every element of prudence as to pricing and term structure and alike. But I suspect clients in motion around prime are coming to Goldman Sachs as they are to others and we are looking to sort of grow that business more broadly. Sure."

I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Calls. This call is being recorded today, April 14, 2021. Thank you. Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference.\nHeather Kennedy Miner: Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. No information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. Today, I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr; and Carey Halio, our incoming Head of Investor Relations, who will host this call beginning in July. Carey most recently served as the firm\u2019s Deputy Treasurer and CEO of GS Bank USA and began her career in credit risk as a bank analyst. She brings 22 years experience at Goldman Sachs to her new role. As I leave this seat to assume the role of COO of our asset management business, I want to extend my sincere appreciation to each of you for your partnership over the years. On the call today, David will start with a high level review of our first quarter performance and our client franchise. He will also provide an update on the operating environment and macroeconomic backdrop. Stephen will then discuss our first quarter results in detail. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks. I\u2019ll now pass the call to David. David?\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Heather, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before I begin my remarks, let me thank Heather for leading the firm\u2019s Investor Relations effort for the past four years and welcome Carey to the role. I will begin on page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results. In the first quarter, we produced record net revenues of $17.7 billion. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident as we delivered net earnings of $6.8 billion, record quarterly earnings per share of $18.60, and a return on equity of 31% and a return on tangible equity of 32.9% the highest in over a decade. Our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength of our franchise in the supportive environment which we operated during the quarter. These results also evidenced our successful execution towards the firm\u2019s strategic priorities. We maintained our leading global positions across M&A and equity underwriting. We delivered the best performance in global markets in a decade with strength in FICC and equities driven by solid client activity across our platform and reinforced by last year\u2019s market share gains. In asset management, we recognized significant net gains across our public and private equity positions, and we continued to harvest on-balance sheet investments in our efforts to transition the business to more third-party assets, where we are making progress in raising funds across a range of investing strategies. In Wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra-high net worth PWM clients, while we further scale our personal financial management business. And in Consumer, we continue to make strong progress on our vision to create the leading digital consumer banking platform. This quarter, we launched Marcus Invest in the U.S., our digital investment offering, which provides consumers access to diversified investment portfolios with as little as a $1,000 investment. The customer response and uptake since launch has been positive and we are focused on scaling the platform. We\u2019re also working towards the launch of digital checking in the U.S. and Marcus Invest in the UK. Importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet as we continue to deploy our resources to support clients amid an evolving and dynamic market backdrop. With that, let me turn now to the operating environment on page 2. As anticipated, we saw improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop during the first quarter, which was supported by the continued accommodative fiscal and monetary policies of central banks and governments around the world. At this stage, it is clear to me that the U.S. is poised for a strong recovery this year, led by consumer spending that is rebounding to pre-COVID levels. This sentiment is reflected in the capital markets with U.S. equities hovering at or near records and bolstered by recent U.S. employment data and our economists\u2019 forecast on GDP growth. Despite these positive developments, we recognized that the operating backdrop will undoubtedly evolve and that much of the global economic recovery will depend on the progress around COVID-19. While the rollout of vaccines is well underway in the U.S. and the UK, distribution has been challenged in a number of other countries around the globe, and the prospect of new variants add to potential concerns around the trajectory of the economic recovery. As you would expect, we remain vigilant to risks across markets. We are mindful of elevated valuation levels across certain asset classes, increased volatility in certain single name stocks, and are aware of the inflationary risks inherent in the actions being taken to stimulate continued growth in the economy. Let me now also take a moment to share my views on a few important topics while I\u2019ve been fielding questions from clients and other stakeholders. First, on the events related to Archegos Capital, this was a case of an investor with highly concentrated and leveraged positions. This is not the first time we\u2019ve seen a situation like this, and it likely won\u2019t be the last. We have robust risk management that governs the amount of financing we provide for these types of portfolios. Our risk controls, all of which were put in place long before the March events, worked well. We identified the risk early and took prompt action consistent with the terms of our contract with the client. I am pleased with how the firm handled it, and And it\u2019s a reflection of the engagement and communication of teams across Goldman Sachs, both in the business and on the control side of our firm. These events raised reasonable questions around market practice and transparency. They are worthy of debate, and we intend to play a constructive role in that dialog. Next on SPACs, we continue to believe that providing sponsors a mechanism to access public markets for capital formation is an innovation that\u2019s here to stay. However, as a meaningful participant in this market, we will continue to be thoughtful regarding the transactions we underwrite, with a particular focus on the quality of sponsors, sponsor economics, investor protections, and disclosure. We believe the industry should evolve on these important issues in the interest of more efficient and transparent markets. I also want to touch on the topics of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the digitization of money. As activities in these areas progress, there will be a significant disruption and change in the way money moves around the world. Many central banks are looking at digital currencies and working to apply this technology to their local markets and determine the longer term impact on global payment systems. There\u2019s also significant focus on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where the trajectory is less clear as market participants evaluate their possibility as a store of value. At Goldman Sachs, we continue to look for ways to expand our capabilities to support our client needs and evaluate applications to improve our organizational efficiency. Of course, we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines. For example, we cannot own Bitcoin or trade it as principal. Goldman Sachs will play a role in these innovations as they are important to our clients and important to the future of global financial systems. Another topic coming up in stakeholder conversations is sustainability. We remain steadfast in our commitments to sustainable finance. Central to our purpose as an organization, our programs are commercially attractive and utilize our expertise and capital to support all of our stakeholders. During the quarter, we issued our first sustainability bond, where we raised $800 million, the proceeds of which will be allocated towards initiatives aimed at accelerating climate transition and advancing inclusive growth. We also launched One Million Black Women, an initiative that I\u2019m very proud of and through which the firm will commit $10 billion of direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital for capacity building grants over the next decade to narrow the opportunity gaps for black women in the United States. Separately, we also committed an additional $500 million to \u2018Launch With GS\u2019, our program designed to invest in diversified companies and fund managers, bringing our total commitments to $1 billion. Finally, I want to take a few minutes to comment on our people. I continue to hear from clients that the quality and dedication of our people is one of our great differentiators. The firm\u2019s quarterly results are product of our client focus and the dedication of the employees of Goldman Sachs, day in and day out. Notwithstanding the challenges that they have all faced as we mark one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, our people have rallied to the needs of our clients. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world. I am in awe of their performance and of our results this quarter due to their hard work, dedication and our culture of teamwork. It will always be a priority for our firm to attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients and execute on our strategy. We have a vibrant partnership and a deep bench of talent across the organization. Many will spend their entire career with us. Some will even become clients of the firm. This is a virtuous ecosystem that has been in place for decades. It is also aligned with the evolution of our partnership strategy where we\u2019re working to continue to make the partnership more aspirational. I recognize there\u2019s an enormous amount of discussion about how companies will operate their businesses post pandemic. For Goldman Sachs, our people operate at their best when they are forging close bonds with colleagues and furthering the apprenticeship culture that has defined us. We have found the best way to do that is to work together in person on a regular basis. Let me be clear, achieving the objective of bringing our colleagues back to the office is not inconsistent with the desire to provide our people with the flexibility they need to manage the personal and professional lives, which is the way we have always run this firm. And given the experience of the past year, I\u2019m more confident than ever in our ability to facilitate this approach going forward. Over the course of the past few months, we\u2019ve been welcoming thousands of colleagues back to the office in a manner consistent with safety guidelines in each city in which we operate. We have implemented testing and other protocols across our offices to make for a safer work environment and to provide those returning to the office with a sense of confidence in the return. Importantly, I look forward to increasing number of employees returning as vaccination programs around the world expand, and we welcome new joiners to the firm\u2019s offices this summer. Regarding our junior bankers and others in the organization who have been working tirelessly to support our clients, and at times have been overburdened, I\u2019ve been passionate about the experience of our junior people throughout my career. As you can now see from our results, client activity is extraordinarily high. And I fully appreciate how busy our people have been. This has been exacerbated by the isolation of working remotely in COVID-19 environment. To address this, we are taking concrete actions including additional hiring, reallocating resources, and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries. In this 24x7 connected world, we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that Goldman Sachs is the place we work very hard to serve our clients but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and wellbeing. In closing, I\u2019m very pleased with how our people delivered for our clients and drove attractive returns for our shareholders. I\u2019m confident in the state of our client franchise and the progress we are making as we execute our strategic priorities. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen.\nStephen Scherr: Thank you, David and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on page 3. During the first quarter, the firm\u2019s performance reflected meaningful strength across all four of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active in raising capital, particularly in the equity markets, and we witnessed high levels of M&A activity amid elevated strategic dialogues. In global markets, we saw strength across all products and regions, as client engagement remained high. In asset management record performance was attributable to gains from our equity investments, particularly as we harvested private equity positions in an attractive market. We also saw double-digit revenue growth year-over-year in our consumer and wealth management segment for the third consecutive quarter as we further expand our wealth capabilities and scale our consumer offering. Turning to specific business performance on page 4, let me begin with investment banking. Investment banking produced record quarterly net revenues of $3.8 billion up 73% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $1.1 billion rose 43% versus last year on increased transaction closings in the quarter. During the quarter, we maintained our number one league table position as we participated in over $400 billion of announced transactions, over $100 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, and closed over 100 deals for approximately $300 billion of deal volume. The bigger headline in investment banking again this quarter was equity underwriting, where we generated a record $1.6 billion in revenues over 4 times greater than the levels the year ago. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting with our volumes climbing to nearly $50 billion across roughly 240 deals, including over 90 initial public offerings, for companies across all markets like Coupang in Korea, InPost in Poland, and Bumble in the U.S. Our equity underwriting market share increased more than 60 basis points during the quarter, largely driven by improved share in IPOs. We experienced strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in a growing number of SPAC transactions. In debt underwriting, net revenues were $880 million, up 51% from a year ago, driven by strong activity levels, particularly in leveraged finance and asset-backed transactions. In addition, our engagement with sectors impacted by COVID, including airlines and hospitality was high. Notwithstanding the significant realization of revenue in a quarter, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at record levels, with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Revenues from corporate lending were $205 million, down 54% versus the first quarter of last year, which included significant gains on hedges maintained with respect to our relationship loan book. Revenues in the quarter reflect net interest income including from transaction banking and fees from relationships lending, partially offset by approximately $85 million of losses on hedges as spreads tightened modestly. Moving to global markets on page 5. Our franchise exhibited broad-based strength across businesses in both FICC and equities. Net revenues were $7.6 billion in the first quarter, up 47% versus a year ago, and the highest since 2010. During the quarter, we benefited from a supportive market-making environment and facilitated considerable client activity. Turning to FICC on page 6. First quarter net revenues were $3.9 billion, up 31% versus a year ago, driven by a 36% increase in intermediation where we experienced healthy client flows and demonstrated strong risk management, and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year. In mortgages, revenues rose significantly, bolstered by solid results in agency mortgages and residential loans and high levels of client engagement as the business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing. In commodities, higher year-on-year performance was driven by solid inventory management across products amid volatile markets and healthy client flows. In rates, revenues rose amid strong risk management and client engagement, particularly on the back of anticipated fiscal activity in the U.S. and diverging central bank actions, during the quarter. In credit, revenues were up versus a year ago as the business benefited from continued improvement in credit spreads, while client activity remained healthy amid robust primary issuance. We also saw increasing volumes related to our automated bond pricing engine and growing activity in electronic trading. In currencies, revenues fell due to lower activity versus a strong quarter a year ago, though client engagement remained high across both the G-10 and emerging markets franchises. Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, up 68% versus a year ago, as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients and intermediated risk with discipline. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 69%, reflecting the global scale and breadth of our client franchise and aided by elevated client volumes across cash and derivatives, as well as strong risk management. In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low touch channels, and executed a number of block trades for clients during the quarter. In derivatives, we produced record results as we saw solid activity in flow and structure transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion were the best in over a decade, rising 65% year-over-year. Average balances in our prime business grew to record levels, as we supported clients amid the volatility and market events of the first quarter. As we continue to grow our prime business, we are well aware of the risks inherent in that business and the resources including liquidity that are consumed. While we avoided losses related to recent events involving Archegos Capital, as David noted, the situation underscored the potential risks of the business and the corresponding importance of our risk infrastructure and control systems. As to forward expectations for global markets, it remains difficult to predict client activity. While we do not expect the pace of activity in the first quarter to necessarily persist for the balance of the year, we believe the high levels of primary issuance, the current trajectory of economic recovery, and diverging central bank policies, particularly in emerging markets, could continue to support elevated client activity. Our confidence on the foreword of global markets rests largely on the market share gains, generated last year through a deepening of client relationships, and our ongoing investment in technology platforms to enhance client experience and drive efficiencies. As we\u2019ve noted previously, this progress has improved the structural return profile of the business, independent of the wallet opportunity. Moving now to asset management on page seven. In the first quarter, we generated record revenues of $4.6 billion. Management and other fees totaled $693 million, up 8% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by fee waivers on money market funds. Incentive fees of $42 million were lower versus a strong year ago quarter. Equity investments produced $3.1 billion of net gains, including appreciation across our public investments and marks related to event-driven activity in our private equity portfolio, such as sales or capital raises. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $340 million. This quarter, we disposed of over $1.5 billion of positions, given attractive market conditions. Despite the quantum of public positions sold in the quarter, the more moderate decline in the size of our portfolio reflects the impacts of IPOs in our private portfolio and market appreciation. Across our $17 billion private equity book, we generated gains of nearly $2.6 billion from various positions, more than two thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $225 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. We announced or closed on dispositions of private assets of $1.5 billion in the quarter, bringing the total private sales since our 2020 Investor Day to $4.7 billion. There is an implied $2.3 billion of capital associated with those assets. Additionally, we have line of sight on nearly $3 billion of incremental asset sales. Despite these actions, and as I mentioned on our January earnings call, we increased the equity attributed to asset management as a result of our 2020 CCAR stress test. This change was driven by our dynamic capital attribution methodology, which takes various regulatory constraints into consideration. On the forward, a continued reduction in balance sheet positions will produce a more meaningful impact on attributed equity reduction. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our net reduction in segment capital, consistent with what we presented at our 2020 Investor Day to below $18 billion by 2024. The ongoing harvesting of our investment portfolio is consistent with our strategy of migrating our business to third-party versus on-balance sheet investing, and attractive market valuations have accelerated some sales. We are keen to continue such activity as it would be capital accretive to the firm. That said, dispositions at attractive levels now, will diminish gains from sales in forward quarters. We are mindful of that trade-off and are working to offset the revenue impact in subsequent years as we look to realize increasing fee income from the number of alternative funds being formed and invested. Finally, in asset management, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $759 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. Let me now turn to page 8, where we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we\u2019ve provided to you in prior quarters. Our equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage, and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with loans in the segment largely secured. Moving to page 9, consumer and wealth management produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 16% versus a year ago. Management and other fees of $1.1 billion rose 12% versus last year, reflecting higher assets under supervision, which rose 25% to $637 billion. Consumer banking revenues grew to $371 million in the first quarter, up 32% versus last year, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit growth. Next, let\u2019s turn to page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision, and firm-wide management and other fees. Total AUS increase to a record $2.2 trillion during the quarter, up over $380 billion versus a year ago. The sequential increase of $59 billion was driven by $37 billion of long-term inflows and $23 billion of liquidity inflows. Our total firm-wide management and other fees grew by 11% versus the first quarter of 2020 to $1.8 billion. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.5 billion for the first quarter, higher versus year-ago, reflecting an increase in interest earning assets and lower funding costs. Next, let\u2019s review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $121 billion, up $5 billion sequentially, driven by residential real estate warehouse and wealth management lending. In the first quarter, provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $70 million. This includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop and loss expectations, partially offset by portfolio growth, including approximately $180 million in provisions related to the pending acquisition of loan receivables as part of our credit card partnership with General Motors expected to launch by year-end. Next, let\u2019s turn to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $9.4 billion. While our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions fell to 34% from 41% in the first quarter of last year, compensation expense increased, reflecting strong performance. Non-compensation expenses were up only 5% versus last year, as increase in transaction-based and technology expenses was largely offset by a decline in litigation, and travel and entertainment expenses, as well as lower expenses related to our consolidated investment entities. Overall, our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 53.3%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business. We remain focused on our expense discipline in a pay for performance culture, as well as our expense initiatives where we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for further savings. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, primarily reflecting the impact of equity-based compensation of approximately $175 million. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21%. I should note that we continue to monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. Turning to our capital levels on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 40 basis points sequentially. The decline was driven by increased lending and higher market RWAs as we stepped into serve clients, partially offset by strong earnings. In the quarter, we returned a total of $3.15 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2.7 billion and approximately $450 million in common stock dividends. Our book value per share rose to a record $250.81. While the Federal Reserve has extended the limitations in place on share repurchases and dividend increases, we nonetheless expect to continue our repurchase plans in the second quarter, close to the levels of the first quarter. And we\u2019ll evaluate an increase to the dividend as permitted. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.3 trillion, 12% higher versus last quarter as we supported client activity. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets, averaging nearly $300 billion. On the liability side, our total deposits rose to $286 billion up $26 billion versus last quarter. Notably consumer deposits surpassed $100 billion during the quarter.  Our long-term debt rose by $6 billion, driven by $20 billion of benchmark issuance, given the growth in our balance sheet outside of bank entities, particularly due to accretive deployment opportunities in our prime business, we now expect benchmark issuances to be modestly higher than maturities and redemptions this year. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We remain confident that execution of our strategic priorities will continue to drive a better client experience, more durable revenues, and strong returns for shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. I appreciate your comments on the capital freed up on the equity investment sales. The question I have is -- I don\u2019t remember every number, but it looks like some of those sales or a lot of those sales came from the older vintages, which is good, I think. But now, with most of the book or all the book six years or younger, does that slow the monetization process? I know you mentioned you had line of sight on $3 billion more. Maybe you could talk about how much capital would be associated with that $3 billion, and maybe how the pipeline looks for third-party capital raise for the remainder of the year?\nStephen Scherr: Sure, Glenn. Thanks for the question. So, let me just go through the numbers, so we\u2019re all level set. In the quarter, we closed on about $1.5 billion of balance sheet reduction producing about $852 million of AE relief. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, since our Investor Day, we\u2019ve disposed of balance sheet positions totaling $4.7 billion that produced about $2.3 billion of relief as well. In terms of line of sight, as I said, we have a view into about $3 billion of balance sheet reduction. My view is that the capital attachment associated with that $3 billion would be, I would say, well in excess of about $1 billion, probably close to $1.4 billion in terms of AE relief there. As to the profile vintage and otherwise, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that in pursuing the strategy of migrating to more third-party funds, we\u2019re going to look across the portfolio, regardless of vintage of opportunities, particularly in this market, to advance. It\u2019s not only in the pursuit of course of that strategy, but equally it reduces the capital density of that business and holds the promise of reduced capital that the firm would be required to hold overall, and so two components in the context of what we\u2019re trying to achieve strategically. If you look at what we\u2019ve done, just on the last part of your question in terms of fundraising, you\u2019ll remember that through 2020, we noted that we had raised funds approximating $40 billion. Taking that and extending it through the first quarter, we\u2019re up just north of about $52 billion and are looking to deploy that now where obviously management fees get paid on deployment and investment of that fundraising. And so, the roster of ambition of what we\u2019re going to do this year is quite real. We\u2019re confident in our ability to achieve it. And this is all obviously part and parcel of meeting what I was talking about, which is as we see the harvest of positions now and take that revenue in, we will see compensation for that, if you will, in the context of management fees as we grow and deploy capital in the alternative space.\nGlenn Schorr: I definitely appreciate all that color. Thank you. Maybe a quick follow-up, just quickly on composition of that pipeline that you talked about. I think, I heard in your remarks that M&A is pretty darn good but underwriting actually is not bad also. I guess, my question is, how dependent is fulfilment of that pipeline on getting past this current SPAC indigestion here that we have? Just looking for a little more color on fulfilment of that pipeline.\nStephen Scherr: Well, if you look at our overall backlog, which as I noted is at record levels, I would say that notwithstanding very high level of revenue recognition certainly in the investment banking segment, we\u2019re nonetheless seeing the backlog replenishment at extraordinarily high levels. And so, that\u2019s really the sort of best picture forward, if you will, in terms of what our clients are engaged in doing. I think, on the forward, as it relates, for example, to global markets, there it\u2019s difficult to say. As I noted in the comment and David did as well, it\u2019s hard to know what the market opportunity will be. The comparative set of results, second and third quarter last year versus this will be challenging just given the volatility we saw last year in those quarters. I think, the confidence we\u2019re taking in terms of sustainability of results lies in our market share, and we have picked up market share across global markets, across investment banking both in financial advisory and equity capital markets, and we will rely on that to capture kind of our fair share or better of the opportunity set presented.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, David and Stephen. And first, let me just echo the sentiments on Heather. She\u2019s been truly exceptional in the IR role, so will be sorely missed. On to my questions, I guess, the first one is on the trading businesses, just to follow up on what you just said in terms of market share gains, it seems like the market share gains are actually accelerating in trading. And I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any more color really on what exactly is driving EBITDA gains in the quarter or over the last year, just a bit more specifics? And then, I know you -- both you and David have talked about the sustainability issue around trading, but it feels like trends are slowing a little bit here in April as we move into the summer, so just any sort of thoughts around what you think will support strength for the rest of the year?\nDavid Solomon: So Christian, I\u2019ll start and thanks for the question. First, I\u2019ll start at a high level and then Stephen will probably give you some more granular data. But at a high level, one of the things we\u2019ve been very focused on over the last 2.5 years is the client centricity of our business and trying to really look at the way clients experience us, look at it holistically, see how we\u2019re serving their needs holistically. You\u2019ve heard us talk about our One GS mantra, our ability to bring the whole organization together to deliver better for clients. And one of the things that I\u2019m hearing consistently from clients as I reach out and spend time with clients is that they feel like there\u2019s been a meaningful change in the kind of broad client service they\u2019re getting, our focus on them, the resources we\u2019re getting, giving -- or bringing to them, and the coordination of all that. And I think that has contributed meaningfully, that client centricity, that culture is contributing meaningfully to market share gains. You know and we\u2019ve put it forward that we talked about looking at the top 100 accounts in global markets. We gave you data last quarter on our progress against those accounts, being top 3 against those accounts. That is a KPI we continue to track. We made progress last year, and we\u2019re committed to making further progress this year. And so, I think that also has an impact on this. In addition, then obviously you have the market activity that\u2019s generated. And so, we get the benefit of those market shares gain against that activity. On your second question with respect to kind of activity looking forward, what I\u2019d say was the first quarter was an extraordinary quarter. I don\u2019t think that the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. But I will say that activity levels continue to be elevated from what I would say was a pre-COVID activity level by a meaningful amount. And I think as we said in the script that the environment, the monetary and fiscal stimulus, and in addition the economic recovery, continues to paint a relatively constructive background. But, I don\u2019t think the expectation should be for it to continue at the pace we saw in the first quarter.\nStephen Scherr: So, Christian, just to pivot off of David\u2019s comments, all of which I\u2019ll give to you and our -- a reflection or a product of the client centricity that David was speaking to. First of all, across the equities business in global markets, I think we\u2019re seeing a very clear consolidation of share in and among a discrete number of banks in the U.S., among which we are one. We saw elevated prime levels, part of the strategy that we\u2019ve been pursuing, and as I noted in my comments, record prime levels that contributed to meaningful uptick in equity financing. Even on the last call, I had noted that over the course of 2020 across global markets, we had picked up about 120 basis points of wallet share across the patch. And then when you look at -- I\u2019ll just take 2 individual businesses in FICC, just to pivot to FICC for a moment. First of all if you look at mortgages, the interesting thing about mortgages is that this business is now sort of pivoted away from sort of straight market-making and is now itself engaged in financing and loan origination. And so doing more for more clients has been kind of the signature, if you will, of just expanding in the mortgage space that has grown that business. And then, if you look at credit, we have picked up meaningful market share, both in cash and loans, in the context of what we\u2019re doing. And then the last thing I would say, which I think is a contributor to enhanced share, client engagement and the like has been what we\u2019ve done in the development of platforms. And credit is a good example of that, where portfolio trading has grown quite considerably. Our place in it is quite high. And so, again it\u2019s all, as David is saying, client centricity and engagement with clients and meeting clients where they care to execute platforms being a good example.\nChristian Bolu: Maybe shifting on to expenses and expense management looking forward. I mean, I\u2019d argue that the opportunity set across pretty much all your businesses today are much bigger than certainly when you -- so much bigger today than when you set out some of those expense targets at Investor Day in early 2020. I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about continuing along the path for those expense targets versus capitalizing on revenue opportunities that are ahead of you?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So the way I would think about expenses is the following. First of all in non-comp expense more broadly, there should be no doubt that we have a very keen focus on controlling our expense base. I\u2019m saying that independent of the efficiencies that we laid out at Investor Day, which I\u2019ll come on to. But our as reported, non-comp expense was up 5%; ex litigation, up 9%. And within that, literally the totality of the increase in expenses were related to transaction-based expenses, so BC&E relating to elevated levels in global markets and our technology spend. And so, I think on the forward, you should expect that where transaction activity is high, where we\u2019re meeting our clients, where market opportunity is large, that variable expense will continue to fluctuate, consistent with the market and will carry us there. The second piece I\u2019ll comment on is just the $1.3 billion of expense initiative. Again, independent of the day-to-day focus on non-comp expense. And there we continue to make progress in all of the areas that we had talked about, including our real estate footprint as we just announced that we\u2019re opening up offices in Birmingham. We did that as it relates to Hyderabad. All of that is a component piece of what we\u2019re trying to achieve in the $1.3 billion of expenses. The last piece I\u2019d say is the operating leverage that exists with compensation. As we\u2019ve said many, many times, we pay for performance. And so, that lever is always available to us as and to the extent we see revenue turn down relative to the kind of performance we\u2019ve otherwise seen in this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So, I wanted to start with a question on capital. Now, how does the Fed decision not to extend SLR relief, inform your capital management priorities? And maybe just give us a sense as to where you\u2019re comfortable running on that measure? Since some of the areas where you noted some gains, like prime are clearly going to be impacted by the prospect of potentially SLR being binding. And then just on risk-based ratios as well, if you could just speak to how you\u2019re thinking about the RWA trajectory as you continue to execute on the planned equity investment sales?\nStephen Scherr: Sure. So, first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco is 6% at the bank. We stand higher than both of the minimums and don\u2019t find that to be a binding constraint to us. And so, I would say that at both levels, we have ample growth capacity in terms of balance sheet growth before that comes on to the horizon as being an issue for us. So SLR, not the issue that it is for some of the other commercial banks. In terms of RWA growth, I think that you\u2019ll see that commensurate with the nature and level of activity that\u2019s there. The one thing I do want to point out is that risk control and risk calibration remains unchanged. It is as disciplined as you would expect it to be, notwithstanding RWA growth. So, the opportunity set that\u2019s been presented causes us to extend balance sheet and grow risk-weighted assets commensurate with that opportunity, but without compromise to the kind of risk levels that we find. I mean, the thing I would say, Steve, on this is that if you look at growth in the firm and you look at growth in balance sheet, in the service of our clients as David\u2019s been talking about, the resource input to this has been maintained so as to protect the risk flank of the firm. We\u2019re sitting with elevated levels of liquidity at GCLA north of $300 billion. We sit in an ample capital position, obviously elevated by where the minimums sit, but within -- in an offensive mode and a buffer prepared to deal and engage with our clients. Marry those two resource sort of points alongside risk controls that David spoke about, and we feel quite comfortable with the RWA growth we\u2019re experiencing and keeping it in control and checked from a risk point of view.\nSteven Chubak: And for my follow-up, I guess, both for you and David, just as a follow-up I guess really to Christian\u2019s earlier question, just on trading and IB normalization. I know this has been asked a number of different ways on recent calls. But just given the sheer pace of share gains and David, some remarks you actually made at a conference this quarter noting that industry fee pool should normalize above 2019 levels, it does feel to us like those two factors alone should support more than $3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading revenues, which actually compares to a target for incumbent business growth of just 2 billion to 3 billion. So, clearly some of the targets that you outlined at Investor Day on the revenue side do appear quite conservative, just given the sheer level of progress. I was hoping you could speak to your confidence around the ability to drive better growth in the incumbent businesses relative to those targets, and maybe if you feel like that north of 3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading is a reasonable expectation, given the underlying trends that you\u2019re seeing as well as the improved and deepened client penetration?\nDavid Solomon: So Steve, I appreciate the question, and you think about this in a similar way that we do. We\u2019ve always talked about how long-term market cap growth has led to long-term growth in our business broadly, but you\u2019ve got to look at it over long periods of time. I think, there are a variety of structural things that has supported growth in our core businesses, and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that. I\u2019m not going to comment specifically on your numbers, although I think that your numbers as you point out set very reasonable expectations for us to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. So I\u2019ll start by saying I am extremely confident of our ability to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. We also said at Investor Day that that is not our longer-term aspirations. And as the market continues to evolve, as we come out of the pandemic, as we have more clarity on how the world sets out moves forward, we\u2019ll give you clearer communication about our longer-term expectations for our ability to drive the franchise forward. But as we did pre-pandemic at Investor Day, I reiterate now, we do see opportunities to drive the franchises forward and drive higher returns over the long term than what our current medium-term targets are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America.\nMike Carrier: First, just a bigger picture question following on that, on that last one. In terms of the sustainability of some of the things that we\u2019re seeing in trading and banking, we haven\u2019t seen this level of GDP growth in terms of the forecasts for a very long time. So, just wanted to get your historical perspective on how this cycle compares and can that drive more activity? And then, David, I think you mentioned higher inflation as one of the risks or something that you\u2019re monitoring. So, I guess, just if we\u2019re in an environment where that starts to ramp up, how do you expect that to impact activity levels?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So, I appreciate the question, Mike. And there\u2019s no question, if you look at a broader historical perspective, growth and activity levels in our business have been correlated to robust GDP growth around the world. And so, I\u2019d state quite clearly, and I said in the prepared remarks, that we think that we\u2019re going to have very, very robust economic growth in the second half of 2021 into 2022 as vaccines continue to accelerate, as we come out of the pandemic, as we move forward. There\u2019s no question that there is meaningful consumer pent-up demand. Consumers have reasonable liquidity and savings higher than they did going into the pandemic. And we expect that all of that economic activity and that pickup in economic activity is a constructive backdrop for our business. There\u2019s no question, given the monetary and fiscal actions, that there\u2019s an increasing risk of inflationary activity. We all are watching very carefully comments from central banks around the world as we look forward. I think in my opinion, there is no question that we will see an increase in inflation. The question is how much, how quickly, and how we respond to that. And I think it\u2019s early -- it\u2019s very early to speculate. But there is a scenario in the distribution where it would accelerate more quickly, and actions would have to be taken that would create more headwinds for our business. I don\u2019t see that as obvious on the near-term horizon as we look through this year and we continue to come out of the pandemic. But I do think it\u2019s a risk issue for markets that we\u2019ll have to continue to watch very closely.\nMike Carrier: Stephen, just a quick one follow-up on the asset management business following Glenn\u2019s question. Just the fees, the management fees sequentially were a bit lower. I think you mentioned money market fee waivers. How significant was that? And then on the alternative fund-raising, how much of the funds that are being raised do you generate fees on committed capital versus deployed capital?\nStephen Scherr: Yes. So, on the money market comment, it was approximately $100 million in fee waivers. And bear in mind, very common practice, as you know, throughout the industry. So, nothing unusual about that. On the alternatives space, the management fees that we\u2019ll take in are on deployment of the investable capital that\u2019s already beginning. And so, you\u2019ll continue to see that. I did note that on one of the charts that we show, which looks at firm-wide assets under supervision and firm-wide management and other fees, it\u2019s a slide where my ambition is to disclose more. Particularly as these alternative funds become deployed, we can start to share more with you about how much of that management fee across the whole of the business, never mind the segment in which it sits, but across the whole of the firm, is being generated by this strategic pivot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Two questions, the first one is on the backlog. You indicated that the backlog is I think you mentioned historic levels. But, I\u2019m just trying to understand how much -- like what\u2019s the multiple of the prior peak that your backlog is running at right now?\nStephen Scherr: Yes. I would say that I\u2019d have to go back and look at where the sort of prior record was set, but it\u2019s certainly at a record. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of composition in it, which is that it\u2019s cutting across a range of businesses. We\u2019re seeing higher-than-normal replenishment and backlog build in EMEA and in Asia than we are in the Americas. But bear in mind, overall size of the business in the Americas is quite significant. So, notional dollars would be higher there, but it\u2019s showing some geographic composition. To my memory, I wouldn\u2019t view it as a multiple to prior peak. I would call it as probably 10% higher than where the top of that number had been historically.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then separately, Steve, I think you mentioned a comment about the dividend and you would look to raise that as soon as you could. Could you give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the sizing of that is? Typically, people look at the dividend payout ratio relative to estimated forward earnings. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the metric that you\u2019re thinking about, but if you can give us some color. Because of the revenue volatility that you have, some pieces lower, some pieces higher, maybe give us a sense as to what we should be keying in on when we\u2019re thinking about where to take dividend in our estimates.\nStephen Scherr: Yes. So I don\u2019t want to peg the exact sort of aspiration of where we\u2019ll be, and our ambition is to take the dividend up when the rules permit. But I would say that our ambition is to put the dividend in a more competitive standing than perhaps where it has sat historically. By the way, we\u2019ve already been on that path, having raised the dividend quite considerably since David and John and I all took our seats. And so, to my memory, we took it up about 47% or thereabout at the beginning of our tenure, and higher since. I think, the ambition here is to have the dividend grow commensurate with an increasing durability of revenues in the business. As the more durable businesses or revenue streams and businesses grow, the dividend ought to reflect that, and it will. And so, that\u2019s probably the best sort of forward view on dividend thinking that I can provide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Can you just give more color on -- it looks like market share gains, but maybe by different category. So, one category would be size of client. I know you have this middle market expansion effort. Was that a record, and how is that doing? A second category could be kind of corporate versus others. A couple of years ago, you were behind with the corporates. You were trying to catch up. And a third category would be geographic. You mentioned EMEA and Asia on a go-forward basis, but just as we look at the first quarter.\nStephen Scherr: So, we don\u2019t break down the backlog exactly that way, but let me just provide as much color as I can on this. First of all in the middle market, that continues to grow. And the revenue that we\u2019ve taken in, in investment banking around the growth in the client set has been quite substantial, and frankly I think beyond that which we otherwise thought we would achieve at the Investor Day. On the corporate side, you can see it play out in the context of investment banking revenues broadly. I would say equally, we\u2019re playing to a larger corporate set in our global market segment in terms of those becoming more prolific clients in what we do. And then, on the geography, as I mentioned before, we have seen kind of double-digit growth in backlog in EMEA and in Asia. And we continue to see growth in the Americas as well. But again, the Americas presents a much larger set more broadly. I\u2019d also refer you back to a comment David made and we\u2019ve spoken about before, which is our ambition and our focus around client centricity in global markets. It\u2019s always been there as it relates to investment banking, has put us in among the top 3 among 64 of the most prolific clients, top 100 clients in global markets, and that\u2019s up from 51 the year before. And so, we continue to see growth in the share we\u2019re taking. By the way, this is all against the backdrop of consolidation in share, I would say, among U.S. banks relative to the European competitors across a range of product areas in equities and in FICC.\nMike Mayo: And you mentioned record prime balances. So, after the recent hedge fund incident, do you see some players retreating, and there you\u2019d have a flight-to-quality effect with players coming to you, or is something else taking place?\nStephen Scherr: I mean, I think it\u2019s too early to judge whether there\u2019ll be a significant shift. I suspect that there\u2019ll be certain clients that look to migrate from where they were to a different firm, but it\u2019s too early to judge that. I think, the important thing to note is that growth in prime has been a strategic imperative for us. It\u2019s not the by-product of the Archegos incident or the like. And as we grow that, and this is what David was referring to, we continue to maintain quite a vigilant posture as it relates to risk that\u2019s embedded in it. We recognize risk of concentration. We recognize the consumptive nature of that business. And so, we\u2019re going to maintain kind of our threshold of risk tolerance in terms of clients that we bring on. Whether or not it shows consolidation in prime, pricing pressure in prime, I suspect it might, but it\u2019s just too early to judge that just yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JP Morgan.\nKian Abouhossein: Yes. Hi. First of all, thanks to Heather for all her support. I have two questions. The first one relates to global markets. You clearly indicated that this has been fueled by the very strong liquidity macro environment that we\u2019ve seen. And clearly, all sublines have performed extremely, both last year and the first quarter. And I wanted to understand how you make decisions about spending additional dollars in terms of investments structurally in these businesses, considering everything is performing extremely well and most likely asking for budget. So, if you can just talk about the business lines that you\u2019re investing as well as the geography.\nStephen Scherr: Well, the one that I would call out is credit in FICC just as an example, and I mentioned it earlier. So, this is where we saw a trend line developing around portfolio trading. And so, investments that we were making in platforms and technology capabilities and the like have served us well in the capture of a solid percentage of the portfolio trading and the volumes that are going through there. And so, that\u2019s an example of advancing and enhancing our technology capabilities that are in place. I\u2019d also point out more generally that over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been spending quite a bit of money on straight-through processing. That is, taking note of the demands among our clients around middle and back office and the overall experience of our clients set not just on the front end of the trade, but all through to the back. Each of those investments, whether it\u2019s technology to build platforms that captures portfolio trading credit, or development of enhanced technology to automate and streamline the overall straight-through processing, all of that is subject to an ROI framework with an eye toward improving the overall client and user experience that\u2019s there. And so, that\u2019s just a little bit of insight into how we think about the investment and where we\u2019ve been making that investment.\nKian Abouhossein: And my second question is coming back to technology. Stephen, you also mentioned in your remarks, clearly the focus on technology platforms and the front office experience for clients that you have improved and are improving. But maybe you could elaborate a little bit more in detail. For example, how much of your business is cloud based? How much do you want to get to cloud? How many platforms do you have on the trading side, and how many do you envision to have in the future? And on the front office side, we hear from a lot of banks that they\u2019re very good at the new platform operations that they are dealing with. But just wondering what is the experience at Goldman that makes it so different, in your view.\nStephen Scherr: Well, I\u2019m not sure I have it at my hand kind of the number of systems and the like. But let me answer the question this way, and let me use transaction banking as being a really good example, okay? Transaction banking is a new platform designed from the front end all the way through to the back, into the books and records of the firm. It is cloud-based engineering, which has all the efficiencies that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of in terms of a lower expense to sort of keep it current in terms of developments around engineering and the like. And so, our new builds are largely, perhaps not exclusively, but largely cloud-based. We\u2019re always looking to rationalize platforms. And I would say one thing I\u2019ve learned from Marco Argenti and George in engineering is that it\u2019s as important to decommission old platforms as it is to put new ones in. We\u2019re riveted and focused on doing that so as to eliminate legacy technology, build in the cloud. And I think some of the newer businesses that we\u2019re involved in, transaction banking consumer, benefit from the absence of legacy, so that we can build new and efficiently and in the right form.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Just curious that you guys are building out -- Marcus is a big strategic priority for you. You rolled out the Marcus Invest. We\u2019ve got check writing coming. When we look at some of the fintech platforms and what they\u2019ve embraced recently, there\u2019s been a lot of excitement around offering crypto. You made a few comments on crypto and the outlook for how to engage in crypto in your institutional business. But, are you also considering including the offering of crypto wallets and whatnot on the consumer front, where it seems as though there might be -- but certainly competitors have found an ability to offer that capability, which has driven a lot of excitement and a lot of growth?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I appreciate the question, Brennan. And at a high level, obviously we\u2019re monitoring this all very quickly. We have a plan at the moment to build a digital bank that\u2019s offering an array of integrated basic services in a completely digital, frictionless platform. And we\u2019re extremely focused on that. At the moment, we are not focused on offering a crypto wallet ahead of providing what I\u2019ll call more basic set of financial services on a digital platform. We\u2019ll obviously monitor how the world evolves with this. We\u2019ll see how things progress and we\u2019ll continue to watch it. But I\u2019m not going to comment further on longer term plans for individuals. We\u2019ve been focused on other things. And with respect to crypto, payment systems, the digitization of money, we\u2019ve been much more focused on the institutional side.\nBrennan Hawken: That\u2019s fair. Thanks. Walk before you run, maybe a little different than some of the fintech competitors. Anyway, let\u2019s see, broadening it out a little bit and thinking about your strategic targets and the new directions that you\u2019re going. Stephen, you often flag the components and how much of the revenue is recurring, which it\u2019s probably underappreciated. Have you considered -- you guys have done a lot with disclosure, and it\u2019s been great and very constructive. Have you considered making some adjustments in the disclosures, which would help investors and analysts to model some of those recurring revenues and show them as more mechanical, so to speak? For example with consumer banking -- I mean consumer banking is the one that seems much clear to me. You just provide the revenue line, but we don\u2019t know what the breakdown is in fees versus NII. We don\u2019t know what the direct balances are tied to that. We don\u2019t know credit metrics that would allow for some sort of more mechanical calculations, and I think might assist in the appreciation of how much of your revenue base is actually recurring amongst the analysts and investor community. Have you considered any of those changes or shifts? And do you think that might help in greater appreciation of those recurring revenue streams?\nStephen Scherr: So Brennan, first of all, thanks for the feedback. I mean, it\u2019s a big area of focus for us. The strategy has clearly been to develop out businesses that exhibit greater durability to the revenue stream. And there\u2019s no question that disclosure will follow, in the context of providing all of you with greater insight into where we think or where we would define recurring and durability of earnings that are there. On the specific points you raised around consumer, I think as consumer grows, and so David was reflecting before that that business is now turning a corner to sort of resemble the ambition of a broader platform than it is a series of products. We\u2019d like to find ourselves in a place where we will and can provide greater disclosure on consumer, just as an example. I would say, the same will be true as transaction banking becomes more durable. These are areas where as they become more material, and we expect that they will, disclosure will naturally follow. And then, I think your feedback is a good one, just in the context of providing a firm-wide perspective through disclosure on durability.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: A question here just on kind of the M&A environment, obviously a lot of activity going on in financials and fintech right now. So, I\u2019d love to maybe just get some perspective on what you guys are seeing within Goldman specifically in terms of opportunities and what the appetite is, and also whether anything has changed? Clearly, the stock is at kind of a new level here. It\u2019s up 30% year-to-date, still only maybe 10x earnings, but we\u2019re at levels that you haven\u2019t been at. So, I\u2019d just love to maybe get some context on the backdrop overall and then maybe how the appetite might be evolving.\nDavid Solomon: I appreciate the question, Devin. On the backdrop overall, I assume by the backdrop overall, you\u2019re just talking about broad M&A activity. There\u2019s been a meaningful pickup as confidence in the forward has increased. And the comments that Stephen made about backlog broadly and the constructive nature of this environment is obviously leading to clients being extremely engaged around strategic objectives that allow them to drive their businesses forward. Really in all businesses everywhere, we continue to see consolidation of those in a strong -- with consolidation by those that are in a strong position. Because all businesses continue in the digital world we\u2019re in with further digitization require more tech investment, more scale, more global. And so, in that context, obviously leaders are continuing to consolidate their strong positions. With respect to our space broadly and how we think about this, I\u2019m going to repeat verbatim what I said last quarter, and what I\u2019ve said before. We spend a lot of time looking at opportunities to accelerate the growth of our franchise. In particular as we look at businesses like asset management and wealth, if we could find something that we felt would accelerate our strategic growth objectives, we would certainly consider it. But the bar for anything significant is high. And it has to be the right industrial logic more than the fact that we have a currency because the stock is higher. And so, we continue to think about ways that we could accelerate our growth, but the bar to do it is high. Prices are high. It\u2019s a competitive environment. And we feel good about our plan, but we\u2019ll continue to do the work and be diligent about looking for opportunities where we can accelerate the growth of the firm.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. And then, just a follow-up here, we\u2019ve received some investor questions just over some of the recent press reports around some management movement or departures even in some of the newer businesses. And I think the question is more, clearly Goldman has a deep bench and is a large organization, so sometimes I think the context gets lost. But, the question is more around whether there\u2019s any implication of a strategy evolution or shifts from at least what some of the press is picking up. I\u2019d love to just get a comment if you can on that.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. We feel very, very good about our team that\u2019s in place. We have a very, very deep bench. And I think we\u2019re in a great position with the leaders that are in place. One of the things I just observe broadly, and it\u2019s consistent with our performance, it\u2019s consistent with stock market values and prices, it\u2019s consistent with the environment that we\u2019re in, there is a lot of activity in the world. There\u2019s a lot of liquidity in the world. And the world is very, very competitive for great talent. We\u2019ve always been a developer of strong talent, and we\u2019ve always been a place where people come to look for great talent. There\u2019s nothing about any of the attrition this year that looks extraordinary when you look back over a multiyear basis. And I think we\u2019re very well positioned, but there are a lot of opportunities out there. And at times as I said in my script, people will go choose other things because they have bigger opportunities, and we welcome that. Often, they become clients when they make these moves. We rarely lose people to competitors. So, I feel good about where we sit from a talent perspective. I feel good about the interest that we\u2019re finding people have in coming to be a part of Goldman Sachs and join the journey that we\u2019re on to continue to grow the firm.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys give us a little more color? I think, you touched on when you\u2019re permitted to increase the dividend, which I would assume would be third quarter when we go to the stress capital buffer construct, that that might be an opportunity for the Board to take up a dividend increase. But, in terms of just with your CET1 ratio, I believe at Investor Day I think you guys said the medium-term target was 13% to 13.5%. Could you share with us how you expect to manage to that number with share repurchases, once we get into the stress capital buffer construct?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I think the way to think about it is that share repurchase is going to follow kind of a longstanding philosophy where we look at opportunities across the firm to deploy capital and where those returns are attractive as they have been this past quarter, we\u2019ll continue to do that. Where we don\u2019t, we will look to return capital back in the form of share repurchase, with the dividend obviously being a reflection, as I commented earlier, of greater confidence and a more durable set of revenues and that net dividend increase to reflect it. On the achievement of the 13% to 13.5%, I would say that the lever is honestly less about share repurchase and more about what we\u2019re doing to alter the capital consumptive density of the firm. So, key among those initiatives sits in asset management, where the pivot from on-balance sheet to third-party fund is as much about creating a durable, more predictable revenue stream as it is lowering the capital density of that business, and therefore of the firm. And to the extent that happens, we will be doing ourselves the favor of reducing capital intensity. But my expectation is that the Fed will recognize it equally and subsequent CCAR exams will reflect it as lowering of the requirement that we ultimately will have. And it\u2019s on top of that that we\u2019ll maintain what I view, we view, as an offensive buffer to deploy capital for clients. So, less about share repurchase, more about fundamental shifts in change that we\u2019re bringing to the business, both to help ourselves and frankly speaking, to enable the Fed to come to a realization of the lower capital consumption profile of the business.\nGerard Cassidy: And then, to follow up, the outlook that you guys have described is quite positive. The Federal Reserve has pointed out there\u2019s going to be strong growth this year for this economy, the global economy as well, as we all are expecting. Aside from the pandemic taking a reversal and it sets us all back and aside from a recession, what -- and I know, David, you already touched on inflation as being a risk. What are some of risks that you keep your eyes on that could kind of set the outlook back, maybe not as robust as it appears to be for you and some of your peers today?\nDavid Solomon: Well, there\u2019s risk in markets constantly. And part of markets and economic growth is rooted to confidence. And things can go wrong -- things can go wrong at any time. And things tend to pop up in places that you don\u2019t see or you don\u2019t expect. I think, we have a very, very constructive environment, Gerard, given that the world is dominated by the pandemic and dominated by the actions that central banks and governments are taking to respond to the pandemic. The weightiness of that, the heft of that really overshadows most else that\u2019s going on. I do think over time, we\u2019ll be having discussions about the increase in government debt and government spending around the world. There will be consequence to that. That can obviously have an impact over time. There\u2019s a general view at the moment that rates are going to be low for very, very long. Certainly, given some of the actions that are taken, you could see a scenario where the perspective on that would change and could change quickly. And that would certainly create headwinds to growth and headwinds to activity. But I do think we have a very, very good backdrop at the moment with a higher probability or distribution of strong economic growth, because we had such a sharp reaction to the other side, given the pandemic. And the unwind of that I think will dominate as we move through the rest of the year into next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: I had a question on the prime book. I know it says that you\u2019re at a record in the first quarter of this year. But, is there a way to frame like the overall exposure from prime? Kind of like what the balance sheet exposure is? What the market shares are from that business?\nStephen Scherr: Well, kind of hard to put precision around that. I would simply say that we have made it, as I\u2019ve said, a strategic priority to grow prime balances. I would say that our business has skewed historically more to the long short, and less so competitively relative to the comp -- to the quants. But our ambition is to continue to grow it. But as I said before, that growth is not going to happen absent corresponding risk insight into how that book grows. We\u2019re very, very aware of the embedded risk in it. We\u2019re very aware of the liquidity consumption in that book. And so, we mind ourselves as we grow volumes in that. But it\u2019s been part and parcel again to the theme of durability around financing that goes on in and around that business. And so, the balances have grown consistent with that.\nDavid Solomon: And the only other comment I\u2019d make, Brian, around the business is that there is a clear consolidation going on with the leaders because of scale, because of technology capability. And I think we\u2019re well positioned for that trend if that trend continues going forward.\nBrian Kleinhanzl: And maybe another look at the prime business though. Is there any way to frame kind of where leverage is on the underlying client level today versus where it was pre-COVID? I mean, are we seeing a lot of massive increase in leverage versus where we were before?\nStephen Scherr: Well, I would say -- I mean, listen. It depends a lot on the collateral pool that you have. Let me describe it this way. It\u2019s hard for us to know what goes on in every other bank around the street. I can only speak to what we know and watch inside of Goldman Sachs. And so, what David was describing, particularly around Archegos, the story is less about the events of Archegos as much as how we\u2019re set up to monitor it. And so, we look at consolidated or overly consolidated concentrated positions in individual accounts. We look for excessive position concentration across the whole of our business. We look and undertake a daily mark-to-market on collateral and corresponding margin. And in tracking concentration and correlation, we adjust what it is that we\u2019re doing, the level of margin we take, the clients we take in, the pricing we put against that prime. Those are all the important inputs in terms of how we grow that business broadly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Maybe just talking a little bit about the implications of the explosive growth in the SPAC market. You guys have had pretty good market share there. I guess, number one, do you think -- there\u2019s clearly a lot of pent-up demand for M&A that has to get done in the next 24 months. Does that make you even more excited about the M&A prospects for you and the industry? And should we see a subsequent sort of cooling off in the underwriting side, just because the demand -- the amount of capital-chasing deals seems very high?\nDavid Solomon: So, a couple of comments at a high level. I mean, there\u2019s no question that given the number of SPACs that have been raised, the incentives that are set certainly lead to all those sponsors to look for deals actively. Given our position in the M&A market, that should be a tailwind. That said, just to quantify it, when you look at our M&A activity, that M&A activity for us with SPACs last quarter, I think it was a single-digit percentage of the M&A activity that we participated in. So, while it\u2019s a tailwind, I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s dominating the M&A activity and the positive constructive comments we made around M&A. In fact, that\u2019s really rooted in much more broad strategic activity that we\u2019ve seen a big pickup in over the course of the last 6 to 9 months. With respect to underwriting activity, there\u2019s no question that it has slowed from the peak of where it was. I think there\u2019s a little indigestion in the context of that. You\u2019ve obviously seen returns and some of the shells kind of slowed at this point. I\u2019d also highlight just again kind of backlog, that when you look at ECM revenue last quarter, SPACs were less than 15% of our ECM revenue last quarter. So, this all creates a tailwind. But my guess is in this quarter, you\u2019ll see less new issuance than what we saw in the first quarter. And you\u2019ll see a continued progress that people try to find M&A targets to destack. All of that should be constructive for our business.\nJim Mitchell: And as a follow-up, do you see any sort of longer-term good or bad with -- you noted that it\u2019s an innovation that\u2019s probably here to stay. Do you see it a net positive for the investment banking industry, or just it\u2019s another quiver in for financing?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think it\u2019s another form of capital formation and financing. But what I tried to highlight in my remarks, Jim, is that I think it\u2019s going to continue to evolve. I think there\u2019s room for improvement in disclosures, and you\u2019ll see us continue to push to improve disclosures. I think, you\u2019ll see different structures around incentive alignment for sponsors, and I think you\u2019ll see an evolution in that. So, like any other innovation,, they evolve, they mature. But I do think capital formation that leads to more liquidity in markets and more opportunities for investors to participate is generally a good thing. But how it\u2019s done, the disclosure around it, the incentives, the transparency, all those things are things where I think there\u2019s room for progress around this innovation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with Exane.\nJeremy Sigee: I just wanted to go back to the Archegos comments you were making early on and what it means for the prime brokerage business more broadly. And I just wondered if you could comment on how unusual Archegos was compared to other funds that you do business with in prime brokerage in terms of their leverage or their investment position? So, was this an ordinary situation, like multiple others that you do business with that just went wrong, or was this some kind of real outlier to start with?\nDavid Solomon: At a high level, in a high level, Jeremy, it\u2019s hard to make generalizations around these things. But I think what was unusual here was for a variety of reasons. This particular fund wound up with very concentrated positions very quickly, and I think that was unusual. And then, the actions that they chose to take, or chose not to take, obviously affected the outcome. But,, I think it was unusual with respect to the size and the concentration of positions, which changed relatively quickly.\nJeremy Sigee: And just to follow up, do you expect any change in how you do business as a result of this incident, or how the industry does business, either in terms of risk limits, margin levels, capital requirements, either that you determine or that maybe the regulators are going to determine for this business?\nDavid Solomon: I think, we always look at every experience we have on a day-to-day basis, and we always try to learn and we always adjust. And there\u2019s no question that we spent a lot of time looking at this, even though I feel that we executed very well here. We got this one right. We don\u2019t always get everything right. So we always look at every situation to try to tweak and improve our risk management processes and how we think about these things. I do think that there -- given the visibility of this, I do think there\u2019ll be regulatory discussion around it. As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ll participate constructively in those discussions. But, I think it\u2019s too early to speculate one way or another whether it will have any impact. I do think to some degree, this was a one-off event. But as I said earlier, we will see from time to time people get overly concentrated. They have too much leverage, and that leads to unwinds.\nStephen Scherr: Well, since there are no more questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to Carey and the IR team. Otherwise, please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Heather, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Before I begin my remarks, let me thank Heather for leading the firm's Investor Relations effort for the past four years and welcome Carey to the role. I will begin on page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results. In the first quarter, we produced record net revenues of $17.7 billion. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident as we delivered net earnings of $6.8 billion, record quarterly earnings per share of $18.60, and a return on equity of 31% and a return on tangible equity of 32.9% the highest in over a decade. Our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength of our franchise in the supportive environment which we operated during the quarter. These results also evidenced our successful execution towards the firm's strategic priorities. We maintained our leading global positions across M&A and equity underwriting. We delivered the best performance in global markets in a decade with strength in FICC and equities driven by solid client activity across our platform and reinforced by last year's market share gains. In asset management, we recognized significant net gains across our public and private equity positions, and we continued to harvest on-balance sheet investments in our efforts to transition the business to more third-party assets, where we are making progress in raising funds across a range of investing strategies. In Wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra-high net worth PWM clients, while we further scale our personal financial management business. And in Consumer, we continue to make strong progress on our vision to create the leading digital consumer banking platform. This quarter, we launched Marcus Invest in the U.S., our digital investment offering, which provides consumers access to diversified investment portfolios with as little as a $1,000 investment. The customer response and uptake since launch has been positive and we are focused on scaling the platform. We're also working towards the launch of digital checking in the U.S. and Marcus Invest in the UK. Importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet as we continue to deploy our resources to support clients amid an evolving and dynamic market backdrop. With that, let me turn now to the operating environment on page 2. As anticipated, we saw improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop during the first quarter, which was supported by the continued accommodative fiscal and monetary policies of central banks and governments around the world. At this stage, it is clear to me that the U.S. is poised for a strong recovery this year, led by consumer spending that is rebounding to pre-COVID levels. This sentiment is reflected in the capital markets with U.S. equities hovering at or near records and bolstered by recent U.S. employment data and our economists' forecast on GDP growth. Despite these positive developments, we recognized that the operating backdrop will undoubtedly evolve and that much of the global economic recovery will depend on the progress around COVID-19. While the rollout of vaccines is well underway in the U.S. and the UK, distribution has been challenged in a number of other countries around the globe, and the prospect of new variants add to potential concerns around the trajectory of the economic recovery. As you would expect, we remain vigilant to risks across markets. We are mindful of elevated valuation levels across certain asset classes, increased volatility in certain single name stocks, and are aware of the inflationary risks inherent in the actions being taken to stimulate continued growth in the economy. Let me now also take a moment to share my views on a few important topics while I've been fielding questions from clients and other stakeholders. First, on the events related to Archegos Capital, this was a case of an investor with highly concentrated and leveraged positions. This is not the first time we've seen a situation like this, and it likely won't be the last. We have robust risk management that governs the amount of financing we provide for these types of portfolios. Our risk controls, all of which were put in place long before the March events, worked well. We identified the risk early and took prompt action consistent with the terms of our contract with the client. I am pleased with how the firm handled it, and And it's a reflection of the engagement and communication of teams across Goldman Sachs, both in the business and on the control side of our firm. These events raised reasonable questions around market practice and transparency. They are worthy of debate, and we intend to play a constructive role in that dialog. Next on SPACs, we continue to believe that providing sponsors a mechanism to access public markets for capital formation is an innovation that's here to stay. However, as a meaningful participant in this market, we will continue to be thoughtful regarding the transactions we underwrite, with a particular focus on the quality of sponsors, sponsor economics, investor protections, and disclosure. We believe the industry should evolve on these important issues in the interest of more efficient and transparent markets. I also want to touch on the topics of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the digitization of money. As activities in these areas progress, there will be a significant disruption and change in the way money moves around the world. Many central banks are looking at digital currencies and working to apply this technology to their local markets and determine the longer term impact on global payment systems. There's also significant focus on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where the trajectory is less clear as market participants evaluate their possibility as a store of value. At Goldman Sachs, we continue to look for ways to expand our capabilities to support our client needs and evaluate applications to improve our organizational efficiency. Of course, we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines. For example, we cannot own Bitcoin or trade it as principal. Goldman Sachs will play a role in these innovations as they are important to our clients and important to the future of global financial systems. Another topic coming up in stakeholder conversations is sustainability. We remain steadfast in our commitments to sustainable finance. Central to our purpose as an organization, our programs are commercially attractive and utilize our expertise and capital to support all of our stakeholders. During the quarter, we issued our first sustainability bond, where we raised $800 million, the proceeds of which will be allocated towards initiatives aimed at accelerating climate transition and advancing inclusive growth. We also launched One Million Black Women, an initiative that I'm very proud of and through which the firm will commit $10 billion of direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital for capacity building grants over the next decade to narrow the opportunity gaps for black women in the United States. Separately, we also committed an additional $500 million to \u2018Launch With GS', our program designed to invest in diversified companies and fund managers, bringing our total commitments to $1 billion. Finally, I want to take a few minutes to comment on our people. I continue to hear from clients that the quality and dedication of our people is one of our great differentiators. The firm's quarterly results are product of our client focus and the dedication of the employees of Goldman Sachs, day in and day out. Notwithstanding the challenges that they have all faced as we mark one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, our people have rallied to the needs of our clients. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world. I am in awe of their performance and of our results this quarter due to their hard work, dedication and our culture of teamwork. It will always be a priority for our firm to attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients and execute on our strategy. We have a vibrant partnership and a deep bench of talent across the organization. Many will spend their entire career with us. Some will even become clients of the firm. This is a virtuous ecosystem that has been in place for decades. It is also aligned with the evolution of our partnership strategy where we're working to continue to make the partnership more aspirational. I recognize there's an enormous amount of discussion about how companies will operate their businesses post pandemic. For Goldman Sachs, our people operate at their best when they are forging close bonds with colleagues and furthering the apprenticeship culture that has defined us. We have found the best way to do that is to work together in person on a regular basis. Let me be clear, achieving the objective of bringing our colleagues back to the office is not inconsistent with the desire to provide our people with the flexibility they need to manage the personal and professional lives, which is the way we have always run this firm. And given the experience of the past year, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to facilitate this approach going forward. Over the course of the past few months, we've been welcoming thousands of colleagues back to the office in a manner consistent with safety guidelines in each city in which we operate. We have implemented testing and other protocols across our offices to make for a safer work environment and to provide those returning to the office with a sense of confidence in the return. Importantly, I look forward to increasing number of employees returning as vaccination programs around the world expand, and we welcome new joiners to the firm's offices this summer. Regarding our junior bankers and others in the organization who have been working tirelessly to support our clients, and at times have been overburdened, I've been passionate about the experience of our junior people throughout my career. As you can now see from our results, client activity is extraordinarily high. And I fully appreciate how busy our people have been. This has been exacerbated by the isolation of working remotely in COVID-19 environment. To address this, we are taking concrete actions including additional hiring, reallocating resources, and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries. In this 24x7 connected world, we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that Goldman Sachs is the place we work very hard to serve our clients but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and wellbeing. In closing, I'm very pleased with how our people delivered for our clients and drove attractive returns for our shareholders. I'm confident in the state of our client franchise and the progress we are making as we execute our strategic priorities. With that, I will turn it over to Stephen. So Christian, I'll start and thanks for the question. First, I'll start at a high level and then Stephen will probably give you some more granular data. But at a high level, one of the things we've been very focused on over the last 2.5 years is the client centricity of our business and trying to really look at the way clients experience us, look at it holistically, see how we're serving their needs holistically. You've heard us talk about our One GS mantra, our ability to bring the whole organization together to deliver better for clients. And one of the things that I'm hearing consistently from clients as I reach out and spend time with clients is that they feel like there's been a meaningful change in the kind of broad client service they're getting, our focus on them, the resources we're getting, giving -- or bringing to them, and the coordination of all that. And I think that has contributed meaningfully, that client centricity, that culture is contributing meaningfully to market share gains. You know and we've put it forward that we talked about looking at the top 100 accounts in global markets. We gave you data last quarter on our progress against those accounts, being top 3 against those accounts. That is a KPI we continue to track. We made progress last year, and we're committed to making further progress this year. And so, I think that also has an impact on this. In addition, then obviously you have the market activity that's generated. And so, we get the benefit of those market shares gain against that activity. On your second question with respect to kind of activity looking forward, what I'd say was the first quarter was an extraordinary quarter. I don't think that the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. But I will say that activity levels continue to be elevated from what I would say was a pre-COVID activity level by a meaningful amount. And I think as we said in the script that the environment, the monetary and fiscal stimulus, and in addition the economic recovery, continues to paint a relatively constructive background. But, I don't think the expectation should be for it to continue at the pace we saw in the first quarter. So Steve, I appreciate the question, and you think about this in a similar way that we do. We've always talked about how long-term market cap growth has led to long-term growth in our business broadly, but you've got to look at it over long periods of time. I think, there are a variety of structural things that has supported growth in our core businesses, and I think we're seeing some of that. I'm not going to comment specifically on your numbers, although I think that your numbers as you point out set very reasonable expectations for us to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. So I'll start by saying I am extremely confident of our ability to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. We also said at Investor Day that that is not our longer-term aspirations. And as the market continues to evolve, as we come out of the pandemic, as we have more clarity on how the world sets out moves forward, we'll give you clearer communication about our longer-term expectations for our ability to drive the franchise forward. But as we did pre-pandemic at Investor Day, I reiterate now, we do see opportunities to drive the franchises forward and drive higher returns over the long term than what our current medium-term targets are. Sure. So, I appreciate the question, Mike. And there's no question, if you look at a broader historical perspective, growth and activity levels in our business have been correlated to robust GDP growth around the world. And so, I'd state quite clearly, and I said in the prepared remarks, that we think that we're going to have very, very robust economic growth in the second half of 2021 into 2022 as vaccines continue to accelerate, as we come out of the pandemic, as we move forward. There's no question that there is meaningful consumer pent-up demand. Consumers have reasonable liquidity and savings higher than they did going into the pandemic. And we expect that all of that economic activity and that pickup in economic activity is a constructive backdrop for our business. There's no question, given the monetary and fiscal actions, that there's an increasing risk of inflationary activity. We all are watching very carefully comments from central banks around the world as we look forward. I think in my opinion, there is no question that we will see an increase in inflation. The question is how much, how quickly, and how we respond to that. And I think it's early -- it's very early to speculate. But there is a scenario in the distribution where it would accelerate more quickly, and actions would have to be taken that would create more headwinds for our business. I don't see that as obvious on the near-term horizon as we look through this year and we continue to come out of the pandemic. But I do think it's a risk issue for markets that we'll have to continue to watch very closely. Sure. I appreciate the question, Brennan. And at a high level, obviously we're monitoring this all very quickly. We have a plan at the moment to build a digital bank that's offering an array of integrated basic services in a completely digital, frictionless platform. And we're extremely focused on that. At the moment, we are not focused on offering a crypto wallet ahead of providing what I'll call more basic set of financial services on a digital platform. We'll obviously monitor how the world evolves with this. We'll see how things progress and we'll continue to watch it. But I'm not going to comment further on longer term plans for individuals. We've been focused on other things. And with respect to crypto, payment systems, the digitization of money, we've been much more focused on the institutional side. I appreciate the question, Devin. On the backdrop overall, I assume by the backdrop overall, you're just talking about broad M&A activity. There's been a meaningful pickup as confidence in the forward has increased. And the comments that Stephen made about backlog broadly and the constructive nature of this environment is obviously leading to clients being extremely engaged around strategic objectives that allow them to drive their businesses forward. Really in all businesses everywhere, we continue to see consolidation of those in a strong -- with consolidation by those that are in a strong position. Because all businesses continue in the digital world we're in with further digitization require more tech investment, more scale, more global. And so, in that context, obviously leaders are continuing to consolidate their strong positions. With respect to our space broadly and how we think about this, I'm going to repeat verbatim what I said last quarter, and what I've said before. We spend a lot of time looking at opportunities to accelerate the growth of our franchise. In particular as we look at businesses like asset management and wealth, if we could find something that we felt would accelerate our strategic growth objectives, we would certainly consider it. But the bar for anything significant is high. And it has to be the right industrial logic more than the fact that we have a currency because the stock is higher. And so, we continue to think about ways that we could accelerate our growth, but the bar to do it is high. Prices are high. It's a competitive environment. And we feel good about our plan, but we'll continue to do the work and be diligent about looking for opportunities where we can accelerate the growth of the firm. Sure. We feel very, very good about our team that's in place. We have a very, very deep bench. And I think we're in a great position with the leaders that are in place. One of the things I just observe broadly, and it's consistent with our performance, it's consistent with stock market values and prices, it's consistent with the environment that we're in, there is a lot of activity in the world. There's a lot of liquidity in the world. And the world is very, very competitive for great talent. We've always been a developer of strong talent, and we've always been a place where people come to look for great talent. There's nothing about any of the attrition this year that looks extraordinary when you look back over a multiyear basis. And I think we're very well positioned, but there are a lot of opportunities out there. And at times as I said in my script, people will go choose other things because they have bigger opportunities, and we welcome that. Often, they become clients when they make these moves. We rarely lose people to competitors. So, I feel good about where we sit from a talent perspective. I feel good about the interest that we're finding people have in coming to be a part of Goldman Sachs and join the journey that we're on to continue to grow the firm. Well, there's risk in markets constantly. And part of markets and economic growth is rooted to confidence. And things can go wrong -- things can go wrong at any time. And things tend to pop up in places that you don't see or you don't expect. I think, we have a very, very constructive environment, Gerard, given that the world is dominated by the pandemic and dominated by the actions that central banks and governments are taking to respond to the pandemic. The weightiness of that, the heft of that really overshadows most else that's going on. I do think over time, we'll be having discussions about the increase in government debt and government spending around the world. There will be consequence to that. That can obviously have an impact over time. There's a general view at the moment that rates are going to be low for very, very long. Certainly, given some of the actions that are taken, you could see a scenario where the perspective on that would change and could change quickly. And that would certainly create headwinds to growth and headwinds to activity. But I do think we have a very, very good backdrop at the moment with a higher probability or distribution of strong economic growth, because we had such a sharp reaction to the other side, given the pandemic. And the unwind of that I think will dominate as we move through the rest of the year into next year. And the only other comment I'd make, Brian, around the business is that there is a clear consolidation going on with the leaders because of scale, because of technology capability. And I think we're well positioned for that trend if that trend continues going forward. So, a couple of comments at a high level. I mean, there's no question that given the number of SPACs that have been raised, the incentives that are set certainly lead to all those sponsors to look for deals actively. Given our position in the M&A market, that should be a tailwind. That said, just to quantify it, when you look at our M&A activity, that M&A activity for us with SPACs last quarter, I think it was a single-digit percentage of the M&A activity that we participated in. So, while it's a tailwind, I wouldn't say that that's dominating the M&A activity and the positive constructive comments we made around M&A. In fact, that's really rooted in much more broad strategic activity that we've seen a big pickup in over the course of the last 6 to 9 months. With respect to underwriting activity, there's no question that it has slowed from the peak of where it was. I think there's a little indigestion in the context of that. You've obviously seen returns and some of the shells kind of slowed at this point. I'd also highlight just again kind of backlog, that when you look at ECM revenue last quarter, SPACs were less than 15% of our ECM revenue last quarter. So, this all creates a tailwind. But my guess is in this quarter, you'll see less new issuance than what we saw in the first quarter. And you'll see a continued progress that people try to find M&A targets to destack. All of that should be constructive for our business. Well, I think it's another form of capital formation and financing. But what I tried to highlight in my remarks, Jim, is that I think it's going to continue to evolve. I think there's room for improvement in disclosures, and you'll see us continue to push to improve disclosures. I think, you'll see different structures around incentive alignment for sponsors, and I think you'll see an evolution in that. So, like any other innovation,, they evolve, they mature. But I do think capital formation that leads to more liquidity in markets and more opportunities for investors to participate is generally a good thing. But how it's done, the disclosure around it, the incentives, the transparency, all those things are things where I think there's room for progress around this innovation. At a high level, in a high level, Jeremy, it's hard to make generalizations around these things. But I think what was unusual here was for a variety of reasons. This particular fund wound up with very concentrated positions very quickly, and I think that was unusual. And then, the actions that they chose to take, or chose not to take, obviously affected the outcome. But,, I think it was unusual with respect to the size and the concentration of positions, which changed relatively quickly. I think, we always look at every experience we have on a day-to-day basis, and we always try to learn and we always adjust. And there's no question that we spent a lot of time looking at this, even though I feel that we executed very well here. We got this one right. We don't always get everything right. So we always look at every situation to try to tweak and improve our risk management processes and how we think about these things. I do think that there -- given the visibility of this, I do think there'll be regulatory discussion around it. As I said in my prepared remarks, we'll participate constructively in those discussions. But, I think it's too early to speculate one way or another whether it will have any impact. I do think to some degree, this was a one-off event. But as I said earlier, we will see from time to time people get overly concentrated. They have too much leverage, and that leads to unwinds."

            "name": "Stephen Scherr",
            "content": "Thank you, David and good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on page 3. During the first quarter, the firm's performance reflected meaningful strength across all four of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active in raising capital, particularly in the equity markets, and we witnessed high levels of M&A activity amid elevated strategic dialogues. In global markets, we saw strength across all products and regions, as client engagement remained high. In asset management record performance was attributable to gains from our equity investments, particularly as we harvested private equity positions in an attractive market. We also saw double-digit revenue growth year-over-year in our consumer and wealth management segment for the third consecutive quarter as we further expand our wealth capabilities and scale our consumer offering. Turning to specific business performance on page 4, let me begin with investment banking. Investment banking produced record quarterly net revenues of $3.8 billion up 73% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $1.1 billion rose 43% versus last year on increased transaction closings in the quarter. During the quarter, we maintained our number one league table position as we participated in over $400 billion of announced transactions, over $100 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, and closed over 100 deals for approximately $300 billion of deal volume. The bigger headline in investment banking again this quarter was equity underwriting, where we generated a record $1.6 billion in revenues over 4 times greater than the levels the year ago. We ranked number one globally in equity underwriting with our volumes climbing to nearly $50 billion across roughly 240 deals, including over 90 initial public offerings, for companies across all markets like Coupang in Korea, InPost in Poland, and Bumble in the U.S. Our equity underwriting market share increased more than 60 basis points during the quarter, largely driven by improved share in IPOs. We experienced strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in a growing number of SPAC transactions. In debt underwriting, net revenues were $880 million, up 51% from a year ago, driven by strong activity levels, particularly in leveraged finance and asset-backed transactions. In addition, our engagement with sectors impacted by COVID, including airlines and hospitality was high. Notwithstanding the significant realization of revenue in a quarter, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at record levels, with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Revenues from corporate lending were $205 million, down 54% versus the first quarter of last year, which included significant gains on hedges maintained with respect to our relationship loan book. Revenues in the quarter reflect net interest income including from transaction banking and fees from relationships lending, partially offset by approximately $85 million of losses on hedges as spreads tightened modestly. Moving to global markets on page 5. Our franchise exhibited broad-based strength across businesses in both FICC and equities. Net revenues were $7.6 billion in the first quarter, up 47% versus a year ago, and the highest since 2010. During the quarter, we benefited from a supportive market-making environment and facilitated considerable client activity. Turning to FICC on page 6. First quarter net revenues were $3.9 billion, up 31% versus a year ago, driven by a 36% increase in intermediation where we experienced healthy client flows and demonstrated strong risk management, and grew revenues in four out of five businesses versus last year. In mortgages, revenues rose significantly, bolstered by solid results in agency mortgages and residential loans and high levels of client engagement as the business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing. In commodities, higher year-on-year performance was driven by solid inventory management across products amid volatile markets and healthy client flows. In rates, revenues rose amid strong risk management and client engagement, particularly on the back of anticipated fiscal activity in the U.S. and diverging central bank actions, during the quarter. In credit, revenues were up versus a year ago as the business benefited from continued improvement in credit spreads, while client activity remained healthy amid robust primary issuance. We also saw increasing volumes related to our automated bond pricing engine and growing activity in electronic trading. In currencies, revenues fell due to lower activity versus a strong quarter a year ago, though client engagement remained high across both the G-10 and emerging markets franchises. Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, up 68% versus a year ago, as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients and intermediated risk with discipline. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 69%, reflecting the global scale and breadth of our client franchise and aided by elevated client volumes across cash and derivatives, as well as strong risk management. In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low touch channels, and executed a number of block trades for clients during the quarter. In derivatives, we produced record results as we saw solid activity in flow and structure transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion were the best in over a decade, rising 65% year-over-year. Average balances in our prime business grew to record levels, as we supported clients amid the volatility and market events of the first quarter. As we continue to grow our prime business, we are well aware of the risks inherent in that business and the resources including liquidity that are consumed. While we avoided losses related to recent events involving Archegos Capital, as David noted, the situation underscored the potential risks of the business and the corresponding importance of our risk infrastructure and control systems. As to forward expectations for global markets, it remains difficult to predict client activity. While we do not expect the pace of activity in the first quarter to necessarily persist for the balance of the year, we believe the high levels of primary issuance, the current trajectory of economic recovery, and diverging central bank policies, particularly in emerging markets, could continue to support elevated client activity. Our confidence on the foreword of global markets rests largely on the market share gains, generated last year through a deepening of client relationships, and our ongoing investment in technology platforms to enhance client experience and drive efficiencies. As we've noted previously, this progress has improved the structural return profile of the business, independent of the wallet opportunity. Moving now to asset management on page seven. In the first quarter, we generated record revenues of $4.6 billion. Management and other fees totaled $693 million, up 8% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by fee waivers on money market funds. Incentive fees of $42 million were lower versus a strong year ago quarter. Equity investments produced $3.1 billion of net gains, including appreciation across our public investments and marks related to event-driven activity in our private equity portfolio, such as sales or capital raises. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $340 million. This quarter, we disposed of over $1.5 billion of positions, given attractive market conditions. Despite the quantum of public positions sold in the quarter, the more moderate decline in the size of our portfolio reflects the impacts of IPOs in our private portfolio and market appreciation. Across our $17 billion private equity book, we generated gains of nearly $2.6 billion from various positions, more than two thirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $225 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. We announced or closed on dispositions of private assets of $1.5 billion in the quarter, bringing the total private sales since our 2020 Investor Day to $4.7 billion. There is an implied $2.3 billion of capital associated with those assets. Additionally, we have line of sight on nearly $3 billion of incremental asset sales. Despite these actions, and as I mentioned on our January earnings call, we increased the equity attributed to asset management as a result of our 2020 CCAR stress test. This change was driven by our dynamic capital attribution methodology, which takes various regulatory constraints into consideration. On the forward, a continued reduction in balance sheet positions will produce a more meaningful impact on attributed equity reduction. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our net reduction in segment capital, consistent with what we presented at our 2020 Investor Day to below $18 billion by 2024. The ongoing harvesting of our investment portfolio is consistent with our strategy of migrating our business to third-party versus on-balance sheet investing, and attractive market valuations have accelerated some sales. We are keen to continue such activity as it would be capital accretive to the firm. That said, dispositions at attractive levels now, will diminish gains from sales in forward quarters. We are mindful of that trade-off and are working to offset the revenue impact in subsequent years as we look to realize increasing fee income from the number of alternative funds being formed and invested. Finally, in asset management, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $759 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. Let me now turn to page 8, where we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we've provided to you in prior quarters. Our equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage, and our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with loans in the segment largely secured. Moving to page 9, consumer and wealth management produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 16% versus a year ago. Management and other fees of $1.1 billion rose 12% versus last year, reflecting higher assets under supervision, which rose 25% to $637 billion. Consumer banking revenues grew to $371 million in the first quarter, up 32% versus last year, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit growth. Next, let's turn to page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision, and firm-wide management and other fees. Total AUS increase to a record $2.2 trillion during the quarter, up over $380 billion versus a year ago. The sequential increase of $59 billion was driven by $37 billion of long-term inflows and $23 billion of liquidity inflows. Our total firm-wide management and other fees grew by 11% versus the first quarter of 2020 to $1.8 billion. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.5 billion for the first quarter, higher versus year-ago, reflecting an increase in interest earning assets and lower funding costs. Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $121 billion, up $5 billion sequentially, driven by residential real estate warehouse and wealth management lending. In the first quarter, provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $70 million. This includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop and loss expectations, partially offset by portfolio growth, including approximately $180 million in provisions related to the pending acquisition of loan receivables as part of our credit card partnership with General Motors expected to launch by year-end. Next, let's turn to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $9.4 billion. While our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions fell to 34% from 41% in the first quarter of last year, compensation expense increased, reflecting strong performance. Non-compensation expenses were up only 5% versus last year, as increase in transaction-based and technology expenses was largely offset by a decline in litigation, and travel and entertainment expenses, as well as lower expenses related to our consolidated investment entities. Overall, our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 53.3%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business. We remain focused on our expense discipline in a pay for performance culture, as well as our expense initiatives where we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for further savings. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, primarily reflecting the impact of equity-based compensation of approximately $175 million. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21%. I should note that we continue to monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. Turning to our capital levels on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 40 basis points sequentially. The decline was driven by increased lending and higher market RWAs as we stepped into serve clients, partially offset by strong earnings. In the quarter, we returned a total of $3.15 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2.7 billion and approximately $450 million in common stock dividends. Our book value per share rose to a record $250.81. While the Federal Reserve has extended the limitations in place on share repurchases and dividend increases, we nonetheless expect to continue our repurchase plans in the second quarter, close to the levels of the first quarter. And we'll evaluate an increase to the dividend as permitted. Turning to the balance sheet, total assets ended the quarter at $1.3 trillion, 12% higher versus last quarter as we supported client activity. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets, averaging nearly $300 billion. On the liability side, our total deposits rose to $286 billion up $26 billion versus last quarter. Notably consumer deposits surpassed $100 billion during the quarter.  Our long-term debt rose by $6 billion, driven by $20 billion of benchmark issuance, given the growth in our balance sheet outside of bank entities, particularly due to accretive deployment opportunities in our prime business, we now expect benchmark issuances to be modestly higher than maturities and redemptions this year. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We remain confident that execution of our strategic priorities will continue to drive a better client experience, more durable revenues, and strong returns for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Sure, Glenn. Thanks for the question. So, let me just go through the numbers, so we're all level set. In the quarter, we closed on about $1.5 billion of balance sheet reduction producing about $852 million of AE relief. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, since our Investor Day, we've disposed of balance sheet positions totaling $4.7 billion that produced about $2.3 billion of relief as well. In terms of line of sight, as I said, we have a view into about $3 billion of balance sheet reduction. My view is that the capital attachment associated with that $3 billion would be, I would say, well in excess of about $1 billion, probably close to $1.4 billion in terms of AE relief there. As to the profile vintage and otherwise, I think it's important to recognize that in pursuing the strategy of migrating to more third-party funds, we're going to look across the portfolio, regardless of vintage of opportunities, particularly in this market, to advance. It's not only in the pursuit of course of that strategy, but equally it reduces the capital density of that business and holds the promise of reduced capital that the firm would be required to hold overall, and so two components in the context of what we're trying to achieve strategically. If you look at what we've done, just on the last part of your question in terms of fundraising, you'll remember that through 2020, we noted that we had raised funds approximating $40 billion. Taking that and extending it through the first quarter, we're up just north of about $52 billion and are looking to deploy that now where obviously management fees get paid on deployment and investment of that fundraising. And so, the roster of ambition of what we're going to do this year is quite real. We're confident in our ability to achieve it. And this is all obviously part and parcel of meeting what I was talking about, which is as we see the harvest of positions now and take that revenue in, we will see compensation for that, if you will, in the context of management fees as we grow and deploy capital in the alternative space. Well, if you look at our overall backlog, which as I noted is at record levels, I would say that notwithstanding very high level of revenue recognition certainly in the investment banking segment, we're nonetheless seeing the backlog replenishment at extraordinarily high levels. And so, that's really the sort of best picture forward, if you will, in terms of what our clients are engaged in doing. I think, on the forward, as it relates, for example, to global markets, there it's difficult to say. As I noted in the comment and David did as well, it's hard to know what the market opportunity will be. The comparative set of results, second and third quarter last year versus this will be challenging just given the volatility we saw last year in those quarters. I think, the confidence we're taking in terms of sustainability of results lies in our market share, and we have picked up market share across global markets, across investment banking both in financial advisory and equity capital markets, and we will rely on that to capture kind of our fair share or better of the opportunity set presented. So, Christian, just to pivot off of David's comments, all of which I'll give to you and our -- a reflection or a product of the client centricity that David was speaking to. First of all, across the equities business in global markets, I think we're seeing a very clear consolidation of share in and among a discrete number of banks in the U.S., among which we are one. We saw elevated prime levels, part of the strategy that we've been pursuing, and as I noted in my comments, record prime levels that contributed to meaningful uptick in equity financing. Even on the last call, I had noted that over the course of 2020 across global markets, we had picked up about 120 basis points of wallet share across the patch. And then when you look at -- I'll just take 2 individual businesses in FICC, just to pivot to FICC for a moment. First of all if you look at mortgages, the interesting thing about mortgages is that this business is now sort of pivoted away from sort of straight market-making and is now itself engaged in financing and loan origination. And so doing more for more clients has been kind of the signature, if you will, of just expanding in the mortgage space that has grown that business. And then, if you look at credit, we have picked up meaningful market share, both in cash and loans, in the context of what we're doing. And then the last thing I would say, which I think is a contributor to enhanced share, client engagement and the like has been what we've done in the development of platforms. And credit is a good example of that, where portfolio trading has grown quite considerably. Our place in it is quite high. And so, again it's all, as David is saying, client centricity and engagement with clients and meeting clients where they care to execute platforms being a good example. Sure. So the way I would think about expenses is the following. First of all in non-comp expense more broadly, there should be no doubt that we have a very keen focus on controlling our expense base. I'm saying that independent of the efficiencies that we laid out at Investor Day, which I'll come on to. But our as reported, non-comp expense was up 5%; ex litigation, up 9%. And within that, literally the totality of the increase in expenses were related to transaction-based expenses, so BC&E relating to elevated levels in global markets and our technology spend. And so, I think on the forward, you should expect that where transaction activity is high, where we're meeting our clients, where market opportunity is large, that variable expense will continue to fluctuate, consistent with the market and will carry us there. The second piece I'll comment on is just the $1.3 billion of expense initiative. Again, independent of the day-to-day focus on non-comp expense. And there we continue to make progress in all of the areas that we had talked about, including our real estate footprint as we just announced that we're opening up offices in Birmingham. We did that as it relates to Hyderabad. All of that is a component piece of what we're trying to achieve in the $1.3 billion of expenses. The last piece I'd say is the operating leverage that exists with compensation. As we've said many, many times, we pay for performance. And so, that lever is always available to us as and to the extent we see revenue turn down relative to the kind of performance we've otherwise seen in this quarter. Sure. So, first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco is 6% at the bank. We stand higher than both of the minimums and don't find that to be a binding constraint to us. And so, I would say that at both levels, we have ample growth capacity in terms of balance sheet growth before that comes on to the horizon as being an issue for us. So SLR, not the issue that it is for some of the other commercial banks. In terms of RWA growth, I think that you'll see that commensurate with the nature and level of activity that's there. The one thing I do want to point out is that risk control and risk calibration remains unchanged. It is as disciplined as you would expect it to be, notwithstanding RWA growth. So, the opportunity set that's been presented causes us to extend balance sheet and grow risk-weighted assets commensurate with that opportunity, but without compromise to the kind of risk levels that we find. I mean, the thing I would say, Steve, on this is that if you look at growth in the firm and you look at growth in balance sheet, in the service of our clients as David's been talking about, the resource input to this has been maintained so as to protect the risk flank of the firm. We're sitting with elevated levels of liquidity at GCLA north of $300 billion. We sit in an ample capital position, obviously elevated by where the minimums sit, but within -- in an offensive mode and a buffer prepared to deal and engage with our clients. Marry those two resource sort of points alongside risk controls that David spoke about, and we feel quite comfortable with the RWA growth we're experiencing and keeping it in control and checked from a risk point of view. Yes. So, on the money market comment, it was approximately $100 million in fee waivers. And bear in mind, very common practice, as you know, throughout the industry. So, nothing unusual about that. On the alternatives space, the management fees that we'll take in are on deployment of the investable capital that's already beginning. And so, you'll continue to see that. I did note that on one of the charts that we show, which looks at firm-wide assets under supervision and firm-wide management and other fees, it's a slide where my ambition is to disclose more. Particularly as these alternative funds become deployed, we can start to share more with you about how much of that management fee across the whole of the business, never mind the segment in which it sits, but across the whole of the firm, is being generated by this strategic pivot. Yes. I would say that I'd have to go back and look at where the sort of prior record was set, but it's certainly at a record. I'll give you a little bit of composition in it, which is that it's cutting across a range of businesses. We're seeing higher-than-normal replenishment and backlog build in EMEA and in Asia than we are in the Americas. But bear in mind, overall size of the business in the Americas is quite significant. So, notional dollars would be higher there, but it's showing some geographic composition. To my memory, I wouldn't view it as a multiple to prior peak. I would call it as probably 10% higher than where the top of that number had been historically. Yes. So I don't want to peg the exact sort of aspiration of where we'll be, and our ambition is to take the dividend up when the rules permit. But I would say that our ambition is to put the dividend in a more competitive standing than perhaps where it has sat historically. By the way, we've already been on that path, having raised the dividend quite considerably since David and John and I all took our seats. And so, to my memory, we took it up about 47% or thereabout at the beginning of our tenure, and higher since. I think, the ambition here is to have the dividend grow commensurate with an increasing durability of revenues in the business. As the more durable businesses or revenue streams and businesses grow, the dividend ought to reflect that, and it will. And so, that's probably the best sort of forward view on dividend thinking that I can provide. So, we don't break down the backlog exactly that way, but let me just provide as much color as I can on this. First of all in the middle market, that continues to grow. And the revenue that we've taken in, in investment banking around the growth in the client set has been quite substantial, and frankly I think beyond that which we otherwise thought we would achieve at the Investor Day. On the corporate side, you can see it play out in the context of investment banking revenues broadly. I would say equally, we're playing to a larger corporate set in our global market segment in terms of those becoming more prolific clients in what we do. And then, on the geography, as I mentioned before, we have seen kind of double-digit growth in backlog in EMEA and in Asia. And we continue to see growth in the Americas as well. But again, the Americas presents a much larger set more broadly. I'd also refer you back to a comment David made and we've spoken about before, which is our ambition and our focus around client centricity in global markets. It's always been there as it relates to investment banking, has put us in among the top 3 among 64 of the most prolific clients, top 100 clients in global markets, and that's up from 51 the year before. And so, we continue to see growth in the share we're taking. By the way, this is all against the backdrop of consolidation in share, I would say, among U.S. banks relative to the European competitors across a range of product areas in equities and in FICC. I mean, I think it's too early to judge whether there'll be a significant shift. I suspect that there'll be certain clients that look to migrate from where they were to a different firm, but it's too early to judge that. I think, the important thing to note is that growth in prime has been a strategic imperative for us. It's not the by-product of the Archegos incident or the like. And as we grow that, and this is what David was referring to, we continue to maintain quite a vigilant posture as it relates to risk that's embedded in it. We recognize risk of concentration. We recognize the consumptive nature of that business. And so, we're going to maintain kind of our threshold of risk tolerance in terms of clients that we bring on. Whether or not it shows consolidation in prime, pricing pressure in prime, I suspect it might, but it's just too early to judge that just yet. Well, the one that I would call out is credit in FICC just as an example, and I mentioned it earlier. So, this is where we saw a trend line developing around portfolio trading. And so, investments that we were making in platforms and technology capabilities and the like have served us well in the capture of a solid percentage of the portfolio trading and the volumes that are going through there. And so, that's an example of advancing and enhancing our technology capabilities that are in place. I'd also point out more generally that over the last couple of years, we've been spending quite a bit of money on straight-through processing. That is, taking note of the demands among our clients around middle and back office and the overall experience of our clients set not just on the front end of the trade, but all through to the back. Each of those investments, whether it's technology to build platforms that captures portfolio trading credit, or development of enhanced technology to automate and streamline the overall straight-through processing, all of that is subject to an ROI framework with an eye toward improving the overall client and user experience that's there. And so, that's just a little bit of insight into how we think about the investment and where we've been making that investment. Well, I'm not sure I have it at my hand kind of the number of systems and the like. But let me answer the question this way, and let me use transaction banking as being a really good example, okay? Transaction banking is a new platform designed from the front end all the way through to the back, into the books and records of the firm. It is cloud-based engineering, which has all the efficiencies that I'm sure you're aware of in terms of a lower expense to sort of keep it current in terms of developments around engineering and the like. And so, our new builds are largely, perhaps not exclusively, but largely cloud-based. We're always looking to rationalize platforms. And I would say one thing I've learned from Marco Argenti and George in engineering is that it's as important to decommission old platforms as it is to put new ones in. We're riveted and focused on doing that so as to eliminate legacy technology, build in the cloud. And I think some of the newer businesses that we're involved in, transaction banking consumer, benefit from the absence of legacy, so that we can build new and efficiently and in the right form. So Brennan, first of all, thanks for the feedback. I mean, it's a big area of focus for us. The strategy has clearly been to develop out businesses that exhibit greater durability to the revenue stream. And there's no question that disclosure will follow, in the context of providing all of you with greater insight into where we think or where we would define recurring and durability of earnings that are there. On the specific points you raised around consumer, I think as consumer grows, and so David was reflecting before that that business is now turning a corner to sort of resemble the ambition of a broader platform than it is a series of products. We'd like to find ourselves in a place where we will and can provide greater disclosure on consumer, just as an example. I would say, the same will be true as transaction banking becomes more durable. These are areas where as they become more material, and we expect that they will, disclosure will naturally follow. And then, I think your feedback is a good one, just in the context of providing a firm-wide perspective through disclosure on durability. Well, I think the way to think about it is that share repurchase is going to follow kind of a longstanding philosophy where we look at opportunities across the firm to deploy capital and where those returns are attractive as they have been this past quarter, we'll continue to do that. Where we don't, we will look to return capital back in the form of share repurchase, with the dividend obviously being a reflection, as I commented earlier, of greater confidence and a more durable set of revenues and that net dividend increase to reflect it. On the achievement of the 13% to 13.5%, I would say that the lever is honestly less about share repurchase and more about what we're doing to alter the capital consumptive density of the firm. So, key among those initiatives sits in asset management, where the pivot from on-balance sheet to third-party fund is as much about creating a durable, more predictable revenue stream as it is lowering the capital density of that business, and therefore of the firm. And to the extent that happens, we will be doing ourselves the favor of reducing capital intensity. But my expectation is that the Fed will recognize it equally and subsequent CCAR exams will reflect it as lowering of the requirement that we ultimately will have. And it's on top of that that we'll maintain what I view, we view, as an offensive buffer to deploy capital for clients. So, less about share repurchase, more about fundamental shifts in change that we're bringing to the business, both to help ourselves and frankly speaking, to enable the Fed to come to a realization of the lower capital consumption profile of the business. Well, kind of hard to put precision around that. I would simply say that we have made it, as I've said, a strategic priority to grow prime balances. I would say that our business has skewed historically more to the long short, and less so competitively relative to the comp -- to the quants. But our ambition is to continue to grow it. But as I said before, that growth is not going to happen absent corresponding risk insight into how that book grows. We're very, very aware of the embedded risk in it. We're very aware of the liquidity consumption in that book. And so, we mind ourselves as we grow volumes in that. But it's been part and parcel again to the theme of durability around financing that goes on in and around that business. And so, the balances have grown consistent with that. Well, I would say -- I mean, listen. It depends a lot on the collateral pool that you have. Let me describe it this way. It's hard for us to know what goes on in every other bank around the street. I can only speak to what we know and watch inside of Goldman Sachs. And so, what David was describing, particularly around Archegos, the story is less about the events of Archegos as much as how we're set up to monitor it. And so, we look at consolidated or overly consolidated concentrated positions in individual accounts. We look for excessive position concentration across the whole of our business. We look and undertake a daily mark-to-market on collateral and corresponding margin. And in tracking concentration and correlation, we adjust what it is that we're doing, the level of margin we take, the clients we take in, the pricing we put against that prime. Those are all the important inputs in terms of how we grow that business broadly. Well, since there are no more questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call. On behalf of our senior management team, we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months. If additional questions arise in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to Carey and the IR team. Otherwise, please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Thank you."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, January 17, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategic Officer at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information and forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I will begin with a review of our financial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter. FICC and equity activities - activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients and our equity investment portfolio saw continued headwinds. We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the year, quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter. We always strive to maintain a pay-for-performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower. That said we also recognize that we operate in a talent-driven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our world class franchise. On our earnings call last July, we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our non-compensation costs. We have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources, especially in light of the worse-than-expected backdrop in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced the size of our balance sheet, further optimized and reduced our RWA footprint and managed down our G-SIB score to hit our 3% target. We have also started firm-wide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and right-size the firm for the current environment. We made the difficult decision to conduct a 6% headcount reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we had paused our regular performance management-related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in headcount given the opportunity set in 2021. We feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions. They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals and we wish them the best. Additionally, we are taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create shareholder value. For instance, this quarter, we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey. We also narrowed our ambitions on our consumer strategy and made some key decisions. We started a process to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform. We will likely allow the book to roll down naturally, although we are considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product. At the right time in the future, we intend to offer checking to our wealth management clients. For now, our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky. Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses. We are very focused on developing a path toward profitability and platform solutions and we will provide more detail at our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us \u2013 for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inflation, but some we never thought we would see like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren\u2019t many signs of widespread distress, balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy, but it\u2019s clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., central bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy. And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near-term. They are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer term plans. Many firms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control. Taking a step back, I am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. We generated double-digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove significant market disruption with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. We reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. We also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our first Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor. That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for. As we go forward, we are executing on three key priorities we have laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees in our asset and wealth management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities and our global banking and markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver profitability. We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have the people in place around the world to serve our clients\u2019 broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. We look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I will now turn it over to Denis.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let\u2019s start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $11.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today. Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking and Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year, down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year. The exceptional performance of our Global Banking and Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for firm-wide performance. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year driven by a significant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty. Advisory revenues, however, were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A as we have for 23 of the last 24 years and we ranked second in equity and equity-related underwriting. We also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from number three last year. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity, but remain solid, particularly in advisory. That being said, clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity. While we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly, we are seeing some positive signs of activity, particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 44% year-on-year. In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC financing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-on-year. The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year. Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter. Across FICC and Equities, financing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client financing activities. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million. Moving on to Page 6. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products. Let\u2019s now turn to Page 7 where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year. Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I will turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions. We expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach profitability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-offs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. We anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. We expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our 60% efficiency ratio target as the right place to run the firm. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents a 130 basis point buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter, we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run significantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the firm. We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. So given the capital RWA and expense actions that you have already taken, if 2023 is a little bit better in banking, but it\u2019s kind of the same atmosphere we\u2019ve been in because it feels like it\u2019s lingering. Can you all get closer to your return targets this year? I know it\u2019s very difficult in this backdrop but what I am getting at is do we need investment banking to be a lot better to get there or have the actions you\u2019ve taken start closing the gap? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: So, thanks, Glenn and I appreciate the question. Obviously, an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. We talk about our targets in a normalized environment. One thing I just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management. This certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet and asset management. And we have made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very significant asset management balance sheet larger than we would like to have. We reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward. But given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it\u2019s not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. And if you look at the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter, it earned zero, even with some businesses in there that are highly profitable, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal. I don\u2019t think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way. And so I think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. I\u2019d highlight last year, we way outperformed the peer average ROE by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed, and we\u2019re just more sensitive to that.\nDenis Coleman: I mean things I might add, Glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the [forward] (ph) I think the reason why we\u2019re taking action with respect to our headcount footprint and some of our non-compensation expenses is to drive efficiency even further. And as you point out, with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re in a pretty flexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe staying up to 50,000, transaction banking is good, but it\u2019s unfortunately a small revenue base. Consumer maybe music to some investors ears is being deemphasized. So I guess my question is, whereas your goal is to build a more durable firm and I share that goal, where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being deemphasized from the past strategy? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think, Glenn, the big thing in that, and it\u2019s always been a big part of it is the shift from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. Our organic growth across our asset management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry. We continue to grow our management fees in the asset management business. We\u2019re continuing to grow our wealth business. Our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. And so it\u2019s that mix change, less balance sheet intensity, growth in asset and wealth management, continued financing growth in our core Global Banking and Markets business, which you\u2019ve seen and continue to grow and then getting these platforms that we have to operate profitably, which we believe we can do. We believe they are good businesses at scale, but they are in a different stage of the development. Those things should make the business more resilient, and that\u2019s not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out 3 years ago, and we will amplify again next month at Investor Day. What I think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets heavy and balance sheet intense business had, of course, with a drag from some of the investments we\u2019re making in other things.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning and thank you. I guess maybe, David, just sticking to that, as you make the asset management business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption, how do we think about the ROTE target you put out last year? Is that still achievable within the 3-year time frame that you had laid out or does that get pushed out given the work that needs to be done and, in a world, where consumer is being deemphasized?\nDavid Solomon: I think, candidly, that it depends on the environment. An environment with massive swing in asset prices continues, we will push it out. If that simply normalizes then the overall economic picture of the firm, in addition to the work we\u2019re doing on the expense side that we\u2019ve gotten focused on, will show a very, very different picture. I\u2019m not going to guess on how that will play out. But again, I\u2019d amplify that I don\u2019t think what we saw in 2022 was normal. And certainly, if you go back and look at 15 years of history, it wasn\u2019t.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Okay. And I guess just as a follow-up in terms of growth in asset management, wealth management, significant asset price dislocations. Does that create some M&A opportunities when you think about inorganic growth in those businesses? Or for the time being is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic?\nDavid Solomon: I think at the moment, we\u2019re extremely focused on in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform and moving forward from here, I do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in asset and wealth management. But certainly, this year, we\u2019re focused on the execution. We made an acquisition in asset management last year. We want to integrate NNIP. We want to move forward with that. So I think this year, we will be focused on execution.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So David and Denis, I wanted to start off with a question just on the provision outlook. Admittedly, the loan loss provision came in higher than we had anticipated. And I was hoping you could just speak to, how much of it was growth math related versus deterioration in the macro? And given some of the planned actions you\u2019re going to take for that business, how should we think about like a normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we should expect going forward?\nDenis Coleman: Good morning, thank you for that So let me help with some color as it relates to provisions, particularly in the fourth quarter. So order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was about 50%. Net charge-offs about 25%, and the balance attributable to our scenario. I think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter, and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of 2023 is that we began the on-balance sheet originations in our point-of-sale lending platform, GreenSky. And so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. So that\u2019s something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year.\nSteven Chubak: Got it. And maybe just for a follow-up on capital. As it relates to the discussion tied to Glenn\u2019s question, I was hoping you could speak to how you\u2019re scenario planning for Basel IV, Basel III end game. I recognize we don\u2019t have a proposal yet, but certainly, it has significant implications for future returns you can generate. You\u2019re running with a healthy level of cushion at the moment. But just wanted to understand how you see it impacting your various businesses? What planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Fair question on everybody\u2019s mind. As you note, we don\u2019t yet have the details. But we give it a lot of thought. We\u2019ve taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that we will be in a position to respond quickly to that. We do have a long-standing track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. You can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our financial resources that we were able to maneuver them very, very quickly to build capital and change our RWA footprint, given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. So we\u2019re standing by for more detail on the rule, but confident that when we get it, we will be able to manage accordingly.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning, Betsy.\nDenis Coleman: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Two questions. One follow-up on the consumer business, I heard you on the markets pull back, you\u2019re going to see originating there. Does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration and the partner card GreenSky, those pieces that you are keeping or is this market pullback going to feed either capital increase or the ability to lean in other business lines like the ISG business?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Betsy, it\u2019s Denis. I\u2019ll start with that. So as we indicated, we\u2019re going to cease the originations in under Marcus lending. And then furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll off or we may pursue other alternatives. That should free up a bunch of financial resources. We\u2019re continued within the overall asset and wealth management segment where the deposit business is resident within the private banking and lending line. That remains a strategic priority for the firm, and we\u2019ve experienced very good growth there. That business is achieving more and more scale. So that will remain an ongoing focus. I think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending, we will continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. And within the Platform Solutions business, we\u2019re now down to three different businesses: transaction banking, the cards platform and our point-of-sale lending business, GreenSky. And our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to profitability.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter. I know you had the action of the headcount reduction. Is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out because, obviously, it\u2019s not ongoing? Or does that hit 1Q? Maybe you could speak to how we should think about that? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I have one. Dave, I think it\u2019s your birthday today, right? You announced that a few years ago.\nDavid Solomon: It is my birthday, and I couldn\u2019t be happier to be on this call with you. But thank you. Thank you for that.\nMike Mayo: Well, since it\u2019s your birthday, do you want the positive question or the negative question first.\nDavid Solomon: You want \u2013 I\u2019m happy to take any question. Any question that you have, Mike. You know that. We\u2019re happy to take questions both positive and tough. I mean it wasn\u2019t a great quarter. So I don\u2019t expect all the questions to be easy.\nMike Mayo: Well, I mean, it is concerning in terms of the reorg, I mean we will get more at the Investor Day. And just a comment, I hope you give us more data. Here we have three new sectors, and you only gave us the prior four quarters and the prior 2 years without much detail. So I hope you give us more ahead. But the question is, you present the firm differently, but will the firm actually be run differently other than the more narrow focus on consumer?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. And so I appreciate that. And to \u2013 two comments. First, just on the transparency and information comment, I think this management team, Mike, over the last 4.5 years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of Goldman Sachs, and we remain focused on that. If you have certain feedback on things you\u2019d like to see, etcetera, we really welcome that, and Carey will reach out to you, and we will take that feedback. But we\u2019re focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we\u2019re doing. Second, on the evolution and the move to this, what I\u2019d say, and this has been something that\u2019s been a journey that we started a number of years ago, but the firm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally. And that candidly is a difference than the way Goldman Sachs has been during my tenure at the firm. In terms of our core business of banking and markets, there are synergies that we\u2019ve been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. I highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our Investor Day. It\u2019s long forgotten. But when we did our Investor Day, back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the ROE of the markets business above 10%. That was a big question on the minds of investors. And we look now at our combined banking and markets business, this business, we think, is a leader. It outperforms in terms of its market share and outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser-focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business. We also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our financing business there, and we\u2019re very, very focused on that. In asset and wealth management, we\u2019ve worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business. And as we\u2019ve said over the last few years, reduce the balance sheet intensity of that. And we\u2019re on a journey. Would I like it to be further along? Yes. If it was further along, there would have been less volatility, particularly in the context of this year in the fourth quarter. But we continue \u2013 that\u2019s something we laid out 3 years ago, and we continue to move at that. The change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in consumer business, I think, is a change. We continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes. We think our partnership with Apple will provide meaningful dividends for the firm over time. We think GreenSky is a good business that can be accretive, but the platforms are in a different stage of development than our other businesses. They are small in the overall scale of Goldman Sachs, but we think there are benefits to that for the firm. We will communicate more as we move forward around that, but we\u2019re making progress and we will continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive profitability. So that\u2019s a high-level response. I don\u2019t know if there is something else you want me to drill into, but that\u2019s a high-level response.\nMike Mayo: Yes, the follow-up is more specific. I mean, look, you said it\u2019s a disappointing quarter. Your returns are well below where you want them to be, and variable revenues and variable costs, not so much your efficiency ratios go the other direction. So I mean, I think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the benefits of what you might get on the expense side, okay, you\u2019re scaling back consumer as I asked you last quarter, you said you were losing money so maybe you lose less money. The headcount reduction should allow you to save money. So can you ballpark the benefits to expenses from the moves in consumer and the headcount reductions? And along those lines now that you\u2019ve moved capital well above the regulatory and your own firm\u2019s target buyback so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for 2023?\nDenis Coleman: Sure, Mike, let me take that. So unpacking a couple components. So we exercised a headcount reduction earlier this year, approximately 3,200 employees left the firm. The run rate expense associated with that group was approximately $475 million, and we expect the benefit in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. Beyond that, we have a series of non-compensation expense initiatives. We\u2019re setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efficient levels of non-compensation spend. The narrowing of the focus in consumer is important. There are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the offering and capabilities of that. The focus is now narrow. And then finally, as you identify, we have more flexibility with respect to capital deployment, which we intend to take advantage of.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up on some of those questions for Mike. And just really be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter, just given how elevated the expenses were. So I guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inflexibility, revenues down 20% for the full year. And I understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was \u2013 it was a remarkable year. Some of it even identified or segregated as special and therefore, shouldn\u2019t be expected to repeat. So the \u2013 was the discipline fully there? Are you doing enough on comp? You have reiterated the focus on efficiency, but the results here in \u2013 I get it, nobody is buying Goldman today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year.\nDenis Coleman: So Brennan, a couple of questions. As for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that\u2019s the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. So that\u2019s what explains the time frame in which the expenses going to be booked. As it relates to compensation expense, variable expense flexibility in the fourth quarter, I guess I would point out a couple of things. One, the overall comp and benefit expense were down 15%. We had grown headcount by 10% additionally. And when you \u2013 that\u2019s over $2.5 billion of less compensation and benefit expense, so it\u2019s a meaningful number. And if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money are impacted by inflation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our firm on behalf of our clients. And we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. But ultimately, it\u2019s a balance. And we have excellent people. We depend on them to deliver for clients. The market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we\u2019re in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. Certainly, we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that we are positioned to capture that.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Alright. Thanks for that color, Denis. I appreciate that. This one might end up being moved, but I just don\u2019t want to confirm it. I have spend some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of J-curve expectation and whatnot, but it seems as though exiting Marcus and the tone down. Should we not even be thinking about a J-curve for the consumer business? Is that not a consideration here any longer because it does seem as though the cross through from the breakeven even ex-provision has been a lot longer than expected. So, should we just forget about that chart given the pivot, or does that still remain part of the consideration?\nDenis Coleman: So, a couple of things I would point out. As people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the Platform Solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. So, we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate, and we expect to drive a lot of benefit at scale. But as we have discussed and you will observe, we also continue to build our provisions as we scale some of those activities. And so our focus remains singularly on driving towards profitability of this segment, but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate profitability. And we do look forward to trying to help people understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning David and Denis and happy birthday, David.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you.\nDevin Ryan: I guess just first one to zero in on transaction banking here in platforms. $325 million for transaction banking and other in 2022 is up 50% year-over-year. So, you guys have really had great growth from scratch just a couple of years ago, but still obviously immaterial. So, I just want to talk a little bit about how you feel like progress is going in that part of the business. Can this get to a multi-billion dollar business just doing kind of what it\u2019s already doing? I know you just launched in Europe there, really just trying to think about kind of the execution roadmap for that part of the business.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks for that question. Now, we are very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business, and it\u2019s a business that has particular benefits as we scale activities on it. We have our tech platform up and running. We continue to grow our clients on the platform. They unanimously continued to give us the feedback that it is a very differentiated and attractive platform to be part of. And we have taken that business, as you say, from its inception to larger scale. We think there is a lot of potential for that business on the forward. And we are very focused at this point in time in continuing to drive deposit balances, continue to drive our customer count, further penetrate, as you mentioned, our international expansion continues. We have opened in our fifth country. We now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world. There are true benefits to the network effect of a business like this with global reach. And we continue to see very, very good opportunities for this business.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. Thanks. A follow-up here just on the market\u2019s financing opportunity. So, that\u2019s already obviously been a nice part of the story for Goldman. What do you need to do to grow financing further? Is it just a lot of the same kind of blocking and tackling, or are there specific things you could point to that could drive kind of another step function there? And then just kind of more near-term, you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and declining through the quarter. Has that changed at all just to start this year with risk appetite to maybe a bit better today than through most of the fourth quarter?\nDenis Coleman: Yes. A couple of comments I would make. So, I think as it relates to the FICC financing, we have a very good opportunity set in front of us. The progress that we have made with the client franchise and our market shares and given the overall backdrop and the availability of financing in the world right now, our clients continue to come to us. And given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel incremental financing activities in the FICC business. On the equity side of the equation, obviously, asset markets moved around quite severely, particularly in the end of the year, which drives prime brokerage balances. But as you know, we are also working very hard to reduce our financial resource footprint, particularly our G-SIB level. That brought with it significant RWA reductions. And it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth, certainly in the fourth quarter. I think as we turn the page on a New Year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity financing activities, and we have less constraints given that we have now achieved the 3% G-SIB target.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to expand upon the new Slide 7. And as you look at the different buckets and asset classes, how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fund raises and closings? And I was hoping you could maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for subsequent funds, meaning the size increase that you have typically seen for second or third funds from the previous one to give us a sense of the momentum you are seeing in that business?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, we always have a very, very broad portfolio of funds. And we have been in this investing business for a number of decades, and it\u2019s one of the contributors to our position as the number five largest active asset management firm in the world. And across the portfolio of different funds, we have some extremely mature businesses. Our GS Capital Partners, equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds. We have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. And we continued to diversify and expand our offering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand. So, as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global, broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many different types of investors, many of which are very, very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer.\nDan Fannon: Okay. And then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the FICC and trading backdrop. It sounds like you are through kind of the optimization of RWAs, but maybe can you talk about where you see on the broader intermediation side, the backdrop, maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share opportunities into the rest of the year?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, we continue to focus on market share. Market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year, it shows that we continued to grow market share in those businesses, sales and trading. So, that remains a very, very core focus of the firm. We continue to make progress, and we think we can make incremental progress. One of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of different business lines, which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. The last year, given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world, were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business, the commodities business. Meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities. Certainly, if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications on the investment-grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there is a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new offerings that we should be able to capture, given the investment that we have made in the client franchise. So, I can\u2019t predict exactly where activity will come from 2023. Certainly, some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022. But it\u2019s quite possible that certain activities that were softer in \u201822 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. You mentioned continued interest in asset and wealth management deals, kind of over time. It sounds more like bolt-on, but I guess just are you more open-minded towards maybe a transformational deal as we think out, not necessarily this year, but just in the next couple of years. I mean to-date, you have \u2013 what I would characterize, I think most people had characterized, you have piece-mailed some deals. You have done some organic expansion and mixed results in different areas. But just thoughts on maybe more openness to something transformational down the road.\nDavid Solomon: I think we have been asked this question. I appreciate the question. We have been asked it a bunch over time. I think in certain businesses like asset and wealth management, there are significant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform. We have the fifth largest active asset manager in the world now that we have stood up all the businesses inside Goldman Sachs. And so that scale is real. And there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale. And certainly, there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more significant. I would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. There are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it. Certainly, over the last 5 years, the prices have been eye-popping, maybe we are in a different environment where well, that will normalize. But we are always open to things that we think can strengthen Goldman Sachs, but also as somebody that\u2019s been an M&A banker for a significant part of my career, I know the barter do that, the cultural issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very, very high. So, I would say we are always open. But at the moment, our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us, and we think we can drive good returns, good book value growth, good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That was clear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. David, in your opening comments, you gave us your three priorities of growing management fees in the Asset & Wealth Management business, maximizing the wallet share and growing financing activities in global banking and markets and then scaling the platform. In your \u2013 in the number two, maximizing the wallet share, can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share, both in investment banking and markets? And how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So, we \u2013 you can take a look at our performance in these businesses. And you can see that the performance is quite strong. A couple of things I will point to even in this quarter\u2019s performance. You can look at our relative M&A revenue performance. You can look at our relative FICC performance and even our equities performance in what\u2019s been a tough quarter, the relatives look pretty good. We set out 3 years ago, and this was a big structural change. We had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business. We had always thought about them in our investment banking business. And we really \u2013 we brought that ethos into the markets business. And I know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how 3 years ago, we set out to say there are 100 clients that contribute meaningfully to our FICC and equities businesses. And we are top three with only 44 of them. We are now top three with 77 of those top 100. And now we have shifted the focus to really look at okay, top three, but why aren\u2019t we wanted to, what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with, and we think there is more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing and ticking equities on that number one and number two position. In banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. That footprint grows candidly has been a little bit expensive when there has been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity, but we think that will serve us well if you take a 3-year or a 5-year view looking forward. So, again, there is a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we are investing in. The core of the firm is very strong. Those wallet shares are strong, but we still see more opportunity and we are laser-focused on continuing to execute on it. And I don\u2019t think there is any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business, so we will continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy in the consumer business, you have been very clear, obviously, on how you are positioning this going forward. I may have missed this, so I apologize. But what went wrong? When you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses 3 years ago or so, I know Marcus deposits has been around longer than that. But when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out, what went wrong?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think there are a bunch of things that went right, and there were some things that did not go well. I think we executed well on some things that we didn\u2019t execute on others. But the simple thing that I would phrase, Gerard, and I think it\u2019s a fair question, is we tried to do too much too quickly. And of course, in the environment that we are in, it\u2019s hard to go back when we started in that strategy 6 years ago. We obviously built the deposit business, the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. And I think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes. One of the big changes that affect the pace of the ability to do this and it\u2019s different in scaling things like this is CECL is a big change. CECL changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch. So, we have had to adjust to that. The regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years. But I think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, was affecting our execution. I think we probably, in some places, haven\u2019t had all the talent that we have needed to execute the way we have wanted. We are making adjustments on that, but by narrowing down the three core things that we are going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the firm. I think we have got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward. And so that\u2019s what we are doing. And I \u2013 the takeaway I would like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things and we pivot. We are not married to things. We are willing to change. I think when I go back to our 2020 Investor Day, and I look at what we laid out during that period of time, we have accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things we have laid out. That doesn\u2019t mean there is not more work to do. But you know what, we didn\u2019t execute perfectly on some. So, we have taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments. And that\u2019s kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of Goldman Sachs that I want to amplify. We are always willing to make changes. We are always going to be focused on shareholders. And even though everything has not gone perfectly, again, I would point to our 40% book value growth since our Investor Day, and I map that out. Our book value per share growth, I believe it\u2019s more than double the next nearest competitor. And so we are going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long-term. I think we are good at nimbly making adjustments, and we will always be very clear to have when we get things right or we get things wrong.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for investment banking, I appreciate Denis\u2019 comments, we have seen a big increase in debt issuance, so some improving liquidity in the debt markets at least. Is that, in your mind, a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs? And just generally, how are you thinking about the outlook for investment banking? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Sure. I think that \u2013 I think one of the things we are dealing with and it\u2019s over-amplified in our very capital market-centric business is that 2021 was not normal. The second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. They were way inflated by the massive fiscal stimulus that created kind of, I would call, on the spectrum of activity, excess activity, pulled a lot of activity forward. And then because of market disruption, we have tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. It\u2019s the first year in over 50 years that both fixed income and equity markets were down. We had the S&P down 20%, the NASDAQ down 30%. You had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. And when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. My historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four quarters to six quarters. And so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly, for the next couple of quarters, they are still thinking about $100. But if it\u2019s at $70 for four quarters or five quarters, six quarters, then it\u2019s $70. And suddenly, when you look ahead and you think about either an M&A transaction or financing, you have more realism about the reset of values. So, I think we are well into that journey of a reset and expectations. I think it might have another quarter or two quarters to further reset, but I think we are starting to see some additional improvements, people point to the investment-grade debt market. That would obviously be where it would come first. But my expectations would be in the back half of \u201823 meaningfully better. And also, it\u2019s interesting, and I will be heading to Dallas tonight with others, but I was watching some of the commentary, the macro commentary. People are softening their view of 2023. And I would say it\u2019s getting a little bit more dovish, a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two quarters ago. And that too, will affect capital markets opportunity because it\u2019s really tied to confidence. So, I think we are going through that. I don\u2019t think anything has fundamentally changed. I think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. But you shouldn\u2019t look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn\u2019t look at 2021 is normal. They normalized somewhere in the middle.\nJim Mitchell: Right. And maybe just a follow-up on the reserve and provisioning. That\u2019s obviously been a big drag in profitability as you grow the platform business. But as you shrink Marcus, is there also any desire to kind of slow. I know GreenSky is growing on balance sheet, but the rest of the business is that slow? Do we start to see provisioning slow and given how high your reserve levels already are? Just trying to get a better picture on how to think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. And so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. That being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. So, that\u2019s also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. You notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. That\u2019s a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. And so we have made some adjustments, which reflect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: Since there are no more questions, we would like to thank everyone for joining the call. And certainly, if additional questions arise, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon and seeing many of you at our Investor Day on February 28th. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Carey and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I will begin with a review of our financial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter. FICC and equity activities - activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients and our equity investment portfolio saw continued headwinds. We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the year, quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter. We always strive to maintain a pay-for-performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower. That said we also recognize that we operate in a talent-driven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our world class franchise. On our earnings call last July, we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our non-compensation costs. We have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources, especially in light of the worse-than-expected backdrop in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced the size of our balance sheet, further optimized and reduced our RWA footprint and managed down our G-SIB score to hit our 3% target. We have also started firm-wide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and right-size the firm for the current environment. We made the difficult decision to conduct a 6% headcount reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we had paused our regular performance management-related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in headcount given the opportunity set in 2021. We feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions. They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals and we wish them the best. Additionally, we are taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create shareholder value. For instance, this quarter, we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey. We also narrowed our ambitions on our consumer strategy and made some key decisions. We started a process to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform. We will likely allow the book to roll down naturally, although we are considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product. At the right time in the future, we intend to offer checking to our wealth management clients. For now, our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky. Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses. We are very focused on developing a path toward profitability and platform solutions and we will provide more detail at our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us \u2013 for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inflation, but some we never thought we would see like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren't many signs of widespread distress, balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy, but it's clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., central bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy. And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near-term. They are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer term plans. Many firms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control. Taking a step back, I am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. We generated double-digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove significant market disruption with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. We reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. We also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our first Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor. That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for. As we go forward, we are executing on three key priorities we have laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees in our asset and wealth management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities and our global banking and markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver profitability. We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have the people in place around the world to serve our clients' broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. We look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I will now turn it over to Denis. So, thanks, Glenn and I appreciate the question. Obviously, an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. We talk about our targets in a normalized environment. One thing I just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management. This certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet and asset management. And we have made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very significant asset management balance sheet larger than we would like to have. We reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward. But given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it's not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. And if you look at the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter, it earned zero, even with some businesses in there that are highly profitable, I don't think that's normal. I don't think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way. And so I think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. I'd highlight last year, we way outperformed the peer average ROE by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed, and we're just more sensitive to that. Well, I think, Glenn, the big thing in that, and it's always been a big part of it is the shift from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. Our organic growth across our asset management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry. We continue to grow our management fees in the asset management business. We're continuing to grow our wealth business. Our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. And so it's that mix change, less balance sheet intensity, growth in asset and wealth management, continued financing growth in our core Global Banking and Markets business, which you've seen and continue to grow and then getting these platforms that we have to operate profitably, which we believe we can do. We believe they are good businesses at scale, but they are in a different stage of the development. Those things should make the business more resilient, and that's not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out 3 years ago, and we will amplify again next month at Investor Day. What I think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets heavy and balance sheet intense business had, of course, with a drag from some of the investments we're making in other things. I think, candidly, that it depends on the environment. An environment with massive swing in asset prices continues, we will push it out. If that simply normalizes then the overall economic picture of the firm, in addition to the work we're doing on the expense side that we've gotten focused on, will show a very, very different picture. I'm not going to guess on how that will play out. But again, I'd amplify that I don't think what we saw in 2022 was normal. And certainly, if you go back and look at 15 years of history, it wasn't. I think at the moment, we're extremely focused on in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform and moving forward from here, I do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in asset and wealth management. But certainly, this year, we're focused on the execution. We made an acquisition in asset management last year. We want to integrate NNIP. We want to move forward with that. So I think this year, we will be focused on execution. Good morning. Good morning, Betsy. It is my birthday, and I couldn't be happier to be on this call with you. But thank you. Thank you for that. You want \u2013 I'm happy to take any question. Any question that you have, Mike. You know that. We're happy to take questions both positive and tough. I mean it wasn't a great quarter. So I don't expect all the questions to be easy. Yes. And so I appreciate that. And to \u2013 two comments. First, just on the transparency and information comment, I think this management team, Mike, over the last 4.5 years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of Goldman Sachs, and we remain focused on that. If you have certain feedback on things you'd like to see, etcetera, we really welcome that, and Carey will reach out to you, and we will take that feedback. But we're focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we're doing. Second, on the evolution and the move to this, what I'd say, and this has been something that's been a journey that we started a number of years ago, but the firm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally. And that candidly is a difference than the way Goldman Sachs has been during my tenure at the firm. In terms of our core business of banking and markets, there are synergies that we've been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. I highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our Investor Day. It's long forgotten. But when we did our Investor Day, back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the ROE of the markets business above 10%. That was a big question on the minds of investors. And we look now at our combined banking and markets business, this business, we think, is a leader. It outperforms in terms of its market share and outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser-focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business. We also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our financing business there, and we're very, very focused on that. In asset and wealth management, we've worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business. And as we've said over the last few years, reduce the balance sheet intensity of that. And we're on a journey. Would I like it to be further along? Yes. If it was further along, there would have been less volatility, particularly in the context of this year in the fourth quarter. But we continue \u2013 that's something we laid out 3 years ago, and we continue to move at that. The change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in consumer business, I think, is a change. We continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes. We think our partnership with Apple will provide meaningful dividends for the firm over time. We think GreenSky is a good business that can be accretive, but the platforms are in a different stage of development than our other businesses. They are small in the overall scale of Goldman Sachs, but we think there are benefits to that for the firm. We will communicate more as we move forward around that, but we're making progress and we will continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive profitability. So that's a high-level response. I don't know if there is something else you want me to drill into, but that's a high-level response. Thank you. I think we have been asked this question. I appreciate the question. We have been asked it a bunch over time. I think in certain businesses like asset and wealth management, there are significant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform. We have the fifth largest active asset manager in the world now that we have stood up all the businesses inside Goldman Sachs. And so that scale is real. And there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale. And certainly, there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more significant. I would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. There are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it. Certainly, over the last 5 years, the prices have been eye-popping, maybe we are in a different environment where well, that will normalize. But we are always open to things that we think can strengthen Goldman Sachs, but also as somebody that's been an M&A banker for a significant part of my career, I know the barter do that, the cultural issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very, very high. So, I would say we are always open. But at the moment, our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us, and we think we can drive good returns, good book value growth, good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate. Yes. So, we \u2013 you can take a look at our performance in these businesses. And you can see that the performance is quite strong. A couple of things I will point to even in this quarter's performance. You can look at our relative M&A revenue performance. You can look at our relative FICC performance and even our equities performance in what's been a tough quarter, the relatives look pretty good. We set out 3 years ago, and this was a big structural change. We had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business. We had always thought about them in our investment banking business. And we really \u2013 we brought that ethos into the markets business. And I know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how 3 years ago, we set out to say there are 100 clients that contribute meaningfully to our FICC and equities businesses. And we are top three with only 44 of them. We are now top three with 77 of those top 100. And now we have shifted the focus to really look at okay, top three, but why aren't we wanted to, what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with, and we think there is more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing and ticking equities on that number one and number two position. In banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. That footprint grows candidly has been a little bit expensive when there has been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity, but we think that will serve us well if you take a 3-year or a 5-year view looking forward. So, again, there is a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we are investing in. The core of the firm is very strong. Those wallet shares are strong, but we still see more opportunity and we are laser-focused on continuing to execute on it. And I don't think there is any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business, so we will continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward. Well, I think there are a bunch of things that went right, and there were some things that did not go well. I think we executed well on some things that we didn't execute on others. But the simple thing that I would phrase, Gerard, and I think it's a fair question, is we tried to do too much too quickly. And of course, in the environment that we are in, it's hard to go back when we started in that strategy 6 years ago. We obviously built the deposit business, the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. And I think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes. One of the big changes that affect the pace of the ability to do this and it's different in scaling things like this is CECL is a big change. CECL changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch. So, we have had to adjust to that. The regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years. But I think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, was affecting our execution. I think we probably, in some places, haven't had all the talent that we have needed to execute the way we have wanted. We are making adjustments on that, but by narrowing down the three core things that we are going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the firm. I think we have got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward. And so that's what we are doing. And I \u2013 the takeaway I would like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things and we pivot. We are not married to things. We are willing to change. I think when I go back to our 2020 Investor Day, and I look at what we laid out during that period of time, we have accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things we have laid out. That doesn't mean there is not more work to do. But you know what, we didn't execute perfectly on some. So, we have taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments. And that's kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of Goldman Sachs that I want to amplify. We are always willing to make changes. We are always going to be focused on shareholders. And even though everything has not gone perfectly, again, I would point to our 40% book value growth since our Investor Day, and I map that out. Our book value per share growth, I believe it's more than double the next nearest competitor. And so we are going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long-term. I think we are good at nimbly making adjustments, and we will always be very clear to have when we get things right or we get things wrong. Yes. Sure. I think that \u2013 I think one of the things we are dealing with and it's over-amplified in our very capital market-centric business is that 2021 was not normal. The second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. They were way inflated by the massive fiscal stimulus that created kind of, I would call, on the spectrum of activity, excess activity, pulled a lot of activity forward. And then because of market disruption, we have tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. It's the first year in over 50 years that both fixed income and equity markets were down. We had the S&P down 20%, the NASDAQ down 30%. You had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. And when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. My historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four quarters to six quarters. And so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly, for the next couple of quarters, they are still thinking about $100. But if it's at $70 for four quarters or five quarters, six quarters, then it's $70. And suddenly, when you look ahead and you think about either an M&A transaction or financing, you have more realism about the reset of values. So, I think we are well into that journey of a reset and expectations. I think it might have another quarter or two quarters to further reset, but I think we are starting to see some additional improvements, people point to the investment-grade debt market. That would obviously be where it would come first. But my expectations would be in the back half of \u201823 meaningfully better. And also, it's interesting, and I will be heading to Dallas tonight with others, but I was watching some of the commentary, the macro commentary. People are softening their view of 2023. And I would say it's getting a little bit more dovish, a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two quarters ago. And that too, will affect capital markets opportunity because it's really tied to confidence. So, I think we are going through that. I don't think anything has fundamentally changed. I think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. But you shouldn't look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn't look at 2021 is normal. They normalized somewhere in the middle."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $11.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today. Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking and Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year, down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year. The exceptional performance of our Global Banking and Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for firm-wide performance. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year driven by a significant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty. Advisory revenues, however, were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A as we have for 23 of the last 24 years and we ranked second in equity and equity-related underwriting. We also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from number three last year. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity, but remain solid, particularly in advisory. That being said, clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity. While we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly, we are seeing some positive signs of activity, particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 44% year-on-year. In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC financing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-on-year. The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year. Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter. Across FICC and Equities, financing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client financing activities. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million. Moving on to Page 6. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products. Let's now turn to Page 7 where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year. Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I will turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions. We expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach profitability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-offs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. We anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. We expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our 60% efficiency ratio target as the right place to run the firm. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents a 130 basis point buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter, we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run significantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the firm. We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. I mean things I might add, Glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the [forward] (ph) I think the reason why we're taking action with respect to our headcount footprint and some of our non-compensation expenses is to drive efficiency even further. And as you point out, with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year, we're in a pretty flexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders. Good morning, thank you for that So let me help with some color as it relates to provisions, particularly in the fourth quarter. So order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was about 50%. Net charge-offs about 25%, and the balance attributable to our scenario. I think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter, and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of 2023 is that we began the on-balance sheet originations in our point-of-sale lending platform, GreenSky. And so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. So that's something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year. Sure. Fair question on everybody's mind. As you note, we don't yet have the details. But we give it a lot of thought. We've taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that we will be in a position to respond quickly to that. We do have a long-standing track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. You can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our financial resources that we were able to maneuver them very, very quickly to build capital and change our RWA footprint, given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. So we're standing by for more detail on the rule, but confident that when we get it, we will be able to manage accordingly. Good morning. Sure. Betsy, it's Denis. I'll start with that. So as we indicated, we're going to cease the originations in under Marcus lending. And then furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll off or we may pursue other alternatives. That should free up a bunch of financial resources. We're continued within the overall asset and wealth management segment where the deposit business is resident within the private banking and lending line. That remains a strategic priority for the firm, and we've experienced very good growth there. That business is achieving more and more scale. So that will remain an ongoing focus. I think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending, we will continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. And within the Platform Solutions business, we're now down to three different businesses: transaction banking, the cards platform and our point-of-sale lending business, GreenSky. And our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to profitability. Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses. Sure, Mike, let me take that. So unpacking a couple components. So we exercised a headcount reduction earlier this year, approximately 3,200 employees left the firm. The run rate expense associated with that group was approximately $475 million, and we expect the benefit in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. Beyond that, we have a series of non-compensation expense initiatives. We're setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efficient levels of non-compensation spend. The narrowing of the focus in consumer is important. There are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the offering and capabilities of that. The focus is now narrow. And then finally, as you identify, we have more flexibility with respect to capital deployment, which we intend to take advantage of. So Brennan, a couple of questions. As for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that's the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. So that's what explains the time frame in which the expenses going to be booked. As it relates to compensation expense, variable expense flexibility in the fourth quarter, I guess I would point out a couple of things. One, the overall comp and benefit expense were down 15%. We had grown headcount by 10% additionally. And when you \u2013 that's over $2.5 billion of less compensation and benefit expense, so it's a meaningful number. And if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money are impacted by inflation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our firm on behalf of our clients. And we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. But ultimately, it's a balance. And we have excellent people. We depend on them to deliver for clients. The market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we're in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. Certainly, we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that we are positioned to capture that. So, a couple of things I would point out. As people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the Platform Solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. So, we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate, and we expect to drive a lot of benefit at scale. But as we have discussed and you will observe, we also continue to build our provisions as we scale some of those activities. And so our focus remains singularly on driving towards profitability of this segment, but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate profitability. And we do look forward to trying to help people understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at Investor Day. Sure. Thanks for that question. Now, we are very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business, and it's a business that has particular benefits as we scale activities on it. We have our tech platform up and running. We continue to grow our clients on the platform. They unanimously continued to give us the feedback that it is a very differentiated and attractive platform to be part of. And we have taken that business, as you say, from its inception to larger scale. We think there is a lot of potential for that business on the forward. And we are very focused at this point in time in continuing to drive deposit balances, continue to drive our customer count, further penetrate, as you mentioned, our international expansion continues. We have opened in our fifth country. We now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world. There are true benefits to the network effect of a business like this with global reach. And we continue to see very, very good opportunities for this business. Yes. A couple of comments I would make. So, I think as it relates to the FICC financing, we have a very good opportunity set in front of us. The progress that we have made with the client franchise and our market shares and given the overall backdrop and the availability of financing in the world right now, our clients continue to come to us. And given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel incremental financing activities in the FICC business. On the equity side of the equation, obviously, asset markets moved around quite severely, particularly in the end of the year, which drives prime brokerage balances. But as you know, we are also working very hard to reduce our financial resource footprint, particularly our G-SIB level. That brought with it significant RWA reductions. And it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth, certainly in the fourth quarter. I think as we turn the page on a New Year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity financing activities, and we have less constraints given that we have now achieved the 3% G-SIB target. Sure. So, we always have a very, very broad portfolio of funds. And we have been in this investing business for a number of decades, and it's one of the contributors to our position as the number five largest active asset management firm in the world. And across the portfolio of different funds, we have some extremely mature businesses. Our GS Capital Partners, equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds. We have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. And we continued to diversify and expand our offering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand. So, as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global, broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many different types of investors, many of which are very, very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer. Sure. So, we continue to focus on market share. Market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year, it shows that we continued to grow market share in those businesses, sales and trading. So, that remains a very, very core focus of the firm. We continue to make progress, and we think we can make incremental progress. One of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of different business lines, which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. The last year, given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world, were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business, the commodities business. Meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities. Certainly, if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications on the investment-grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there is a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new offerings that we should be able to capture, given the investment that we have made in the client franchise. So, I can't predict exactly where activity will come from 2023. Certainly, some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022. But it's quite possible that certain activities that were softer in \u201822 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023. Sure. So, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. And so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. That being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. So, that's also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. You notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. That's a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. And so we have made some adjustments, which reflect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to The Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 18, 2022. Thank you.  Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined this morning by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. Global economy continues to face significant headwinds. Inflation remains high. Central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in decades. Meanwhile, equity markets are well off the recent highs. Geopolitical instability and energy shocks are an ongoing concern and GDP growth expectations are declining. Many of these trends accelerated towards the end of the quarter. For example, while our own financial conditions index has indicated steady tightening all year, we saw a sharp increase in the index starting in mid-August. Everywhere I go, macro themes dominate. My conversations with CEOs, they tell me that they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans. As we head into the fourth quarter, my sense is that the outlook will remain unsettled, though economic performance will vary by region. I also expect volatility to persist as markets continue to digest these factors. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased that Goldman Sachs delivered solid results during third quarter. As I\u2019ve said before, the breadth and strength of our global franchise is a key differentiator for us and client engagement remains strong. For the quarter we generated net revenues of $12 billion, earnings per share of $8.25, return on equity of 11% and a return on tangible equity of 12%.  Before handing it over to Denis to review the quarterly results in detail, I would like to spend a moment on our strategic evolution. Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. Four years ago, we set out to enhance our client engagement efforts with a goal of further strengthening our world-class client franchise. Our One Goldman Sachs philosophy was born out of that endeavor, starting with a 30 client pilot, evolving to what has now become the operating ethos of the firm. One Goldman Sachs has been successful well beyond our expectations, proving that the strength and breadth of our global client relationships are key drivers of the execution of our strategy and continued outperformance. These efforts have produced leading share gains, particularly in our core businesses, and have resulted in a 40% book value per share growth since our Investor Day in 2020.  The execution of One Goldman Sachs over the last four years has amplified two foundational elements of our firm. First, the relationship and advisory mindset that underlies our Investment Banking franchise translates exceptionally well across client engagement more broadly. Second, the increasingly symbiotic nature of our businesses creates a virtuous ecosystem that results in a significant multiplier effect and drives market share. Because of this, we're making a series of organizational changes in the fourth quarter to take the next step in the evolution of our strategy. Changes will further strengthen our core businesses, accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efficiency.  As you can see on Page 3, we are integrating our Asset and Wealth Management businesses, as well as our Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses into two important segments of the firm. We will also create a new segment called Platform Solutions that will consolidate our fintech platforms from across the firm, including Transaction Banking, Consumer Partnerships, and GreenSky. This segment will enhance our focus on building platforms that deliver digital financial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. We will further integrate our direct-to-consumer activities into Wealth Management given the growing convergence of Wealth and Consumer banking. We will report our full year 2022 earnings using these three segments and will also host an Investor Day on February 28, 2023. We look forward to reviewing the details of our forward strategy across the businesses, although we will tell you now that our fundamental strategy remains the same and we will be maintaining our principal financial targets. We are excited about the role that Asset and Wealth Management will play in our forward growth plans. Across Asset and Wealth Management, we are operating a fully scaled and integrated franchise providing advice, solutions and execution for institutions and individuals across both public and private markets. Running these businesses together will allow us to holistically drive towards our $10 billion and $2 billion management fee targets. Our investment selection and performance for our clients has supported strong momentum, particularly in alternatives and Wealth Management.  We also believe that reaching and serving employees in their workplace is a significant growth opportunity for Goldman Sachs. Through our strengthening capabilities in Workplace and Personal Wealth, we can now address all the employees at the companies we serve. This expanded offering is a direct response to a clear push from C-Suite leaders for more democratized suite of advice and solutions. It's also clear that these clients prefer an integrated wealth management and banking offering, which presents us with a tremendous opportunity to connect with millions of clients through their workplace. Over the past few years, Global Markets and Investment Banking have been increasingly operating as a unified, leading, world-class franchise. We are the advisor of choice supported by a #1 league table positions across M&A and ECM, and we continue to bolster our leading position as a market maker and risk intermediary for our clients in markets across the globe.  As the world has gotten more complex and our clients' demands have evolved, we are seeing that more and more of them are partnering with both Global Markets and Investment Banking to meet their needs. Synergies across these businesses from advice, financing, risk distribution and hedging allows us to deliver differentiated solutions to our clients. This creates a significant multiplier effect and has helped us drive market share gains across the franchise in recent years. Running these businesses together will enable us to maximize our wallet share. Turning to Page 4. Platform Solutions is an end-to-end primarily cloud-based technology platform business that embeds our best-in-class financial products and services into our clients' ecosystems to serve them and their clients and customers. In recent years, we saw opportunity to leverage our preeminent corporate franchise, world-class risk management and innovative culture to build modern digital products and in the process, diversify our revenues and funding mix. We have built and launched a Transaction Banking platform, a digital Consumer Banking platform, the largest piece of which is credit card and we acquired GreenSky. These platforms have led to partnerships with a number of our clients such as Apple, General Motors, Stripe, American Express and Fiserv. Through our relationships with Apple and General Motors, we already have the ability to access more than 100 million individuals in the U.S. Combination of our brand in Apple is unique as proven by the reaction to Apple Card, which has been ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for two consecutive years by J.D. Power. We have also extended our partnership to new products. This last week, we introduced a new Goldman Sachs savings account for Apple Card that allows users to grow their rewards in a high yield savings account and to add funds to a linked banking account or directly from Apple Cash. This embeds a high yield savings account from Goldman Sachs directly into the Apple Card experience in Apple Wallet. Goldman Sachs and Apple are committed to expanding our relationship, and we have recently extended and adjusted our partnership through the end of the decade in order to continue to help consumers with healthier financial lives. In Transaction Banking, we are delivering a differentiated developer-centric cloud-based product that allows for seamless integration into our clients' ecosystems. We are extremely encouraged by the client feedback and adoption rate of the offering. We now have approximately 425 active clients, with greater than $70 billion in deposits globally as we leverage our corporate franchise to become the partner of choice in the payments arena. Our priority in Platform Solutions for the next few years is to continue to diversify Goldman Sachs revenue and funding while driving profitability. We will look forward to talking to you more about this segment at our Investor Day in February. Let me now address some additional details on our Consumer business. Since 2016, we've made a significant investment. And on Page 5, you can see what we've achieved as a result. We serve over 15 million customers and generated more than $2.2 billion in revenues in the last 12 months. We've learned a lot in the six years since launching the deposit business, and this is shaping our execution priorities as we move forward. Turning to Page 6. For our direct-to-consumer strategy, we will focus on existing deposit customers and consumers that we already have access to through channels like Workplace and Personal Wealth rather than seeking to acquire customers on a mass scale. The purposeful change that will allow us to rationalize spend on future builds and customer acquisition costs. In Workplace and Personal Wealth alone, we already have the ability to reach over 9 million individuals. Our Marcus deposit customers remain core to our broader efforts. We will continue to grow the deposit offering and the level of service that has generated over [$110 billion] of retail deposits. We believe that all of our customers across all products will benefit from this reprioritization. Before I turn it over to Denis to go through the results for the quarter, I want to highlight the following. Over the last four years, this leadership team has been working hard to grow, diversify and strengthen Goldman Sachs. Our experience forms this new direction so that we can better serve our clients and amplify our strengths. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey, setting us up to deliver on our targets and unlock shareholder value. Consistent with our strategy, we are focusing on the execution -- we're focusing our execution on 3 key priorities, as you can see on Page 7, which are to grow management fees, maximize wallet share and grow financing activities and scale Platform Solutions to deliver pretax profitability. We'll talk more about this at our Investor Day in February. I will now turn it over to Denis.\nDenis Coleman : Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 8 of the presentation. As David mentioned, we generated earnings per share for the third quarter of $8.25. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered a return on common equity of 12.2% and a return on tangible equity of 13.1%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 9. Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.6 billion, down 57% versus a very strong quarter a year ago. Financial advisory revenues were $972 million, down 41% versus record performance in the third quarter last year. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our #1 league table position year-to-date and expanded our lead. Equity underwriting net revenues were $241 million, reflecting limited industry-wide activity. Nonetheless, we continue to rank #1 year-to-date in equity and equity-related offerings. Debt underwriting net revenues were $328 million, given muted issuance volumes across both high yield and investment grade.  While activity remained slow this quarter, our backlog is robust, particularly in advisory and equity underwriting. Our advisory dialogues continue to be strong, though clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of certain deal and financing-related activity. Corporate lending generated net revenues of $35 million as solid performance in middle market lending and Transaction Banking was largely offset by headwinds on certain hedges in our portfolio and marks in leverage lending. Moving to Global Markets on Page 10. Segment net revenues were $6.2 billion in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year, as client engagement and activity remains strong. Financing activities continued to demonstrate stable growth, comprising approximately 30% of the total revenues in this segment. Turning now with FICC on Page 11. Revenues were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, 41% higher than the third quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $2.8 billion, up 40% year-over-year. We saw strength across our rates, currencies and commodities franchises amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and volatility. In FICC financing, we generated a 41% increase in revenues driven by increased opportunities across repo and mortgage lending. We remain focused on growing this business in support of our clients' financing needs. Our FICC lending portfolio is conservatively underwritten and well collateralized. Moving to Equities. Net revenues in the third quarter were $2.7 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 19% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment and lower client activity. In Equities financing, we generated near-record revenues of $1.1 billion as we supported client financing activities despite lower prime balances. Moving to Asset Management on Page 12. Asset Management net revenues were $1.8 billion. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, roughly flat relative to last quarter and up 42% year-over-year, reflecting management fees from NNIP and the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds. Equity investments generated revenues of $527 million in the third quarter. More specifically, our public equity portfolio produced approximately $215 million of revenues primarily driven by gains on two investments. Across our private portfolio, we generated approximately $310 million of net revenues. We saw event-driven gains of over $350 million for various positions in our portfolio and operating revenues of roughly $150 million from our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially offset by approximately $200 million of marks driven by several investments in the consumer and TMT sectors. Given current market conditions, our harvesting of on-balance sheet investments was limited in the third quarter, but we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. We continue to make progress on our fundraising targets, securing $12 billion of alternative commitments this quarter. We also closed West Street Capital Partners VIII, our flagship private equity fund, which at $9.7 billion was significantly above its original target. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $231 million, primarily reflecting net interest income of $267 million. I'll now turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on Page 14. We produced record net revenues of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, up 18% versus a year ago, driven by significantly higher net revenues in Consumer Banking. For the quarter, despite the market headwinds, management and other fees of $1.2 billion were relatively flat sequentially as net market depreciation was largely offset by strong client net inflows. Private banking and lending net revenues reached a record of $395 million, up 35% year-over-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $744 million in the third quarter, nearly double the third quarter of 2021, reflecting higher credit card balances and improved deposit spreads. Moving on to Page 15. Total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion. Combined firm-wide management and other fees in the third quarter rose 15% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. On Page 16, total firm-wide net interest income of $2 billion in the third quarter was up 18% relative to the second quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $177 billion, up slightly versus the second quarter as growth in credit cards and Wealth Management loans was offset by a decrease in real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses was $515 million, primarily driven by growth in our consumer lending portfolio, net charge-offs and worsening economic indicators, particularly in Europe. The credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient as reflected by minimal net impairments in the quarter. On the Consumer side, though we are seeing some signs of credit deterioration and an increase in charge-offs, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations. That said, we're closely monitoring the portfolio and actively using our underwriting in light of the softening macroeconomic outlook. Let's turn to expenses on Page 17. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion. Our compensation ratio year-to-date net of provisions was 32.5%. Through the third quarter, our compensation and benefits expenses are down over 20% relative to 2021. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by ongoing integration and run rate expenses related to the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions, $191 million in litigation reserves and higher transaction-based expenses. We remain highly focused on operating efficiency. As we've previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts, and we expect that these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time. Turning to capital on Slide 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially and representing a 100 basis point buffer to our current capital requirement. In the third quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and common stock dividends of $893 million. As a reminder, our GSIB surcharge will increase by 50 basis points in January 2023, bringing our CET1 ratio requirement to 13.8%. We will continue to target a buffer of 50 basis points to 100 basis points above this requirement. In conclusion, our solid third quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We are mindful of the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, and we will prudently manage our resources and maintain a risk-sensitive orientation as we continue to serve our clients. I share David's enthusiasm of the opportunities ahead of us. The further alignment of our businesses will help drive the organization forward. Successful execution of our strategic priorities, growing management fees, maximizing wallet share and scaling platform solutions will further strengthen the firm and unlock shareholder value. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.\nGlenn Schorr : I appreciate your macro comments. I was wondering, in private markets specifically, I feel like those markets have changed as well or hopefully only temporary, but great time to be a private lender in private credit. And you're big in that, but not as a great time to be in private equity for marks or capital raising. So I wonder if you could talk as both manufacturer and distributor, just maybe a state of the union in general and then if you could weave that into your thoughts on your gross alternative fundraising target of $225 billion and $2 billion in management fees.\nDavid Solomon : Sure. So thanks for the question, Glenn. And look, at a high level, the targets remain in place. And our confidence in the targets and our ability to deliver those targets is high, and we're very focused on them. We continue to make progress in the fundraising, and we highlighted it in the context of the script. And we have a series of offerings that are coming over the course of the next 18 months. And while certainly I'd say that private equity fundraising environment is more constrained and the alternative fundraising environment is broadly more constrained, I would highlight just the fact that we have a very, very broad franchise, a very, very diverse sense of offering at -- sets of offerings and that there's a lot of opportunity that comes out of an environment like this. And I actually think from a vintage perspective, the opportunity to put money to work in this environment when we look forward and then when we look back, it's probably something that will be very, very attractive. We're obviously shifting the macro environment, as we've talked about. That's going to create headwinds around valuations, and there's been a big reset. On the other hand, if you have dry powder or you have interesting strategies -- you highlighted some. I think lending strategies will be quite attractive in this environment. I think there's good institutional capital and, candidly, good capital out of the wealth channel still available to support these strategies. So we're taking a long-term approach to growing these businesses. The businesses are growing nicely. We've set targets that we'll continue to meet. And I know that if we have a good broad offering for our clients, that we'll continue to have success in this. And candidly, this is one of the reasons why we're integrating Asset and Wealth Management is as we believe by putting these platforms together, we have the best eye and the best breadth to really understand where the opportunities are to serve our clients and also where the opportunities are for good performance.\nDenis Coleman : And Glenn, I can add from an alternatives perspective, we mentioned growth of $12 billion in new commitments in the quarter. That brings year-to-date to $57 billion, just shy of $60 billion. We now sit at $164 billion towards our increased $225 billion target. We continue to migrate our alternatives into AUS that sits now at $256 billion of alternatives AUS. So despite the environment, we continue to make progress towards our fundraising goals, particularly in alternatives.\nGlenn Schorr : Thanks for that, Denis, and David. Maybe a related follow-up on RWA. Is that a little bit in the quarter? I appreciate you took share and lots of volatility, so that has a bunch of moving parts. But curious your just overall approach towards optimizing RWA. And then maybe a specific question related to FICC financing. And it was up 41%. It's great, making good money. Does that come at paying better or worse return on risk-weighted assets as intermediation?\nDenis Coleman : Glenn, thank you -- thanks for the question on RWA. As you note, our RWAs were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We have been focused on managing our RWA footprint tightly. Within that number, you'll see reductions in terms of market-based RWAs and increases in credit RWAs. And we're being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy RWA capacity to drive efficiencies as well as scale franchise growth activities. And FICC financing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our RWA deployment. And so that's one of the reasons why you see the ongoing focus in the growth of the FICC financing line.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak : So wanted to start with a question on expenses. You spoke of expense mitigation efforts as part of the broader realignment strategy. What's the level of non-comp inflation we should be contemplating? Recognizing we're still dealing with inflationary headwinds. You alluded to more proactive measures to mitigate expense growth. Just want to get a sense if the goal is to actually slow non-comp growth or to deliver absolute reductions in expense.\nDavid Solomon : Thanks for the question, Steven. I'll start at just a high level, and then Denis will go to the details with you in terms of how we're thinking about it. But I do think there are different factors that are leading to the expense growth, but one is there is definitely an inflationary pressure that's affecting certain aspects of the business. We're obviously looking at that and thinking about that carefully. I do think we're making investments across the platform, particularly in certain technology infrastructure, and that's having an impact in the medium-term. We think those are investments that we need to make. At the same point, though, given the environment, we're extremely focused on trying to mitigate any expense growth to the degree we can. Now there are going to be headwinds given the natural inflation that sets in, but why don't I have Denis kind of walk through and break down some of the different components that we've been focused on?\nDenis Coleman : Sure. So if we take a step back, we look at our overall level of operating expenses year-to-date, they're down 6% compared to the prior year-to-date period. They are up 1% sequentially, drivers obviously across both comp and non-comp. If you look at the non-compensation growth over the course of the last year, roughly half of that is attributable to expenses associated with the integration and run rate of NNIP and GreenSky together with change in litigation. So that is representing about half. On the balance, as David indicated, we do see some impact from inflation. We do see the impact of higher levels of transaction-based expenses, but we are also taking actions to reduce expenses within the overall non-compensation category where we can. You may note that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we reduced our professional fees, something that we indicated in our previous earnings release. And we're going to continue to think very, very disciplined about the way in which we deploy non-compensation expenditures striking the balance of driving towards our efficiency ratio but as well as making the investments that we think are appropriate to continue to strengthen and grow the firm.\nSteven Chubak : That's great. And maybe just a question for my follow-up on the equity investment portfolio. Given the challenging equity market backdrop, certainly, the revenues came in better than expected. There's also been some increased scrutiny more favorable marks on some of these private equity portfolios. And just given the better revenue outcome and a pretty heavy concentration in areas like TMT and real estate, which have come under pressure, I was hoping you could speak to what drove some of the better results this quarter, anything idiosyncratic worth flagging?\nDenis Coleman : Sure. Thank you, Steven. Let me cover that in a bit of detail for you. So obviously, on the $527 million equity line, there's a number of components. As we mentioned previously, we have a public equity portfolio, and that contributed positively north of $200 million for the third quarter. And then also within the private portfolio, you have a number of things that are going on within our private equity portfolio. We have roughly $0.5 billion of event-driven gains that came through over the course of the third quarter, whether those be capital raising activities, strategic transactions or the operating expenses from our CIEs, those positive gains were offset by markdowns in our private equity portfolio, particularly in TMT and Consumer.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala : I guess maybe just going back, David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about rationalize spend. The segment realignment makes a ton of sense. Just give us a sense from the outside as we think about the rationalization of the spend, does this lead to you achieving your strategic targets around costs, ROE at a faster pace? Or do you have a high degree of confidence that you get there relative to the previous plan and understanding the core tenants are the same? But just give us a sense of just your confidence in achieving those targets despite the market backdrop as we look forward and how does the alignment supports that?\nDavid Solomon : Sure. And so first, I just want to amplify, I said in the script, we continue to be committed to our forward targets. And there's nothing about the environment or the way we're running the firm that doesn't lead us to believe that we can deliver on the targets that we would set over the course of the coming years, whether the return target or also the efficiency target that we've set. And we're tracking a number of KPIs and continue to be very focused on that. The realignment of the firm is really driven by our ability to serve clients. That is the most important thing that's coming out of this. And we've been very, very focused on wallet share and client share broadly. We've made real improvements over the last few years, and we think this further aligns those goals and that capability. Now in this realignment, we are making a purposeful shift as we think about our direct-to-consumer business. And I'd just highlight that one of the things that changes by aligning our direct-to-consumer business with our wealth business and people that are on our wealth platform is that the forward spend for customer acquisition is meaningfully lower. And so of course, as you look at that, that's helpful in the overall returns of the firm. But I would highlight that just the numbers, either way we were looking at it are small in the context of businesses, our core businesses, banking and markets, asset and wealth management. And I don't think any of this was having a big impact on our ability to meet our targets or the pace at which we will meet our targets. We do think, and this is why we're doing this, that this is a better way for us to align the business and move the business forward. And so that's why we've made this purposeful shift. But again, I'd just amplify, these are not big numbers in the context of our meeting our targets when you look at the overall performance of the firm.\nEbrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And I guess just one follow-up in terms of -- you talked about organic growth opportunities in private lending given market dislocations. There are a lot of asset values that have been hit, too. Just remind us in terms of M&A, where you're focused on and just appetite to execute M&A.\nDavid Solomon : Well, at the moment, we continue to be extremely focused on our businesses and the growth and the things that we have on our plate in front of us. As you know, we made a couple of acquisitions. We're in the process of integrating those acquisitions in. And at the moment, that's where our focus lies. As we go forward in the future, if there are opportunities to accelerate the growth, particularly in Asset and Wealth Management, we'll consider them. But at the moment, we remain very focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing on the things that we have in front of us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu : Just trying to better understand the point of the reorganization of the businesses. What does this reorg mean practically for the businesses? What can they do today that they couldn't be before the reorg? I guess kind of when I listen to you, other than scaling back on consumer acquisition, I'm struggling to understand what the broader point of the reorg really is?\nDavid Solomon : Christian, we've been -- it's interesting because I know you follow us closely, and we've been talking about a variety of things in this. If you go back to our investor update at the beginning of the year, we highlighted a lot of the synergies between banking and markets and how we were working to get those client activities more closely aligned. We also highlighted in our update at the beginning of the year the synergies between Asset and Wealth. And then when John spoke at the Bernstein conference in May, we put a big, big spotlight on the synergies we thought bringing Asset Management and Wealth Management closer together. So it's not that by doing this that we're doing something dramatically different. We've been driving the firm in this direction with respect to client service and One GS for a number of years. And we think as we've done that and we've looked at that and we've learned, we think by organizing the firm this way, it makes it easier for investors to understand and see how we look at our client set and how we're operating against that client set. And so we view it as a natural progression that strengthens our ability to deliver for clients. And so that's why we've moved in this direction. That's with the big businesses, banking and markets and Asset and Wealth Management. On Platform Solutions, we have a bunch of these platforms where we're making investments. We think they're very interesting. They're growing. They require more focus. This alignment of them allows us to shine a brighter, more transparent light on them. And we're very committed to driving them to profitability and a meaningful contribution over time. And we think by organizing this way, it allows us to maintain that focus on what is a small piece of the business, but one that I think in the future allows us a differentiated opportunity to serve our corporate and institutional clients.\nChristian Bolu : Got you. Okay. Maybe switching on to Consumer. I mean just looking back over time, what lessons have you guys learned in terms of trying to execute in this business? If I think about the thesis that Goldman outlined as far back as 2016 in terms of building a full-scale digital bank, that was a great thesis, right? It's actually played out. You've seen a bunch of smaller new banks like Square and Chime really do a good job of building that. One could argue that there's been some execution challenges for Goldman on Consumer. You've had multiple leadership changes. Now it feels like we're sort of breaking up some of the businesses and putting them in different parts of the organization. So just stepping back a little bit here, kind of what lessons have you learned in terms of execute on Consumer? And what is that -- how do you take that going forward to build that business?\nDavid Solomon : Well, I think, Christian, what -- the steps that we've taken today are reflective of the learnings. And whenever you innovate and you build new platforms and new things, you're always going to be constantly looking and examining what you're doing and saying what have we learned, how can we do this better? I'd say I'm very proud of the team in our Consumer business, the markets team broadly. When I look at the deposit platform that's been built and the growth from zero to over $110 billion of deposits over the last six years, we have 15 million customers on the platform. I think we have a very unique credit card technology that's differentiated. We have a couple of extraordinary partnerships. I think that when you look at all of that together, we have some very good things, but one of the things I think we've learned is that the ability to scale that and attract customers and the direct-to-consumer business needs to be focused in a more directed way. And so we're focusing it by aligning it with our Wealth business where we have access to millions of people. And so I still see a terrific opportunity to take what a really, really interesting digital products and in being aligned with our Wealth business, provide those products and services to clients and customers at Goldman Sachs.  In addition, I think the partnerships that we've built also provide good opportunities for us to serve corporate clients with very, very interesting digital capabilities and allow them to ultimately serve their end customers or clients. And so yes, there have been bumps. Not everything has been perfect. I think that always happens when you're innovating. But I also think we've built meaningful things that create meaningful opportunities for the firm as we go forward. And in particular, our ability to have a more diversified funding base and a big deposit platform that we can grow from here and an ability to offer Wealth customers on our platform a broad array of services, I think, positions us well as we move forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck : So two questions. First, a follow-up on the conversation just now. Is there anything that you're going to be fading as a result of this? Is there any part of the Consumer business that you're not going to do anymore? And I know you did the renegotiation with Apple Card. I guess it's through 2029, if I got it right. And how is that restructured in a way to enhance your ability to generate revenues from that? Because I know you mentioned on CNBC this morning, David, that the balances aren't being carried as much as had been expected.\nDavid Solomon : So there's no -- the first part of your question, Betsy, there's no aspect of the services that we're offering to consumers that we don't continue to offer. The big thing, though, is this alignment that we are aligned with our Wealth business, and that gives us an audience of millions of people that we can focus on with lower customer acquisition costs and their lower forward spend as we grow or add those services to people. With respect to the Apple Card, I made a statement this morning that we extended and amended the partnership with Apple. I just highlighted that it's very unusual for two partners to change one of these partnerships in the middle of a partnership like this. But I think it goes to the fact that it's a very, very strong partnership where there's a lot of opportunity, but because we were doing something innovative with the technology and embedding the technology and Apple's platform, there were different results than we had expected. I mean one of the positive results was very, very good for consumers, if consumers have an ability and, therefore, are more actively paying down their credit card balances more quickly. That led to different modeled results in terms of what kind of balances you'd have with a certain population on the platform. And so in looking at the forward arrangement, the platform has to work for both us and Apple. Apple believe that. We believe that. And so we made changes to make sure that this is attractive for both of us as we move forward and continue to try to deliver really valuable digital financial wellness and access to consumers that are on the platform.\nBetsy Graseck : And then just on a separate topic, but the question is on the GSIB surcharge. And I think over the past couple of quarters, you've highlighted how you've been looking to take action to bring your GSIB score down such that you don't trip into that next 50 bp bucket in Jan '24. Could you give us a sense as to the progress there this quarter and if that goal is still on the table for year-end?\nDenis Coleman : Betsy, it's Denis. Thanks for that question. Our position is, we remain focused on targeting the 3% GSIB, same message we gave at the end of the second quarter. We're one quarter closer to the end of the year. We are on track to achieve the 3% GSIB level. As we indicated in the second quarter, I would reiterate now that should the opportunity set with clients or the market generally change, we could pivot away from that. But from where we sit right now today, looking into year-end, we remain focused on the 3% GSIB.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo : I have two easy questions that I'll requeue for, but I'll ask my harder questions now, if I'm able to requeue. On Slide 5, you say that Consumer revenues were $2.2 billion for the last 12 months. What were the earnings for the Consumer? And the reason I ask that is there's all sorts of news articles, and I'm not sure if it's a lot of money. And I just don't know if that's the case or not or to what degree, and that makes sense in any start-up that you'd be investing along the J curve and you lose money at first and you make money down the road. So how is Consumer from a financial standpoint, from an earnings standpoint panning out in relation to your original expectations?\nDavid Solomon : So Mike, we're not giving complete transparency on the four-wall look at the Consumer business. It doesn't make money at the moment. I'm not going to go further than that. But what I will say, the deposits are hugely valuable. And we do believe as the platform scales and you stop the pace of growth that we've had, so you're not front-loading reserves the same way, that what we're doing will deliver accretive returns to the firm. And so we continue to feel very, very confident with that. Not everything that's reported is accurate and reflects the journey of innovating and building something like this, but we continue to feel very good about what we've built. We're making some shifts that we think play to our strength and strengthen our ability to accelerate the pace of these tools, this activity contributing to the firm. I'd highlight that the overall performance and the firm -- the firm's overall performance and our targets remain the same. And so again, I know this gets a lot of attention. I understand why it gets a lot of attention, and that's all okay. But we've set targets. We're going to deliver on those targets, and we're going to make investments in things that we think strengthen the firm, and this is one of them.\nMichael Mayo : All right. I guess the reason I asked the question -- I mean, look, for the last five, 10, 20, 150 years, right, your strength has been serving your corporate relationships, investment banking. And look, that's your legacy, too, the strength there. And so when I'm looking at this third division, Platform Solutions, the first two divisions are based on how you address the clients based on distribution, One Goldman Sachs. Whereas the third division, Platform Solution, seems to be based on how you manufacture solutions. So that just seems like a little disconnect. So just a little bit more color. I know you'll talk about it at your newly announced Investor Day, but distribution, and this is based on how you manufacture clients. I'm just trying to reconcile with the Goldman Sachs history and what you're doing elsewhere.\nDavid Solomon : Well, I appreciate that, Mike. And look, it's very generous of you to account 150 years of history, but I just highlight firm looked very different in the 1860s than it looked in the 1920s, than it looked in the 1960s. The firm continues to grow and change. I joined Goldman Sachs in 1999, and it was 23 years ago as a partner, it was a fraction of what Goldman Sachs is today. So we're a big business. We have very big businesses. And of course, our Investment Banking and markets business is core to who we are. It will continue to be core to who we are. It drives our earnings and performance. It drives what we're associated with. . We've built over a number of decades a very, very powerful Asset and Wealth Management business, what we're bringing together today. We're the fifth largest active asset manager in the world, and we think we've got a real opportunity to grow that. I understand now that people accept that as being core to Goldman Sachs. When we started back in the '80s, I don't think people viewed it as core. But we also have 11,000 engineers here, and we're doing some very, very interesting things as the world is changing and the world is evolving with technology. After the financial crisis, the regulatory structure came, and we became a bank. And it was clear we needed deposits and we needed to diversify our funding. And so what Platform Solutions represents is a handful of smaller business opportunities relative to the scale of Goldman Sachs that we're investing in where we think we have a capability to serve our clients. We've, I think, done some very interesting things in Transaction Banking, as we've outlined. I think this card partnership is very, very interesting in terms of what it's allowing us to do. And so we think it's an opportunity. It's still small relative to Goldman Sachs. It's less than 5%, but we think it's an opportunity worth investing into as we continue to broaden the scope and scale of what Goldman Sachs can do for our clients. And that's kind of the way we're thinking about it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. .\nBrennan Hawken : I've got two questions and one is on the Consumer pivot, but I feel like we need a break. So let me just add the other one first. You guys -- how should we be thinking about the efficiency ratio this year? The last six months have been tougher revenue-wise. And so the medium -- we've been above your medium-term target of 50 -- 60%, sorry. Non-comp expense is a little sticky. You guys laid out some of the things that you're trying to do there. But do you think that -- do you fully expect that you'll be hitting your 60% ratio target this year on the efficiency front?\nDenis Coleman : Brennan, I'll take that for you. Thanks for the question. As David indicated earlier, we remain very committed to our firm-wide targets, and we're going to look to achieve them over the medium term. The efficiency ratio is one of those. We will not necessarily hit that target each and every year. This is probably one of those years. It's not been a top quartile environment for performance. But that being said, we are pulling the levers that we can pull. You'll note that our compensation and benefits on a year-to-date basis is down 21%. And we're going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay per performance orientation but also with respect to our targets. And finally, remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight, and our talent is important to our franchise. But you can see the movement we're making in our compensation year-to-date as a component of the overall efficiency ratio. And then on the non-compensation side, that remains very much a focus, and we will look to continue to make progress on non-comp with the goal of driving towards the efficiency target.\nDavid Solomon : But Brennan, just to amplify, we're committed to our efficiency target. It was never meant to be a target that would be hit absolutely in every single year exactly the same way. And so this obviously has been a tougher operating environment, and it's having an impact. But we remain committed to the target and are operating the firm to deliver on that target.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. And then for the next one, just to come back to the -- pivot to Consumer. And apologies for hitting on it again, but I think it's important because want to understand strategically, you all laid out in early 2020, David laid out a lot of the goals and aspirations around Consumer and building this Consumer business. It seems like this shift is a toning down of some of those aspirations. Previously, we had heard that you were looking to launch some general consumer banking to complement the deposit business. And it's -- while you said before that you're not changing the current offering, not completely clear if you're continuing to go forward with the rollout and all of the original aspirations that you were targeting. And just to be honest, when I speak with a lot of investors on Goldman Sachs, very few are excited about the Consumer business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that a pulling back in the aspirations would necessarily be negative. I just want to try and understand strategically what the new direction is.\nDavid Solomon : Yes. No, Brennan, I appreciate that. There's no question that the aspiration is probably got more communicated in a way that they were broader than where we're now choosing to go. And we are making it clear that we're going back on some of that. Now we have built some things. We have a checking platform. We have an investing platform. And if you are aligning us with wealth and you have wealth customers, wealth customers can use those things, but it's very, very different to have those capabilities and be able to use them on a broad wealth platform versus directly marketing them to independent consumers on mass. And I think one of the big learnings over the last few years is that we're better to play to our strength. And now our focus is -- I think the technology with Gold is very, very good, and we can now connect it to millions of people that are on our platform, and that is a narrowing of the focus for sure. It is a purposeful shift, tried to make that clear in the script. And I think it plays the strength that we have. But we are a bank. We need deposits. We are a wealth platform. People around a wealth platform want an ability to leave money here. Actually, if you look at other wealth platforms, they have banking capabilities attached to them. And so I think we're strengthening our ability as a broad wealth platform. And I want to amplify this workplace wealth channel where we have access to millions of people is a very, very interesting place for us to attach some of the stuff that we've now built. So I think we've made a significant investment. We are narrowing our focus very clearly, but I still think there are opportunities for us. And again, I want to amplify our other businesses are performing. They drive the overall results. This is still small in the overall scheme of Goldman Sachs, but we think that it's additive, and that's why we're trying to focus it and drive it forward in the best way. And I appreciate the comment that shareholders haven't been excited about it. And that certainly affects some of our decision-making.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan : I want to ask a question just on Investment Banking. M&A financing markets have obviously become a little more complicated recently and seen some negative marks on recent deals. I'm just curious whether you feel like some of that friction is just transitory or whether financing markets are really starting to maybe become more concerning and crack a bit. And then kind of interrelated, just how much that's weighing on your outlook for M&A advisory business? And where it sounds like backlogs are still solid, but you need functioning financing as well.\nDavid Solomon : Yes. I would say, Devin, at a high level, we're tightening economic conditions very, very quickly. And when you tighten economic conditions, it has an impact on these things. I think the impact lagged a little bit. I do think there's been a big reset in the capital markets for IPOs, for debt financing. People have to get their minds around the valuations, the cost of capital. I think that reset is occurring. History would tell you that capital markets generally don't stay close no matter what the environment. They don't stay closed for years at a time because people have to move forward. They have to operate their businesses. They have to raise capital. And so they adjust to the new environment. That said, the prospects for economic growth are uncertain in 2023. And so I think there are going to be headwinds. So I expect a more cautious or a bumpier capital markets and M&A environment as we head into 2023. I think we need more clarity on the trajectory of the economy and the trajectory of inflation to really see all that stuff accelerate from the levels it's operating at today.\nDevin Ryan : Yes. Okay. Great. A quick follow-up here just on deposits. Deposit rate in markets right now, I think, 2.35%. The delta versus many of your bank peers is widening. And so I'm just curious what you've seen over the last couple of months, especially as customer cash sorting has been accelerating in the industry, and then whether you can just share some expectations from here around what you expect in kind of Marcus deposit gathering just as rates potentially continue to move higher from there.\nDenis Coleman : Sure. Thank you for that question. So maybe just some observations across deposit flows across the firm given the changing environment. On the consumer side of the equation, continuing to perform and outperform our expectations. Our focus is on continuing to attract deposits. We are deliberately positioning ourselves within the competitive envelope. And so -- in such a fashion that we can attract deposits. We do not intend to be the price leader, but we do intend to remain competitive. It's obviously an entirely digital offering. We're not burdened with a lot of other cost and infrastructure. And so we have some flexibility to position our pricing in such a manner that we can attract deposits to continue to grow the firm. Obviously, this is something that will change over the entirety of the cycle. But thus far, it's outperforming our own expectations. On the other hand, institutional activity through Transaction Banking, we're observing that, that is more competitive. There is -- there are more deposits that people are seeking to raise through those channels, being more disciplined. And so we do see more competition for raising deposits through that channel relative to the consumer channel.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon : Wanted to ask about Wealth Management. You had a strong quarter for inflows versus, I think, what we saw in the industry has a bit of a slowdown sequentially, look to be a record inflow quarter for alts for you. Can you just talk about the momentum in that business and how to think about maybe growth from here?\nDenis Coleman : So thank you for acknowledging that. Obviously, on top of that, our overall growth in management and other fees add up 15% year-over-year; in the last quarter, had almost $2.25 billion. We're well on our way to both our $10 billion total and $2 billion alternative fee targets. And the reality of attracting these types of flows over this period in time, a lot of that has to do with work and performance and track record that has been done previously. Some of these particular flows have longer lead times. Other, shorter lead times. But looking at both the alternative commitments that we were able to secure in the quarter, looking at the change to our alternatives U.S. on the quarter, which was very strong, and then looking at our inflows across the more traditional channels, we are very pleased with the activity that we saw in that regard over the course of the third quarter. And we're very focused on continuing to drive that going forward.\nDaniel Fannon : Got it. And then just in the Consumer business, both the consumer banking as well as the private banking lending accelerated quarter-over-quarter, and you gave a handful of reasons. But just thinking about the trajectory for those businesses even in addition of -- with the realignment, just trying to think about momentum on more of the shorter-term basis. The step-ups quarter-over-quarter were quite strong. So just some color -- a little additional color there would be helpful.\nDenis Coleman : Sure. Thank you. I mean, obviously, for the firm overall, loan growth was just about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. But we do continue to see good opportunities, particularly across the Wealth Management segment. You saw better growth in that segment. It's a high-quality lending opportunity for us. And we're leveraging an existing set of relationships in existing franchise that's very much in place. We've obviously been recognized for our advice and solution-oriented way in serving those clients, but we are finding that increasingly, they're looking for us also to provide financing to them. And so we're making sure that we're very focused on supporting them as holistically as possible. And we see good opportunities on the floor to continue to grow those types of financing activities.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor : May I keep calling for the normalization of fixed income trading? And I think over last quarter, you guys tried to frame what might be a good kind of medium, longer-term level. But obviously, it continues to be. And I am wondering, has it reset higher kind of permanently due to likely higher inflation, higher rates? And usually, that does bring higher volatility. Even if things settle down from here, are we just looking at a structurally bigger and maybe materially bigger wallet than we thought not too long ago?\nDavid Solomon : Look, Matt, I think it's always hard to predict. But I think if you want to go back to the period before the pandemic, I do think the level of client activity and a shifting macroeconomic environment has created a larger wallet. I think one of the things that we benefited from, and we continue to try to amplify this, is we've grown our wallet share by over 300 basis points since 2019. So we're benefiting from the fact that the available wallet is larger and has been larger for the last couple of years. But in addition, with 300 basis points of wallet share growth, that's also improved our position. So I do think clients are active. We have a truly global franchise. It's broad. It's deep. We're very, very focused on our market share position with the leading clients. I can't tell you what the future will bring, but I just think that our franchise is extremely well positioned. Whatever that opportunity is, our relative positioning against that opportunity to serve our clients is strong.\nMatthew O'Connor : And in terms of the share gains, how much of it -- so obviously, it sounds that is you're leaning into the business with some investments, including in financing, but how much of it is -- maybe mix has been favorable to you and there's also been some pullback by some global peers as they've been building capital and you obviously have enough to lean into it.\nDavid Solomon : Well, it's hard to pull it apart. I mean if global peers are pulling back capital and resources that they allocate, the people who are committed to it, the big U.S. players are going to benefit. But I actually think the big thing that has driven our share gains is the fundamental shift in the client philosophy of the firm, the investment in the One Goldman Sachs ethos, I think it's had a material impact on our Global Markets business. And I think it's affected our shares. I think the team in that division has executed in a very, very strong way against that. It\u2019s improved our client relationships, improved our positioning materially with the top 100 clients. I know you know that we set out a few years ago and said we were 40 -- we had 44 of the top 100 that we were in the top 3 with. We're now in the top 3 with over 75. That's been a very coherent -- very focused effort to improve our client positioning. I think that's had the biggest impact on our market shares.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy : David, you talked about the need for deposits. And if I recall back on your Investor Day, one of the advantages for growing deposits was the improvement in your funding costs from wholesale funds. With the rise in rates, has that improvement lessened at all? And second, I think you had a goal of getting to 50-50 in terms of funding half of the business with deposits and then wholesale funds. And where do you stand on that?\nDenis Coleman : So thank you, Gerard. It's Denis. So I think as indicated in some of the previous comments and outlined at that original Investor Day, we are very focused on diversifying the funding mix, also benefiting from the pricing and the stickiness of that channel. We've developed, since that period of time, multiple deposit funding channels. The digital markets platform is one of them. Transaction Banking is another. In terms of that original goal of changing the mix, we have achieved that. We continue to be very, very focused on moving that mix. You'll see on a quarter-over-quarter basis that we have improved our deposits, reduced our other unsecured funding. So we remain focused on that. It's an attractive source of funding for us. It also fits within the overall strategic realignment that we've been discussing.\nGerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up in your outlook, David, for what's going on in the capital markets business, obviously, the tightening that we're all seeing. Is it a straightforward in terms of an improvement of the Fed finishing with its monetary tightening and markets rebound quickly after that? Or do you see other factors that have to play in aside from what's going on, of course, with Ukraine and Russia and the European situation?\nDavid Solomon : I don't think it's simple for sure, Gerard. I think it's still pretty uncertain. I do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inflation and, therefore, understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward. The Fed is executing and has sent some very, very clear goals as to where they're going to the tightening cycle in the near term, but I think there's uncertainty whether or not that will get inflation to a place where the policy will shift going forward. And so I think we're in an uncertain period. I think that this warrants, and we're operating the firm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward. But we'll have to watch closely. But I don't have a clear answer for you as to whether or not -- if we get to the Fed's current trajectory, we'll be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from 2023 into 2024. I think that's still relatively uncertain.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas.\nJeremy Sigee : You've covered a lot of ground, so I've just got a couple of specific follow-ups, please. The first one goes back to the cost topic and the headcount increase in this quarter. I just wondered if that's mainly seasonal with new joiners because I think the acquisition impacts were all already in the prior quarter. So I just wondered if it is just seasonality really that's driving that headcount increase and just how you think about that relative to the cost focus that you've been talking about for a couple of quarters now.\nDenis Coleman : Sure. Thank you for that. In terms of a quarter change, a lot of that change is attributable to campus hires based on time of year. Our new classes of starting professionals occurs during the third quarter. We mentioned an intention to slow hiring velocity. We have indeed followed through on that topic and references to strategic growth initiatives. That's to say that slowing down the velocity of hires does not mean that we're not still making hires in the market. We have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the firm. There's a lot of talent inside of Goldman Sachs. There's also talent outside of Goldman Sachs that we can add to our team to continue to strengthen our ability to deliver for clients. So we are focused on overall levels of headcount growth, looking to slow it, but also remaining nimble and strategic with respect to strategic hires.\nJeremy Sigee : Very clear. And then a separate follow-up just on the Wealth Management -- Workplace Wealth Management, which I feel is a sort of -- it's a new thing for you to talk about in such a high-profile way. Do you have all the building blocks that you need to be successful and to grow that space? Or are there bits that you're going to have to build to make a success of that?\nDavid Solomon : So I appreciate the question, Jeremy. I mean this is actually something that we started building decades ago. It started with the acquisition of Ayco. I'm going to get the date wrong, but it was in the early 2000s. I think it was approximately 18 to 20 years ago, which would -- which allowed us to basically affiliate with corporate partners to provide wealth management services and financial counseling to executives that then spread into the organization more broadly than just senior executives. But that business has grown nicely, and that was the building block under which we built this. And today, I think we deal with more than half of the Fortune 100 and hundreds of companies in the Fortune 1000. It's through that platform and then with the addition of United Capital, which was investment we obviously made a few years ago, that gave us a broader high net worth footprint that's allowed us to do more to service more of the clients in the corporations we were partnered with. And then we've added digital solutions that we've been building over the last few years that allow us to reach any member of the team. So we have certain companies that we're partnered with where we're offering financial wellness to hundreds of thousands of employees, which ultimately can become wealth clients or depositors or come on to our platform more broadly. So the building blocks are in place. They've been put in place over a long period of time. And over the last couple of years, we've started to execute much more directly across that. And you're right, now we're amplifying what we've invested in there and trying to highlight that and make sure that some of the other pieces that we've built are aligned with that so we can strengthen it and grow it. But we think it's a big opportunity for the firm.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Mayo : I guess the word for the quarter is resiliency, if I'm hearing you correctly. And it's really remarkable that you haven't had a big blow up that's come back to hit you or your peers so far. But how are you protecting yourself against, I guess, the likelihood -- there's going to be some third-party problem that could ricocheted back on you. I'm talking about outside of, say, the largest U.S. banks, which have reported now. And then the other thing is the resiliency of the backlog is quite amazing in the face of all this volatility in stock and debt market declines. How long does that last?\nDavid Solomon : So Mike, look, appreciate the question, and it's a good question. And I just start by the fact that the firm has a very, very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management, risk mitigation and trying to look around corners and think about what's coming. So I've tried in a number of questions today to highlight that I think things are uncertain, that we're being cautious. I think we've taken a number of actions inside the firm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about our RWA allocation, as we think about things that we're doing to try to operate as let's be prepared for a more difficult environment. Now obviously, we have exposure to that because we're a large financial firm. So you can't 100% protect yourself from that. But there is no question that we're trying to take actions to make sure we're well positioned. I think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buffer during the quarter. I think that's reflective of a conscious decision in this environment to ran a little bit more cautiously, a little bit more conservatively. We've been watching what's been going on in markets across the UK And when we see things like that, we reflect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be amplified. And so we're extremely focused on issues like that. And I would just say that I think the world is fragile at the moment, and it's uncertain. And we're operating through that lens. We're big financial institutions. So we have exposure. If there were -- if there was bigger volatility or bigger problems, we could potentially have exposure to them. But on the other hand, I think that we've got a very broad global deep franchise. And we're well capitalized, and we're very focused on this. And we're going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis, whatever the world throws at us, we'll serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: Yes. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today, and thank you for all the questions. If you have any additional questions that come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. Global economy continues to face significant headwinds. Inflation remains high. Central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in decades. Meanwhile, equity markets are well off the recent highs. Geopolitical instability and energy shocks are an ongoing concern and GDP growth expectations are declining. Many of these trends accelerated towards the end of the quarter. For example, while our own financial conditions index has indicated steady tightening all year, we saw a sharp increase in the index starting in mid-August. Everywhere I go, macro themes dominate. My conversations with CEOs, they tell me that they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans. As we head into the fourth quarter, my sense is that the outlook will remain unsettled, though economic performance will vary by region. I also expect volatility to persist as markets continue to digest these factors. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased that Goldman Sachs delivered solid results during third quarter. As I've said before, the breadth and strength of our global franchise is a key differentiator for us and client engagement remains strong. For the quarter we generated net revenues of $12 billion, earnings per share of $8.25, return on equity of 11% and a return on tangible equity of 12%.  Before handing it over to Denis to review the quarterly results in detail, I would like to spend a moment on our strategic evolution. Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. Four years ago, we set out to enhance our client engagement efforts with a goal of further strengthening our world-class client franchise. Our One Goldman Sachs philosophy was born out of that endeavor, starting with a 30 client pilot, evolving to what has now become the operating ethos of the firm. One Goldman Sachs has been successful well beyond our expectations, proving that the strength and breadth of our global client relationships are key drivers of the execution of our strategy and continued outperformance. These efforts have produced leading share gains, particularly in our core businesses, and have resulted in a 40% book value per share growth since our Investor Day in 2020.  The execution of One Goldman Sachs over the last four years has amplified two foundational elements of our firm. First, the relationship and advisory mindset that underlies our Investment Banking franchise translates exceptionally well across client engagement more broadly. Second, the increasingly symbiotic nature of our businesses creates a virtuous ecosystem that results in a significant multiplier effect and drives market share. Because of this, we're making a series of organizational changes in the fourth quarter to take the next step in the evolution of our strategy. Changes will further strengthen our core businesses, accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efficiency.  As you can see on Page 3, we are integrating our Asset and Wealth Management businesses, as well as our Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses into two important segments of the firm. We will also create a new segment called Platform Solutions that will consolidate our fintech platforms from across the firm, including Transaction Banking, Consumer Partnerships, and GreenSky. This segment will enhance our focus on building platforms that deliver digital financial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. We will further integrate our direct-to-consumer activities into Wealth Management given the growing convergence of Wealth and Consumer banking. We will report our full year 2022 earnings using these three segments and will also host an Investor Day on February 28, 2023. We look forward to reviewing the details of our forward strategy across the businesses, although we will tell you now that our fundamental strategy remains the same and we will be maintaining our principal financial targets. We are excited about the role that Asset and Wealth Management will play in our forward growth plans. Across Asset and Wealth Management, we are operating a fully scaled and integrated franchise providing advice, solutions and execution for institutions and individuals across both public and private markets. Running these businesses together will allow us to holistically drive towards our $10 billion and $2 billion management fee targets. Our investment selection and performance for our clients has supported strong momentum, particularly in alternatives and Wealth Management.  We also believe that reaching and serving employees in their workplace is a significant growth opportunity for Goldman Sachs. Through our strengthening capabilities in Workplace and Personal Wealth, we can now address all the employees at the companies we serve. This expanded offering is a direct response to a clear push from C-Suite leaders for more democratized suite of advice and solutions. It's also clear that these clients prefer an integrated wealth management and banking offering, which presents us with a tremendous opportunity to connect with millions of clients through their workplace. Over the past few years, Global Markets and Investment Banking have been increasingly operating as a unified, leading, world-class franchise. We are the advisor of choice supported by a #1 league table positions across M&A and ECM, and we continue to bolster our leading position as a market maker and risk intermediary for our clients in markets across the globe.  As the world has gotten more complex and our clients' demands have evolved, we are seeing that more and more of them are partnering with both Global Markets and Investment Banking to meet their needs. Synergies across these businesses from advice, financing, risk distribution and hedging allows us to deliver differentiated solutions to our clients. This creates a significant multiplier effect and has helped us drive market share gains across the franchise in recent years. Running these businesses together will enable us to maximize our wallet share. Turning to Page 4. Platform Solutions is an end-to-end primarily cloud-based technology platform business that embeds our best-in-class financial products and services into our clients' ecosystems to serve them and their clients and customers. In recent years, we saw opportunity to leverage our preeminent corporate franchise, world-class risk management and innovative culture to build modern digital products and in the process, diversify our revenues and funding mix. We have built and launched a Transaction Banking platform, a digital Consumer Banking platform, the largest piece of which is credit card and we acquired GreenSky. These platforms have led to partnerships with a number of our clients such as Apple, General Motors, Stripe, American Express and Fiserv. Through our relationships with Apple and General Motors, we already have the ability to access more than 100 million individuals in the U.S. Combination of our brand in Apple is unique as proven by the reaction to Apple Card, which has been ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for two consecutive years by J.D. Power. We have also extended our partnership to new products. This last week, we introduced a new Goldman Sachs savings account for Apple Card that allows users to grow their rewards in a high yield savings account and to add funds to a linked banking account or directly from Apple Cash. This embeds a high yield savings account from Goldman Sachs directly into the Apple Card experience in Apple Wallet. Goldman Sachs and Apple are committed to expanding our relationship, and we have recently extended and adjusted our partnership through the end of the decade in order to continue to help consumers with healthier financial lives. In Transaction Banking, we are delivering a differentiated developer-centric cloud-based product that allows for seamless integration into our clients' ecosystems. We are extremely encouraged by the client feedback and adoption rate of the offering. We now have approximately 425 active clients, with greater than $70 billion in deposits globally as we leverage our corporate franchise to become the partner of choice in the payments arena. Our priority in Platform Solutions for the next few years is to continue to diversify Goldman Sachs revenue and funding while driving profitability. We will look forward to talking to you more about this segment at our Investor Day in February. Let me now address some additional details on our Consumer business. Since 2016, we've made a significant investment. And on Page 5, you can see what we've achieved as a result. We serve over 15 million customers and generated more than $2.2 billion in revenues in the last 12 months. We've learned a lot in the six years since launching the deposit business, and this is shaping our execution priorities as we move forward. Turning to Page 6. For our direct-to-consumer strategy, we will focus on existing deposit customers and consumers that we already have access to through channels like Workplace and Personal Wealth rather than seeking to acquire customers on a mass scale. The purposeful change that will allow us to rationalize spend on future builds and customer acquisition costs. In Workplace and Personal Wealth alone, we already have the ability to reach over 9 million individuals. Our Marcus deposit customers remain core to our broader efforts. We will continue to grow the deposit offering and the level of service that has generated over [$110 billion] of retail deposits. We believe that all of our customers across all products will benefit from this reprioritization. Before I turn it over to Denis to go through the results for the quarter, I want to highlight the following. Over the last four years, this leadership team has been working hard to grow, diversify and strengthen Goldman Sachs. Our experience forms this new direction so that we can better serve our clients and amplify our strengths. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey, setting us up to deliver on our targets and unlock shareholder value. Consistent with our strategy, we are focusing on the execution -- we're focusing our execution on 3 key priorities, as you can see on Page 7, which are to grow management fees, maximize wallet share and grow financing activities and scale Platform Solutions to deliver pretax profitability. We'll talk more about this at our Investor Day in February. I will now turn it over to Denis. Sure. So thanks for the question, Glenn. And look, at a high level, the targets remain in place. And our confidence in the targets and our ability to deliver those targets is high, and we're very focused on them. We continue to make progress in the fundraising, and we highlighted it in the context of the script. And we have a series of offerings that are coming over the course of the next 18 months. And while certainly I'd say that private equity fundraising environment is more constrained and the alternative fundraising environment is broadly more constrained, I would highlight just the fact that we have a very, very broad franchise, a very, very diverse sense of offering at -- sets of offerings and that there's a lot of opportunity that comes out of an environment like this. And I actually think from a vintage perspective, the opportunity to put money to work in this environment when we look forward and then when we look back, it's probably something that will be very, very attractive. We're obviously shifting the macro environment, as we've talked about. That's going to create headwinds around valuations, and there's been a big reset. On the other hand, if you have dry powder or you have interesting strategies -- you highlighted some. I think lending strategies will be quite attractive in this environment. I think there's good institutional capital and, candidly, good capital out of the wealth channel still available to support these strategies. So we're taking a long-term approach to growing these businesses. The businesses are growing nicely. We've set targets that we'll continue to meet. And I know that if we have a good broad offering for our clients, that we'll continue to have success in this. And candidly, this is one of the reasons why we're integrating Asset and Wealth Management is as we believe by putting these platforms together, we have the best eye and the best breadth to really understand where the opportunities are to serve our clients and also where the opportunities are for good performance. Thanks for the question, Steven. I'll start at just a high level, and then Denis will go to the details with you in terms of how we're thinking about it. But I do think there are different factors that are leading to the expense growth, but one is there is definitely an inflationary pressure that's affecting certain aspects of the business. We're obviously looking at that and thinking about that carefully. I do think we're making investments across the platform, particularly in certain technology infrastructure, and that's having an impact in the medium-term. We think those are investments that we need to make. At the same point, though, given the environment, we're extremely focused on trying to mitigate any expense growth to the degree we can. Now there are going to be headwinds given the natural inflation that sets in, but why don't I have Denis kind of walk through and break down some of the different components that we've been focused on? Sure. And so first, I just want to amplify, I said in the script, we continue to be committed to our forward targets. And there's nothing about the environment or the way we're running the firm that doesn't lead us to believe that we can deliver on the targets that we would set over the course of the coming years, whether the return target or also the efficiency target that we've set. And we're tracking a number of KPIs and continue to be very focused on that. The realignment of the firm is really driven by our ability to serve clients. That is the most important thing that's coming out of this. And we've been very, very focused on wallet share and client share broadly. We've made real improvements over the last few years, and we think this further aligns those goals and that capability. Now in this realignment, we are making a purposeful shift as we think about our direct-to-consumer business. And I'd just highlight that one of the things that changes by aligning our direct-to-consumer business with our wealth business and people that are on our wealth platform is that the forward spend for customer acquisition is meaningfully lower. And so of course, as you look at that, that's helpful in the overall returns of the firm. But I would highlight that just the numbers, either way we were looking at it are small in the context of businesses, our core businesses, banking and markets, asset and wealth management. And I don't think any of this was having a big impact on our ability to meet our targets or the pace at which we will meet our targets. We do think, and this is why we're doing this, that this is a better way for us to align the business and move the business forward. And so that's why we've made this purposeful shift. But again, I'd just amplify, these are not big numbers in the context of our meeting our targets when you look at the overall performance of the firm. Well, at the moment, we continue to be extremely focused on our businesses and the growth and the things that we have on our plate in front of us. As you know, we made a couple of acquisitions. We're in the process of integrating those acquisitions in. And at the moment, that's where our focus lies. As we go forward in the future, if there are opportunities to accelerate the growth, particularly in Asset and Wealth Management, we'll consider them. But at the moment, we remain very focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing on the things that we have in front of us. Christian, we've been -- it's interesting because I know you follow us closely, and we've been talking about a variety of things in this. If you go back to our investor update at the beginning of the year, we highlighted a lot of the synergies between banking and markets and how we were working to get those client activities more closely aligned. We also highlighted in our update at the beginning of the year the synergies between Asset and Wealth. And then when John spoke at the Bernstein conference in May, we put a big, big spotlight on the synergies we thought bringing Asset Management and Wealth Management closer together. So it's not that by doing this that we're doing something dramatically different. We've been driving the firm in this direction with respect to client service and One GS for a number of years. And we think as we've done that and we've looked at that and we've learned, we think by organizing the firm this way, it makes it easier for investors to understand and see how we look at our client set and how we're operating against that client set. And so we view it as a natural progression that strengthens our ability to deliver for clients. And so that's why we've moved in this direction. That's with the big businesses, banking and markets and Asset and Wealth Management. On Platform Solutions, we have a bunch of these platforms where we're making investments. We think they're very interesting. They're growing. They require more focus. This alignment of them allows us to shine a brighter, more transparent light on them. And we're very committed to driving them to profitability and a meaningful contribution over time. And we think by organizing this way, it allows us to maintain that focus on what is a small piece of the business, but one that I think in the future allows us a differentiated opportunity to serve our corporate and institutional clients. Well, I think, Christian, what -- the steps that we've taken today are reflective of the learnings. And whenever you innovate and you build new platforms and new things, you're always going to be constantly looking and examining what you're doing and saying what have we learned, how can we do this better? I'd say I'm very proud of the team in our Consumer business, the markets team broadly. When I look at the deposit platform that's been built and the growth from zero to over $110 billion of deposits over the last six years, we have 15 million customers on the platform. I think we have a very unique credit card technology that's differentiated. We have a couple of extraordinary partnerships. I think that when you look at all of that together, we have some very good things, but one of the things I think we've learned is that the ability to scale that and attract customers and the direct-to-consumer business needs to be focused in a more directed way. And so we're focusing it by aligning it with our Wealth business where we have access to millions of people. And so I still see a terrific opportunity to take what a really, really interesting digital products and in being aligned with our Wealth business, provide those products and services to clients and customers at Goldman Sachs.  In addition, I think the partnerships that we've built also provide good opportunities for us to serve corporate clients with very, very interesting digital capabilities and allow them to ultimately serve their end customers or clients. And so yes, there have been bumps. Not everything has been perfect. I think that always happens when you're innovating. But I also think we've built meaningful things that create meaningful opportunities for the firm as we go forward. And in particular, our ability to have a more diversified funding base and a big deposit platform that we can grow from here and an ability to offer Wealth customers on our platform a broad array of services, I think, positions us well as we move forward. So there's no -- the first part of your question, Betsy, there's no aspect of the services that we're offering to consumers that we don't continue to offer. The big thing, though, is this alignment that we are aligned with our Wealth business, and that gives us an audience of millions of people that we can focus on with lower customer acquisition costs and their lower forward spend as we grow or add those services to people. With respect to the Apple Card, I made a statement this morning that we extended and amended the partnership with Apple. I just highlighted that it's very unusual for two partners to change one of these partnerships in the middle of a partnership like this. But I think it goes to the fact that it's a very, very strong partnership where there's a lot of opportunity, but because we were doing something innovative with the technology and embedding the technology and Apple's platform, there were different results than we had expected. I mean one of the positive results was very, very good for consumers, if consumers have an ability and, therefore, are more actively paying down their credit card balances more quickly. That led to different modeled results in terms of what kind of balances you'd have with a certain population on the platform. And so in looking at the forward arrangement, the platform has to work for both us and Apple. Apple believe that. We believe that. And so we made changes to make sure that this is attractive for both of us as we move forward and continue to try to deliver really valuable digital financial wellness and access to consumers that are on the platform. So Mike, we're not giving complete transparency on the four-wall look at the Consumer business. It doesn't make money at the moment. I'm not going to go further than that. But what I will say, the deposits are hugely valuable. And we do believe as the platform scales and you stop the pace of growth that we've had, so you're not front-loading reserves the same way, that what we're doing will deliver accretive returns to the firm. And so we continue to feel very, very confident with that. Not everything that's reported is accurate and reflects the journey of innovating and building something like this, but we continue to feel very good about what we've built. We're making some shifts that we think play to our strength and strengthen our ability to accelerate the pace of these tools, this activity contributing to the firm. I'd highlight that the overall performance and the firm -- the firm's overall performance and our targets remain the same. And so again, I know this gets a lot of attention. I understand why it gets a lot of attention, and that's all okay. But we've set targets. We're going to deliver on those targets, and we're going to make investments in things that we think strengthen the firm, and this is one of them. Well, I appreciate that, Mike. And look, it's very generous of you to account 150 years of history, but I just highlight firm looked very different in the 1860s than it looked in the 1920s, than it looked in the 1960s. The firm continues to grow and change. I joined Goldman Sachs in 1999, and it was 23 years ago as a partner, it was a fraction of what Goldman Sachs is today. So we're a big business. We have very big businesses. And of course, our Investment Banking and markets business is core to who we are. It will continue to be core to who we are. It drives our earnings and performance. It drives what we're associated with. . We've built over a number of decades a very, very powerful Asset and Wealth Management business, what we're bringing together today. We're the fifth largest active asset manager in the world, and we think we've got a real opportunity to grow that. I understand now that people accept that as being core to Goldman Sachs. When we started back in the '80s, I don't think people viewed it as core. But we also have 11,000 engineers here, and we're doing some very, very interesting things as the world is changing and the world is evolving with technology. After the financial crisis, the regulatory structure came, and we became a bank. And it was clear we needed deposits and we needed to diversify our funding. And so what Platform Solutions represents is a handful of smaller business opportunities relative to the scale of Goldman Sachs that we're investing in where we think we have a capability to serve our clients. We've, I think, done some very interesting things in Transaction Banking, as we've outlined. I think this card partnership is very, very interesting in terms of what it's allowing us to do. And so we think it's an opportunity. It's still small relative to Goldman Sachs. It's less than 5%, but we think it's an opportunity worth investing into as we continue to broaden the scope and scale of what Goldman Sachs can do for our clients. And that's kind of the way we're thinking about it. But Brennan, just to amplify, we're committed to our efficiency target. It was never meant to be a target that would be hit absolutely in every single year exactly the same way. And so this obviously has been a tougher operating environment, and it's having an impact. But we remain committed to the target and are operating the firm to deliver on that target. Yes. No, Brennan, I appreciate that. There's no question that the aspiration is probably got more communicated in a way that they were broader than where we're now choosing to go. And we are making it clear that we're going back on some of that. Now we have built some things. We have a checking platform. We have an investing platform. And if you are aligning us with wealth and you have wealth customers, wealth customers can use those things, but it's very, very different to have those capabilities and be able to use them on a broad wealth platform versus directly marketing them to independent consumers on mass. And I think one of the big learnings over the last few years is that we're better to play to our strength. And now our focus is -- I think the technology with Gold is very, very good, and we can now connect it to millions of people that are on our platform, and that is a narrowing of the focus for sure. It is a purposeful shift, tried to make that clear in the script. And I think it plays the strength that we have. But we are a bank. We need deposits. We are a wealth platform. People around a wealth platform want an ability to leave money here. Actually, if you look at other wealth platforms, they have banking capabilities attached to them. And so I think we're strengthening our ability as a broad wealth platform. And I want to amplify this workplace wealth channel where we have access to millions of people is a very, very interesting place for us to attach some of the stuff that we've now built. So I think we've made a significant investment. We are narrowing our focus very clearly, but I still think there are opportunities for us. And again, I want to amplify our other businesses are performing. They drive the overall results. This is still small in the overall scheme of Goldman Sachs, but we think that it's additive, and that's why we're trying to focus it and drive it forward in the best way. And I appreciate the comment that shareholders haven't been excited about it. And that certainly affects some of our decision-making. Yes. I would say, Devin, at a high level, we're tightening economic conditions very, very quickly. And when you tighten economic conditions, it has an impact on these things. I think the impact lagged a little bit. I do think there's been a big reset in the capital markets for IPOs, for debt financing. People have to get their minds around the valuations, the cost of capital. I think that reset is occurring. History would tell you that capital markets generally don't stay close no matter what the environment. They don't stay closed for years at a time because people have to move forward. They have to operate their businesses. They have to raise capital. And so they adjust to the new environment. That said, the prospects for economic growth are uncertain in 2023. And so I think there are going to be headwinds. So I expect a more cautious or a bumpier capital markets and M&A environment as we head into 2023. I think we need more clarity on the trajectory of the economy and the trajectory of inflation to really see all that stuff accelerate from the levels it's operating at today. Look, Matt, I think it's always hard to predict. But I think if you want to go back to the period before the pandemic, I do think the level of client activity and a shifting macroeconomic environment has created a larger wallet. I think one of the things that we benefited from, and we continue to try to amplify this, is we've grown our wallet share by over 300 basis points since 2019. So we're benefiting from the fact that the available wallet is larger and has been larger for the last couple of years. But in addition, with 300 basis points of wallet share growth, that's also improved our position. So I do think clients are active. We have a truly global franchise. It's broad. It's deep. We're very, very focused on our market share position with the leading clients. I can't tell you what the future will bring, but I just think that our franchise is extremely well positioned. Whatever that opportunity is, our relative positioning against that opportunity to serve our clients is strong. Well, it's hard to pull it apart. I mean if global peers are pulling back capital and resources that they allocate, the people who are committed to it, the big U.S. players are going to benefit. But I actually think the big thing that has driven our share gains is the fundamental shift in the client philosophy of the firm, the investment in the One Goldman Sachs ethos, I think it's had a material impact on our Global Markets business. And I think it's affected our shares. I think the team in that division has executed in a very, very strong way against that. It's improved our client relationships, improved our positioning materially with the top 100 clients. I know you know that we set out a few years ago and said we were 40 -- we had 44 of the top 100 that we were in the top 3 with. We're now in the top 3 with over 75. That's been a very coherent -- very focused effort to improve our client positioning. I think that's had the biggest impact on our market shares. I don't think it's simple for sure, Gerard. I think it's still pretty uncertain. I do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inflation and, therefore, understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward. The Fed is executing and has sent some very, very clear goals as to where they're going to the tightening cycle in the near term, but I think there's uncertainty whether or not that will get inflation to a place where the policy will shift going forward. And so I think we're in an uncertain period. I think that this warrants, and we're operating the firm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward. But we'll have to watch closely. But I don't have a clear answer for you as to whether or not -- if we get to the Fed's current trajectory, we'll be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from 2023 into 2024. I think that's still relatively uncertain. So I appreciate the question, Jeremy. I mean this is actually something that we started building decades ago. It started with the acquisition of Ayco. I'm going to get the date wrong, but it was in the early 2000s. I think it was approximately 18 to 20 years ago, which would -- which allowed us to basically affiliate with corporate partners to provide wealth management services and financial counseling to executives that then spread into the organization more broadly than just senior executives. But that business has grown nicely, and that was the building block under which we built this. And today, I think we deal with more than half of the Fortune 100 and hundreds of companies in the Fortune 1000. It's through that platform and then with the addition of United Capital, which was investment we obviously made a few years ago, that gave us a broader high net worth footprint that's allowed us to do more to service more of the clients in the corporations we were partnered with. And then we've added digital solutions that we've been building over the last few years that allow us to reach any member of the team. So we have certain companies that we're partnered with where we're offering financial wellness to hundreds of thousands of employees, which ultimately can become wealth clients or depositors or come on to our platform more broadly. So the building blocks are in place. They've been put in place over a long period of time. And over the last couple of years, we've started to execute much more directly across that. And you're right, now we're amplifying what we've invested in there and trying to highlight that and make sure that some of the other pieces that we've built are aligned with that so we can strengthen it and grow it. But we think it's a big opportunity for the firm. So Mike, look, appreciate the question, and it's a good question. And I just start by the fact that the firm has a very, very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management, risk mitigation and trying to look around corners and think about what's coming. So I've tried in a number of questions today to highlight that I think things are uncertain, that we're being cautious. I think we've taken a number of actions inside the firm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about our RWA allocation, as we think about things that we're doing to try to operate as let's be prepared for a more difficult environment. Now obviously, we have exposure to that because we're a large financial firm. So you can't 100% protect yourself from that. But there is no question that we're trying to take actions to make sure we're well positioned. I think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buffer during the quarter. I think that's reflective of a conscious decision in this environment to ran a little bit more cautiously, a little bit more conservatively. We've been watching what's been going on in markets across the UK And when we see things like that, we reflect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be amplified. And so we're extremely focused on issues like that. And I would just say that I think the world is fragile at the moment, and it's uncertain. And we're operating through that lens. We're big financial institutions. So we have exposure. If there were -- if there was bigger volatility or bigger problems, we could potentially have exposure to them. But on the other hand, I think that we've got a very broad global deep franchise. And we're well capitalized, and we're very focused on this. And we're going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis, whatever the world throws at us, we'll serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders."

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 8 of the presentation. As David mentioned, we generated earnings per share for the third quarter of $8.25. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered a return on common equity of 12.2% and a return on tangible equity of 13.1%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 9. Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.6 billion, down 57% versus a very strong quarter a year ago. Financial advisory revenues were $972 million, down 41% versus record performance in the third quarter last year. Despite lower volumes, we maintained our #1 league table position year-to-date and expanded our lead. Equity underwriting net revenues were $241 million, reflecting limited industry-wide activity. Nonetheless, we continue to rank #1 year-to-date in equity and equity-related offerings. Debt underwriting net revenues were $328 million, given muted issuance volumes across both high yield and investment grade.  While activity remained slow this quarter, our backlog is robust, particularly in advisory and equity underwriting. Our advisory dialogues continue to be strong, though clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of certain deal and financing-related activity. Corporate lending generated net revenues of $35 million as solid performance in middle market lending and Transaction Banking was largely offset by headwinds on certain hedges in our portfolio and marks in leverage lending. Moving to Global Markets on Page 10. Segment net revenues were $6.2 billion in the quarter, up 11% year-on-year, as client engagement and activity remains strong. Financing activities continued to demonstrate stable growth, comprising approximately 30% of the total revenues in this segment. Turning now with FICC on Page 11. Revenues were $3.5 billion in the third quarter, 41% higher than the third quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $2.8 billion, up 40% year-over-year. We saw strength across our rates, currencies and commodities franchises amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and volatility. In FICC financing, we generated a 41% increase in revenues driven by increased opportunities across repo and mortgage lending. We remain focused on growing this business in support of our clients' financing needs. Our FICC lending portfolio is conservatively underwritten and well collateralized. Moving to Equities. Net revenues in the third quarter were $2.7 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 19% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment and lower client activity. In Equities financing, we generated near-record revenues of $1.1 billion as we supported client financing activities despite lower prime balances. Moving to Asset Management on Page 12. Asset Management net revenues were $1.8 billion. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, roughly flat relative to last quarter and up 42% year-over-year, reflecting management fees from NNIP and the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds. Equity investments generated revenues of $527 million in the third quarter. More specifically, our public equity portfolio produced approximately $215 million of revenues primarily driven by gains on two investments. Across our private portfolio, we generated approximately $310 million of net revenues. We saw event-driven gains of over $350 million for various positions in our portfolio and operating revenues of roughly $150 million from our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially offset by approximately $200 million of marks driven by several investments in the consumer and TMT sectors. Given current market conditions, our harvesting of on-balance sheet investments was limited in the third quarter, but we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. We continue to make progress on our fundraising targets, securing $12 billion of alternative commitments this quarter. We also closed West Street Capital Partners VIII, our flagship private equity fund, which at $9.7 billion was significantly above its original target. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $231 million, primarily reflecting net interest income of $267 million. I'll now turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on Page 14. We produced record net revenues of $2.4 billion in the third quarter, up 18% versus a year ago, driven by significantly higher net revenues in Consumer Banking. For the quarter, despite the market headwinds, management and other fees of $1.2 billion were relatively flat sequentially as net market depreciation was largely offset by strong client net inflows. Private banking and lending net revenues reached a record of $395 million, up 35% year-over-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $744 million in the third quarter, nearly double the third quarter of 2021, reflecting higher credit card balances and improved deposit spreads. Moving on to Page 15. Total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion. Combined firm-wide management and other fees in the third quarter rose 15% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. On Page 16, total firm-wide net interest income of $2 billion in the third quarter was up 18% relative to the second quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $177 billion, up slightly versus the second quarter as growth in credit cards and Wealth Management loans was offset by a decrease in real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses was $515 million, primarily driven by growth in our consumer lending portfolio, net charge-offs and worsening economic indicators, particularly in Europe. The credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient as reflected by minimal net impairments in the quarter. On the Consumer side, though we are seeing some signs of credit deterioration and an increase in charge-offs, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations. That said, we're closely monitoring the portfolio and actively using our underwriting in light of the softening macroeconomic outlook. Let's turn to expenses on Page 17. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion. Our compensation ratio year-to-date net of provisions was 32.5%. Through the third quarter, our compensation and benefits expenses are down over 20% relative to 2021. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by ongoing integration and run rate expenses related to the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions, $191 million in litigation reserves and higher transaction-based expenses. We remain highly focused on operating efficiency. As we've previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts, and we expect that these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time. Turning to capital on Slide 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially and representing a 100 basis point buffer to our current capital requirement. In the third quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and common stock dividends of $893 million. As a reminder, our GSIB surcharge will increase by 50 basis points in January 2023, bringing our CET1 ratio requirement to 13.8%. We will continue to target a buffer of 50 basis points to 100 basis points above this requirement. In conclusion, our solid third quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We are mindful of the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, and we will prudently manage our resources and maintain a risk-sensitive orientation as we continue to serve our clients. I share David's enthusiasm of the opportunities ahead of us. The further alignment of our businesses will help drive the organization forward. Successful execution of our strategic priorities, growing management fees, maximizing wallet share and scaling platform solutions will further strengthen the firm and unlock shareholder value. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. And Glenn, I can add from an alternatives perspective, we mentioned growth of $12 billion in new commitments in the quarter. That brings year-to-date to $57 billion, just shy of $60 billion. We now sit at $164 billion towards our increased $225 billion target. We continue to migrate our alternatives into AUS that sits now at $256 billion of alternatives AUS. So despite the environment, we continue to make progress towards our fundraising goals, particularly in alternatives. Glenn, thank you -- thanks for the question on RWA. As you note, our RWAs were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We have been focused on managing our RWA footprint tightly. Within that number, you'll see reductions in terms of market-based RWAs and increases in credit RWAs. And we're being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy RWA capacity to drive efficiencies as well as scale franchise growth activities. And FICC financing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our RWA deployment. And so that's one of the reasons why you see the ongoing focus in the growth of the FICC financing line. Sure. So if we take a step back, we look at our overall level of operating expenses year-to-date, they're down 6% compared to the prior year-to-date period. They are up 1% sequentially, drivers obviously across both comp and non-comp. If you look at the non-compensation growth over the course of the last year, roughly half of that is attributable to expenses associated with the integration and run rate of NNIP and GreenSky together with change in litigation. So that is representing about half. On the balance, as David indicated, we do see some impact from inflation. We do see the impact of higher levels of transaction-based expenses, but we are also taking actions to reduce expenses within the overall non-compensation category where we can. You may note that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we reduced our professional fees, something that we indicated in our previous earnings release. And we're going to continue to think very, very disciplined about the way in which we deploy non-compensation expenditures striking the balance of driving towards our efficiency ratio but as well as making the investments that we think are appropriate to continue to strengthen and grow the firm. Sure. Thank you, Steven. Let me cover that in a bit of detail for you. So obviously, on the $527 million equity line, there's a number of components. As we mentioned previously, we have a public equity portfolio, and that contributed positively north of $200 million for the third quarter. And then also within the private portfolio, you have a number of things that are going on within our private equity portfolio. We have roughly $0.5 billion of event-driven gains that came through over the course of the third quarter, whether those be capital raising activities, strategic transactions or the operating expenses from our CIEs, those positive gains were offset by markdowns in our private equity portfolio, particularly in TMT and Consumer. Betsy, it's Denis. Thanks for that question. Our position is, we remain focused on targeting the 3% GSIB, same message we gave at the end of the second quarter. We're one quarter closer to the end of the year. We are on track to achieve the 3% GSIB level. As we indicated in the second quarter, I would reiterate now that should the opportunity set with clients or the market generally change, we could pivot away from that. But from where we sit right now today, looking into year-end, we remain focused on the 3% GSIB. Brennan, I'll take that for you. Thanks for the question. As David indicated earlier, we remain very committed to our firm-wide targets, and we're going to look to achieve them over the medium term. The efficiency ratio is one of those. We will not necessarily hit that target each and every year. This is probably one of those years. It's not been a top quartile environment for performance. But that being said, we are pulling the levers that we can pull. You'll note that our compensation and benefits on a year-to-date basis is down 21%. And we're going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay per performance orientation but also with respect to our targets. And finally, remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight, and our talent is important to our franchise. But you can see the movement we're making in our compensation year-to-date as a component of the overall efficiency ratio. And then on the non-compensation side, that remains very much a focus, and we will look to continue to make progress on non-comp with the goal of driving towards the efficiency target. Sure. Thank you for that question. So maybe just some observations across deposit flows across the firm given the changing environment. On the consumer side of the equation, continuing to perform and outperform our expectations. Our focus is on continuing to attract deposits. We are deliberately positioning ourselves within the competitive envelope. And so -- in such a fashion that we can attract deposits. We do not intend to be the price leader, but we do intend to remain competitive. It's obviously an entirely digital offering. We're not burdened with a lot of other cost and infrastructure. And so we have some flexibility to position our pricing in such a manner that we can attract deposits to continue to grow the firm. Obviously, this is something that will change over the entirety of the cycle. But thus far, it's outperforming our own expectations. On the other hand, institutional activity through Transaction Banking, we're observing that, that is more competitive. There is -- there are more deposits that people are seeking to raise through those channels, being more disciplined. And so we do see more competition for raising deposits through that channel relative to the consumer channel. So thank you for acknowledging that. Obviously, on top of that, our overall growth in management and other fees add up 15% year-over-year; in the last quarter, had almost $2.25 billion. We're well on our way to both our $10 billion total and $2 billion alternative fee targets. And the reality of attracting these types of flows over this period in time, a lot of that has to do with work and performance and track record that has been done previously. Some of these particular flows have longer lead times. Other, shorter lead times. But looking at both the alternative commitments that we were able to secure in the quarter, looking at the change to our alternatives U.S. on the quarter, which was very strong, and then looking at our inflows across the more traditional channels, we are very pleased with the activity that we saw in that regard over the course of the third quarter. And we're very focused on continuing to drive that going forward. Sure. Thank you. I mean, obviously, for the firm overall, loan growth was just about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. But we do continue to see good opportunities, particularly across the Wealth Management segment. You saw better growth in that segment. It's a high-quality lending opportunity for us. And we're leveraging an existing set of relationships in existing franchise that's very much in place. We've obviously been recognized for our advice and solution-oriented way in serving those clients, but we are finding that increasingly, they're looking for us also to provide financing to them. And so we're making sure that we're very focused on supporting them as holistically as possible. And we see good opportunities on the floor to continue to grow those types of financing activities. So thank you, Gerard. It's Denis. So I think as indicated in some of the previous comments and outlined at that original Investor Day, we are very focused on diversifying the funding mix, also benefiting from the pricing and the stickiness of that channel. We've developed, since that period of time, multiple deposit funding channels. The digital markets platform is one of them. Transaction Banking is another. In terms of that original goal of changing the mix, we have achieved that. We continue to be very, very focused on moving that mix. You'll see on a quarter-over-quarter basis that we have improved our deposits, reduced our other unsecured funding. So we remain focused on that. It's an attractive source of funding for us. It also fits within the overall strategic realignment that we've been discussing. Sure. Thank you for that. In terms of a quarter change, a lot of that change is attributable to campus hires based on time of year. Our new classes of starting professionals occurs during the third quarter. We mentioned an intention to slow hiring velocity. We have indeed followed through on that topic and references to strategic growth initiatives. That's to say that slowing down the velocity of hires does not mean that we're not still making hires in the market. We have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the firm. There's a lot of talent inside of Goldman Sachs. There's also talent outside of Goldman Sachs that we can add to our team to continue to strengthen our ability to deliver for clients. So we are focused on overall levels of headcount growth, looking to slow it, but also remaining nimble and strategic with respect to strategic hires."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 18, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us. I am pleased with our performance this quarter. There is no question that the market environment has gotten more complicated and a combination of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitics is having a material impact on asset prices, market activity and confidence. We see inflation deeply entrenched in the economy. And what\u2019s unusual about this particular period is that both demand and supply are being affected by exogenous events, namely the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chains. Our economist, meanwhile, say there are signs that inflation will move lower in the second half of the year. The answer is uncertain and we will all be watching it very closely. Given all of this, we are seeing shifts in monetary policy and those shifts will continue to tighten economic conditions. I expect there is going to be more volatility and there is going to be more uncertainty. And in light of the current environment, we will manage all our resources cautiously and dynamically. Our risk management culture and capabilities should help us navigate this environment for our clients and for the firm. That said, there is nothing about this environment that changes our strategy and we are committed to our medium-term targets. We have a strong client franchise and we remain focused on providing differentiated service. We benefit from the diversity of our businesses and their global footprint. In light of the environment, we are certainly taking deliberate action on capital and expenses, but we will also continue to invest to strengthen and grow our firm. Let me now turn to our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $11.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $7.73 and an ROE of 10.6% and an ROTE of 11.4%. Our book value per share finished the quarter at $302, up 14% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. In Investment Banking, we remain the number one adviser in M&A and equity capital markets. And though capital markets activity has declined, our client dialogue and engagement continues to be strong. This quarter again reaffirmed our strategy to be global, broad and deep in our leading global markets franchise. Each week, clients turn to us for our market expertise and execution in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates the diversification of our businesses across this segment. I am very proud of the fact that we have consistently executed on our strategy to improve our market share as we help our clients manage risk and meet their financing needs. In this environment, our on-balance sheet investments faced significant headwinds after achieving record high net revenues in 2021. Our management and other fees were resilient as we remain focused on growing fee-based revenue streams across our asset management and wealth management segments and further reducing our on-balance sheet investments as markets allow. And in consumer, we are prudently expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both organically and through partnerships. Before turning it over to Denis, let me spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. I was glad to see the improvement in our stress capital buffer, especially because the test this year was more challenging than in the past. This is a reflection of the progress we are making in our strategic evolution. That said we will advance our efforts to improve the capital density of our businesses in order to reduce our capital requirements over time. Following the stress test results, our Board of Directors also declared a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share. This follows an increase of 60% in 2021 and over 50% in 2019. In addition, with regard to our GSIB buffer, while we made a conscious decision to grow our balance sheet to support client activity over the last 3 years, it is our current plan to target a 3% GSIB surcharge. This intention is driven by the recent operating environment as well as client needs. Should these change, we will naturally reevaluate. In closing, I remain confident in our ability to navigate the market environment, serve our clients and create long-term value for shareholders. Despite the uncertainty we face, we continue to drive this organization forward by executing our client-oriented strategy and delivering accretive returns consistent with our targets over time. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let\u2019s start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.9 billion and net earnings of $2.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $7.73. We reposted a return on common equity of 10.6% and return on tangible equity of 11.4%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1 billion, down 41% versus a year ago. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion. Our global M&A franchise remained strong as we closed over 115 deals for approximately $380 billion of deal volume in the quarter, further strengthening our number one league table position. Equity underwriting net revenues were $131 million. Industry volumes remain muted given the ongoing market volatility. Despite this, we remain ready to deliver for our clients once the market backdrop for equity issuance improves. Debt underwriting net revenues were $457 million, where we saw lower levels of market activity amid sharp rate increases in the quarter. While our Investment Banking backlog is down from the peak levels last year, it is still higher than it has been at any point in our history prior to 2021. We feel good about the quality of our backlog based on our healthy levels of strategic dialogue that span from technology and innovation to defensive repositioning of client portfolios, but we may see some softening if the challenging market environment persists. Revenues from corporate lending were $352 million, up 121% versus a year ago driven by hedge gains associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately $225 million in marks on certain commitments from our acquisition financing activities. We saw continued growth in our Transaction Banking business. The platform now serves nearly 400 clients and has roughly $65 billion in deposits at the end of the second quarter, generating approximately $175 million in revenues year-to-date. Moving to Global Markets on Page 4, segment net revenues were $6.5 billion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity as we facilitated risk intermediation for clients amid a volatile market. Looking at FICC on Page 5, revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter. In FICC intermediation, we saw a 50% increase in revenues with 3 of our 5 FICC intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the strength and breadth of our diversified franchise. Our macro franchise remained incredibly active as we help clients navigate rising rates, tightening monetary policies and continued volatility across commodities. This drove strong growth in net revenues in rates, commodities and currencies. And while revenues were lower year-on-year in credit and mortgages, clients remain engaged. Meanwhile, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity, which helped delivered record results. Moving to equities, net revenues in the second quarter were a solid $2.9 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 2% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment. Activity was also impacted by lower levels of primary issuance volumes. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose 38% versus a year ago and 14% versus the first quarter. Increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for various forms of financing from our clients. Growth in equities financing, coupled with record performance in FICC financing, is a reflection of our strategy to grow client financing activities, which represented nearly 30% of our overall Global Markets revenues this quarter. Moving to Asset Management on Page 6. Asset Management net revenues of $1.1 billion were materially lower than the second quarter of last year. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by net losses from our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, up 39% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of $305 billion of incremental AUS from the recently completed acquisition of NNIP, which contributed roughly $170 million of management and other fees this quarter. Equity investments generated losses of $221 million, driven by sharp market declines during the quarter. More specifically, on our public equity portfolio, we experienced roughly $660 million of net losses, reducing the value of the portfolio to approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end. In our private portfolio, we produced approximately $440 million of net revenues. We generated event-driven gains of over $380 million from various positions across the portfolio. Additionally, we had operating revenues of approximately $165 million related to our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially offset by approximately $100 million of marks, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. We remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more third-party funds. And in the second quarter, we raised over $20 billion of commitments. We also harvested over $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments. The pace of our realizations this quarter was influenced by both macro and micro drivers with persistent volatility in equity markets, making it more difficult to harvest assets. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $137 million, down 78% versus a year ago as net interest income of $275 million was partly offset by mark-to-market losses of approximately $140 million due to spread widening. I will turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on Page 9. We produced record net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, up 25% versus a year ago, driven by higher net revenues in both Wealth Management and Consumer Banking. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $1.2 billion rose 10% versus last year, driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision. While private banking and lending net revenues of $320 million were down relative to record results last quarter, revenues were up 23% year-on-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer banking revenues were $608 million in the second quarter, rising 67% versus last year and 26% versus the first quarter. Now moving to Page 10. Total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion. Combined firm-wide management and other fees in the second quarter rose 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. We expect our fee revenues to continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this year. On Page 11, total firm-wide net interest income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to the first quarter due to lower net interest income in Global Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $176 billion, up $10 billion versus the first quarter primarily due to growth in corporate, wealth management and residential real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $667 million, up from $561 million in the first quarter. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled losses due to economic indicators worsening quarter-over-quarter. Overall, our portfolio fundamentals remain strong as reflected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book. On the consumer side, while we do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration, we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking mitigating actions as appropriate. Now, let\u2019s turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by integration and run-rate expenses related to the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions as well as continued investments, particularly in technology, and higher levels of business activity. Together, NNIP and GreenSky contributed approximately $200 million to non-compensation expenses this quarter. Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources. As a result, we are taking a number of actions to improve our operating efficiency. Specifically, we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward, though these actions will take some time to be reflected in our results. We are keeping in mind, however, that while we are being disciplined about our expenses, we are not doing so to the detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy. Turning to capital on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach, down 20 basis points sequentially and representing an 80 basis point buffer to our current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year. This past quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of over $700 million. As David noted earlier, in the third quarter, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share. Looking ahead, we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. While we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive, we are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price. In conclusion, our solid second quarter results reflect our ability to navigate volatile markets, while actively supporting our clients. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which will help us serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets. And we are committed to executing on our growth strategy and delivering for our shareholders. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, thanks very much. I apologize if I missed it within your remarks, but can you tell us what the P&L contribution from the $1 billion or so in dispositions out of the private equity book was? And I want to ask that in the context of when people see the marks on the private portfolio being pretty small relative to what happened in the public markets that they want to see why you have confidence, what about the portfolio gives you such confidence that it wasn\u2019t as affected by what\u2019s going on in the public markets? Thanks so much.\nDenis Coleman: Thanks, Glenn. It\u2019s Denis. Let me take that for you. So, we made a number of remarks with respect to the composition of our on-balance sheet equity investments. And specifically, we made note of event-driven gains of approximately $380 million during the quarter. We noted a markdown of $100 million approximately across consumer and technology sectors. And what I would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on a very, very granular basis. It\u2019s comprised of both corporate and real estate assets. And we look at the performance, for example, of our private equity names, their top line performance. On average, they are growing north of 20%. And if we were to take a look at some public comparable, albeit an imperfect one, those are growing in a negative fashion. And so it reflects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of those particular businesses.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. Very much appreciated. And then one quick follow-up, obviously, ECM and DCM pipelines are down a lot given what we have seen. But you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up. I wonder if you could expand on that a little bit, because we haven\u2019t seen a lot of activity these days in M&A? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: What I would say in terms of the overall advisory performance, you can see the headline number, which is quite significant at $1.2 billion. And we have our sustained number one market share position across both announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors. I think this is an environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on what\u2019s particularly strategic for them. The nature of the transactions that they maybe considering could very well be different in their complexion than a year ago, but nevertheless, our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them navigate the market. So, we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement. There is no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if confidence were impaired, we could see some softening even in our advisory activities. But to-date, they have been strong. On the underwriting side, that\u2019s much more a reflection of the current capital markets\u2019 receptivity, and again, strong levels of client engagement. We like our backlog, but it is \u2013 there will be a better market environment required in order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that backlog.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks, Denis.\nDenis Coleman: Thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, David and Denis. So, you posted pretty strong results this morning. You are continuing to take market share in trading. ROE year-to-date is 13%, just pretty good given the backdrop for me and you guys\u2019 tone sounds very, very cautious. So what exactly are you worried about in the macro backdrop, maybe just more specifically? And how does that impact your thinking on timeline to achieve medium-term ROE targets?\nDavid Solomon: I will start, Christian. I don\u2019t know if Denis will add anything to it. I think our tone is cautious, because the environment is uncertain. The environment is very uncertain. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inflationary environment that exists, but there is no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inflation. And as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate confidence and also consumer activity in the economy. I think it\u2019s hard to gauge exactly how that will play out. And so I think it\u2019s prudent for us to be cautious. Now that said, I think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader, much more diverse, much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago, and we benefited from that in the context of the quarter. So we feel good about our ability to operate. I would say that, at the moment, while there is a lot of uncertainty, clients are still relatively active. Denis was just talking about M&A activity, and our clients are active. Capital markets activity is obviously down. This is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it\u2019s certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk. So we continue to monitor it, but I think it\u2019s prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious. And if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we\u2019re evaluating things with respect to resources. We\u2019re being flexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. By the way, we don\u2019t know that the environment is going to get worse. The environment might get better, too. So I just think it\u2019s a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense.  Now with respect to our targets, I want to be clear, we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on meeting those targets. And we don\u2019t see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets. I\u2019m not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way. But I would say in what\u2019s been certainly a very difficult first half of the year, if you think about the headwinds we\u2019ve faced in both public equity markets because of the war in Ukraine and the unwind of the business in Russia, etcetera, I think there have been some exogenous events in this first half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward. So we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we will continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them.\nChristian Bolu: Okay, thanks. Maybe switch over to the consumer business. I wanted to get your latest thinking on that business. How is the profitability curve tracking? How are you thinking about that business going into a downturn? And then just strategically, given the pressures on fin-techs out there, I\u2019m wondering if there is any sort of opportunity here to try and grow faster, either organically or inorganically.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I appreciate the question. And I guess I\u2019d just step back and I\u2019d highlight that we\u2019ve been building a business from scratch here. It certainly takes investment, and we\u2019ve been making investment. And we\u2019ve been pretty clear that we have a long-term strategy to create a leading digital platform in the consumer banking business. Now we\u2019ve been at it, as I think you know, for 5 years. We\u2019ve built out a really good deposit platform. We built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology. We have a loans platform. We have some technology around an invest platform, and we\u2019ve also added GreenSky. With that portfolio of product offerings, we\u2019ve told you at our update that we expect greater than $4 billion of revenue in 2024. You can obviously see this quarter that we\u2019re making progress on revenue in the business. And as we noted, I think when we spoke in February, at the update, we said the vast majority of the build cost associated with the products that will achieve that $4 billion target are in the ground. And so I\u2019d remind you of that comment. On a year-to-date basis, the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves as we grow the business. And just a reminder, CECL requires very, very significant upfront reserve build. So we continue to feel good about the progress we\u2019re making, and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to Goldman Sachs over time. And we\u2019re committed to the journey that we\u2019ve set out on to make sure that we do just that over time.\nChristian Bolu: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Solomon: I just \u2013 the one thing I realized, Christian, that I didn\u2019t touch on is we\u2019re very, very focused on the credit box and thinking about the credit box during the early part of the pandemic. When there was enormous uncertainty, we tightened the credit box meaningfully. As Denis highlighted in his opening remarks, we don\u2019t see significant indications of credit deterioration in the consumer. But given tightening economic conditions, we\u2019re watching that very, very carefully. And to the degree that we saw different signals in the short-term, we would adjust our credit box very dynamically.\nChristian Bolu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning, David. Good morning, Denis.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So maybe just as a follow-up on the credit discussion, I was hoping you could speak to your appetite for loan growth. You noted that you could be very dynamic but just given some of the upward pressure on provision from both growth math as well as the macro deterioration. I was hoping you could just provide some ranges as to how we should be thinking about through-the-cycle provision expectation and a more normal operating backdrop?\nDenis Coleman: Steven, thanks. It\u2019s Denis. Let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide some context. So as we noted, with respect to the consumer portion, that\u2019s really driven by ongoing growth in the asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality. And on the wholesale side, we obviously model the macroeconomic outlook. And when we do our work across our various scenarios, over the course of the first quarter into the second quarter, our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables from GDP growth to employment levels to inflation, probability of recession, possibility of stagflation, etcetera. And so we reweighted our scenarios, and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see. We continue to invest in our franchise. We think it\u2019s important to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients, but we will continue to provide appropriately along the way.\nSteven Chubak: Very helpful. And maybe just for my follow-up for David on capital. You did cite plans to manage to the lower GSIB surcharge of 3%, I know that you were on a path to potentially migrating as high as 3.5. I was hoping you could speak to the specific actions you\u2019re taking to mitigate the GSIB score whether we should be contemplating any level of revenue attrition from those actions. And does your ability to manage to that lower GSIB surcharge inform the more aggressive tone that we heard on buyback?\nDavid Solomon: I appreciate the question. And let me try to give some clarity to our thought process. As monetary and fiscal policy were extremely loose and extremely forward, the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very, very rapidly. And the context of that in 2020 and 2021, we saw opportunities to deploy resources, serve our clients and, therefore, expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the profit opportunity for the firm. That environment has certainly shifted in 2022. And while our clients are still active, they are not active to the same degree that they were in 2021. And you can obviously see that in the revenue environment, not just with us but across the street. In stating that we\u2019re focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a 3% level, we are making a forward assumption that\u2019s consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year. I note one of the things that I said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different conclusion. We will obviously evaluate that and change that. But based on the experience we\u2019ve had over the last 6 months, and the revenue opportunity we\u2019re capturing, we think we can continue to capture that revenue opportunity available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation, and that should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments. But I would think at this point in time, looking at that, Denis highlighted in his remarks, with the stock trading where it is, we\u2019re certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning. One of the other areas for capital deployment, obviously, is in growing the consumer business. And I know you\u2019ve got GreenSky into the belt, the General Motors card. Apple\u2019s doing gangbusters. So I just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you\u2019re thinking about other opportunities you might see for either new partnership opportunities or is there balance sheet acquisition capabilities there?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So thanks, Betsy. So look, I think what I\u2019d say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us, given our relationships, our technology, etcetera, that are interested in doing things with us. At the same point, we\u2019ve done a bunch over the course of the last 5 years to build this business. And as we\u2019ve said, we put a couple of big partnerships on the ground in cards. We\u2019ve started an Invest platform. We\u2019re now working to integrate GreenSky. I think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute at a very high level. Certainly, as we get out to 2023 and 2024, we will be more open to other partnerships and other meaningful things going forward. But at the moment, we\u2019re focused on really executing on what we put forward, which included, as we had highlighted, launching checking later in the year.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. Okay. And then separately on transaction banking, you\u2019ve given us a lot of good metrics along the way on how that business has been building out. Maybe you could update those a little bit for us today as well as give us a sense as to how the higher rate environment is impacting your returns there. I would think you\u2019re running ahead of plan based on that or expected to by year-end? And how do you redeploy that fully into that business line or elsewhere? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Hey, Betty, it\u2019s Denis. Maybe I\u2019ll take that one. As you suggest, we feel really good about the transaction banking business, it\u2019s progress year-to-date and the forward. We continue to improve on each of the metrics that we\u2019ve been reporting on, so nearly 400 clients, deposits at around $65 billion revenues year-to-date $175 million. And importantly, we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational. Operational and fully insured deposits are now north of 35% at the end of the second quarter. So we will continue to focus on growing overall clients balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business. It\u2019s obviously a profitable business already. And it\u2019s a business, as David highlighted, that benefits from leveraging the relationships that we have already inside the firm to grow it incrementally.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi, I guess I\u2019m thinking in terms of the trade-offs that you have to make, David, in terms of both capital and expenses. On capital, I mean, you talked about a broader, diverse, resilient, more annuity-like business stream, but then we get the Fed stress test results and you guys finished in last place, albeit better than last year but still last place. So I guess the regulators don\u2019t see it the same way that you do. And the trade-off between managing for lower regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues. And then the other dynamic decision is managing expenses lower. As you said you\u2019re taking a closer look at that, the trade-off between ensuring good profit margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back.\nDavid Solomon: I\u2019m not sure there was a question there. I think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with. I mean I would highlight, while it\u2019s a fair comment that our SCB is higher than everyone else\u2019s because of our current business mix, if that\u2019s what you refer to as last place, I would comment for the stress test we came in first place is that we were the only firm that actually saw their SCB decrease and many institutions saw their SCB increase very meaningfully. Now I don\u2019t take that as a victory lap. We\u2019re early in the journey of taking assets off our balance sheet, but I still do think, Mike, one of the big attributes we have, as you look ahead over the next few years, is we are going to continue to make that business much less RWA dense. And I do think, as indicated by the step forward we took in this stress test, that we will hopefully take other steps forward and future tests as we continue to change that mix. I am not satisfied with where we are on the journey of making the firm more fee-based and more resilient. But I am satisfied that we\u2019ve made meaningful progress. And I think the results this quarter show the diversity of the business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment. And so as someone who\u2019s followed the industry and our firm for quite some time, I think the performance in this environment is reflective of the beginning of that evolution. But you\u2019re exactly right. We have to constantly balance between investing in the future and providing resources to serve clients when they are active and driving those shareholder returns that kind of are \u2013 is our true north of what we\u2019re trying to drive towards. So yes, it\u2019s a balance. I think we\u2019re trying to strike that balance appropriately, and we\u2019re going to continue to be laser-focused on making sure we do as good a job as we can, striking that balance effectively.\nMike Mayo: And on the second part, as it relates to expenses, it sounds like you\u2019re going not quite plan B, but you\u2019re getting ready in case you need a plan B. How long do these deals stay alive before it\u2019s pencils down and they just say, all right, we\u2019re going to wait for the next cycle? I mean, it seems like with every month that passes, the chance that capital markets will rebound close to where it previously was declines. How long do you and the markets have before things just stay lower for longer?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I guess I\u2019d say a couple of things. We always \u2013 I think we\u2019re very nimble allocators of resources, financial resources, human resources. We try to have a very, very flexible, nimble approach. And so of course, we\u2019ve expressed earlier in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we\u2019re going to be cautious. Of course, we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse. With respect to capital markets activity, I think I told you at the beginning of the year in our January call on January 15 that I did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. And I wouldn\u2019t call that as normal. So when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years. I, don\u2019t think we\u2019re going back to that anytime soon. But I do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last 7 years, take a period 5 years, 7 years, and look at average levels, I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters. And history would just tell you that, that doesn\u2019t mean that it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain. But generally speaking, one of the things that affects capital markets activity is people have to reset their mind around valuation. They have to reset their mind around capital costs. And that happens relatively quickly because people have plans. They have commitments. They have to invest. And as soon as they get their minds around that, they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that\u2019s available to them. And so I\u2019d be very surprised if we don\u2019t see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity. Now we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difficult longer. But it\u2019s not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we\u2019re headed to a super negative environment, but it is uncertain. It is a little bumpy, and so we\u2019re going to proceed cautiously.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, David and Denis. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to start on expenses. So you indicated that you\u2019re adjusting the investments, but it sounds more like that\u2019s about slowing the hiring outlook. So maybe the impact there has a lag, and we\u2019re more talking about year-end or even into 2023 and more on the comp side. So curious about, number one, whether that\u2019s a fair interpretation. And then number two, the best way to think about non-comp if we adjust for the legal charge and what \u2013 and maybe some higher BC&E this quarter, is this the right jumping off point for non-comp? Or might some of that expense diligence that you flagged also put some downward pressure on the non-comp line? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So two components to your question. And obviously, we manage the firm to an efficiency ratio, looking at both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation meaning as you would have seen through the first half of the year, we\u2019ve taken compensation expense down significantly, $3.5 billion less comp expense in the first half versus the first half last year. And at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation side of the equation. As we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring, decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year, something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efficiency of our human capital resources, given overall environment. And you\u2019re right, some of that will take time to reflect itself through the P&L. So I think that\u2019s the right expectation. You are correct in anticipating that we\u2019re also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non-compensation expense. Some of them are \u2013 dovetail well with investments that we\u2019re making to grow the firm. And some of those activities will obviously look to continue. We may slow the pace, but we will continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the firm. And there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we actually see the impact of inflation, impacting on the overall level of expense. And so that\u2019s just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efficiency target, which is I think the comments and references that both David and I have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay, great. Thanks for that color, Denis. Appreciate it. And for the second question, I am curious, we have seen \u2013 you talked a lot about M&A and how, obviously, your investment bank franchise is holding up really well. But just sort of a question around the environment and we have seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. So, curious whether or not that\u2019s also what you are seeing and whether or not there is any concern that, that availability, lesser availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers?\nDavid Solomon: I think it\u2019s a good \u2013 I think it\u2019s an appropriate thing to look at carefully. I would say, at the moment, real availability issues are limited to some very, very stressed borrowers or some very, very out-of-favor sectors. But I do think sometimes people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price. And so I would say, at the moment, the bigger thing that\u2019s slowing down capital markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment. Ultimately, companies need to raise capital. They find that new clearing price. But I do think if the environment stays very, very difficult from an economic perspective, there are certain sectors where availability is an issue. And there are a couple of them now. I would point to retail as one where certainly capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully. And so I think we will watch this very cautiously. But again, I would tell you that there is a mindset when you go through this in a resetting that\u2019s going on, and I think ultimately, markets find clearing prices. And capital markets, there is certainly plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices. The most levered companies will have a tougher time in this environment.\nDenis Coleman: I mean another thing I would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity. So, as an example, in our FICC financing business, there are a number of clients who are looking for financing. They have important transactions to execute, attractive assets to have financed. And to the extent that there is less availability of financing across the street, that presents an opportunity for us given the way that we are currently positioned, our focus on financing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning David and Denis. A question on the RIA custody offering, can you just talk a little bit about the evolution of that offering and whether we should expect a more aggressive acceleration in the marketing of that offering in the coming quarters? There has been some recent press suggesting that you guys are better integrating that with the broader Goldman capability. So, I would love to just get an update on your thinking there?\nDavid Solomon: Well, we obviously \u2013 we made an acquisition in the space. It\u2019s something that we are focused on as an opportunity for the firm. But I would say, at this point, the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small. But I think as we look forward over the course of the next 3 years to 5 years, it will be an area that we see opportunity in and we will turn more focus to expanding. That\u2019s why we made this acquisition and we think it\u2019s an interesting opportunity for us.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. Thanks. And then a follow-up here, Denis just touched on this, but we heard a lot about trading client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a number of firms in the industry. It didn\u2019t seem to impact your trading or financing results. But can you give us any sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly? Is there another leg that could exist here or clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading outlook as well?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. I appreciate the question. I mean connecting it back to some of the comments that Dave has made looking back over the course of the last couple of years, we have gone through an extraordinary period. We see an ongoing transition into a new type of market environment. I am sure there are some clients that have looked to de-lever themselves and position for the current operating environment. We continue to see very high levels of client opportunity. There was a lot of engagement in the second quarter particularly in the macro businesses clients approaching us to help them intermediate risk, other clients looking for financing, which is why we had record performance in FICC financing. And I think as we look forward, we are obviously starting the quarter with a buffer to our minimum capital position. We remain very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half. We think there should be some good opportunities and there may be clients that incrementally turned to us to help them navigate the opportunities. So, I think we are \u2013 we feel well set up, and we are optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on the strategic targets, David. So, you said multiple times on the call that you don\u2019t see any reason why Goldman won\u2019t achieve I think your ROTE target 15% to 17% by \u201824. When we think about that, I think when investors struggle with is just the lack of visibility on the revenue side and how quickly you can flex expenses. Just give us a sense of when we think about year-to-date ROTE about 13%, the journey from here to your targets, how much of that is reliant on the macro getting better versus do you think structurally the business can continue to become more profitable without any improvement in the macro?\nDavid Solomon: Well, if we stayed in a macro \u2013 if we stayed in a macro environment, it\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s a good question. I understand where the question comes from. If we stayed in the macro environment, like the first six months of this year for the next 5 years, I think it would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns. Although I do think that we would be more resilient and probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly, by the way, not just Goldman Sachs, if you really have that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment and people would make changes in their businesses on the expense side, etcetera, over time to make sure that they could deliver appropriately for shareholders. I don\u2019t expect \u2013 I think we had a very \u2013 I think this has been a very difficult six months and there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months. I don\u2019t expect to have the same headwinds in the next 6 months or the next 12 months. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that the environment couldn\u2019t be worse or there couldn\u2019t be different headwinds that create different issues. But I think to kind of take what\u2019s going on with some of the exogenous impact over the course of the last six months and translate it as a 3-year or 4-year thing forward, that\u2019s just not our base case. That\u2019s not our base case. And if that was our base case, we would be much more aggressive and forward with respect to expense changes, investments in the business, etcetera, but that\u2019s not our base case. And so we continue to move forward with the base case, where we are pretty confident that we can deliver the level of revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those returns. And I would just highlight that, in the first half of the year, we are not that far off from what we said we need to accomplish over the next 3 years.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. And then just \u2013 and recognizing it\u2019s very challenging to predict trading activity. But when you think about just good volatility versus bad volatility, do you see \u2013 just given all the uncertainty on macros for central bank actions, etcetera, this in terms of fixed trading, things to remain strong as we think about the back half of the year, just whatever is in your crystal ball?\nDavid Solomon: Well, the good volatility, bad volatility has never been an expression that I would like. I think about our business in markets as a business were serving our clients, and we re making sure that we are meeting their needs. That\u2019s why we have been very focused over the last 3 years, 4 years on really improving our approach to our clients, really improving our market share with our clients, adding financing as a capability to our clients, which is much more resilient and therefore, puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there can\u2019t be volatility in the intermediation part of the business. I am not going to make a forecast as to what looks forward, but I think the investments we have made and our client focus and our market shares and our financing business all give those markets businesses more balanced as we go forward. There will be environments where clients are more active and we can capture that and there will be environments where clients are a little bit more quiet, but we are prepared to serve them. And I think if we get out of quarter-to-quarter and continue to look over a 3-year period, there is a very big business that generates very accretive returns and serves our clients well.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nOperator: We will move on to Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Some good details on your loan portfolio and loan loss reserves on Slide 11. And I just wanted to ask specifically on the consumer book, you have got about 13% reserves to loans. Obviously, charge-offs are only 2% and change. But how much of that reserve is kind of factoring in growth seasoning or just a more tough macro environment, how would you frame that?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. I think I would frame it actually as a combination of those factors. So, your seasoning point is fair as well. It\u2019s a less aged portfolio, if you will, than certain other broad-based consumer portfolios. There is an element of seasoning. There is an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to call us \u2013 that that\u2019s the appropriate place to be. You do make reference to charge-offs. Obviously, firm-wide, they are flat quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, down slightly. Consumer is up a little bit. But those are some of the factors that we also take into account and look at.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: And I know earlier you were asked about kind of through the cycle provisioning. And anything specifically on consumer charge-offs as we think about those portfolios, what you would expect once you have the seasoning and what those levels would be, not in a recession, but just more kind of through the cycle?\nDenis Coleman: Yes. I mean I think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation, so whether the impact presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year. The starting point \u2013 the overall health of the consumer is very strong. The credit environment for consumers has been very, very benign. And so I think you need to take stock of sort of where you are starting from. Obviously, if the environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession, then we would expect an increase in that regard.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning. David, in the past couple of years, you guys have focused on reducing your equity portfolio so that the volatility in earnings would be less. Can you share with us where you are in that progress? Are you at a level that you are comfortable with, or you still got some more to go in reducing that portfolio?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I will answer at a very high level, and then I am going to have Denis walk you through some specific details. I am pleased with the progress, but not comfortable with where we are. Comfortable is probably the wrong word. I am pleased with the progress. I would like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress. And I think we are going to do \u2013 we are going to make progress over the course of the coming 12 months, 24 months. Our progress \u2013 we have made a lot of progress. It was slowed also by the fact that went through a period in 2021 where the value of a lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things. But why don\u2019t I have Denis walk you through some high-level numbers that we have put out there?\nDenis Coleman: Yes. So, a couple of things. I think we are \u2013 we are well on our way in terms of the journey. We remain completely committed to the progress and the direction of travel. You will note there were no particular additions over the course of the last quarter. We continued to move down certain of the on-balance sheet equity exposures. We have a detailed asset-by-asset plan that we are executing on. And looking at our results coming through CCAR, Obviously, the Fed recognized our strong PPNR, but we also suspect that the way they concluded the ultimate decision around SCB had something to do with the nature of our on-balance sheet equity investments and the shocks that they choose to apply against that portfolio. And so that\u2019s incremental affirmation that we have selected the right strategy. And then if anything, we should continue to move forward, maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition, remaining mindful of the overall environment and the ability to execute. But I think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing those exposures is completely unchanged.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ECM business. Obviously, according to the Dealogic numbers, the first six months of this year, we all know were very weak and market conditions, we recognize as being the driver. But David, you alluded to maybe the price expectations are coming down. Was it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? Was it lower valuations that pushed them there? What did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry, not just for you folks?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s a combination, Gerard, of all those things. You had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. You also had real volatility. And so people go down the road, doing an IPO, it\u2019s like a tanker. It\u2019s heading down the road. It takes months and months and months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. And you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that you are going to go public at a particular value, a particular price. And all of a sudden, the value of the price is 20% or 30% less and the whole tanker just stops. They can\u2019t turn on a dime and get everybody\u2019s mind reset. And so I think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact. The period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in 2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000, 2001. And then in March 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. It was the beginning of a decline in the NASDAQ, where the NASDAQ ultimately went down 85%. I am not saying that that\u2019s going to happen again here. But really, equity issuance shutoff in late 2001 and 2002 was a really, really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in 2003. And so there is a reset process with all of this. And I think we are on the journey of people\u2019s expectation around valuations being reset.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Can I just \u2013 I just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a 3% GSIB and sort of your comments about lower client activity versus last year. But I think on the flip side, you guys are pretty optimistic around growing \u2013 still growing the financing business. It looks like trading assets are up year-over-year or flat year-over-year. Loans are up, balance sheet is up. So, is this just something about balance sheet and RWA growth slowing or is there specific areas you think will shrink or you can cut?\nDenis Coleman: So, I think we are looking at this holistically. A lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan, our ability to execute to hit targets over time, given the environment that we are in right now, we see an opportunity to target a 3% GSIB. Obviously, it\u2019s for the benefit of 2024, and beyond, but the decision to be made is a current one. And so in terms of our ability to target that level, given what we have seen in terms of various balances, levels of client activity, etcetera, we think we can do that reasonably efficiently. We have had discussions with our business leaders. They know that, that\u2019s the plan. That\u2019s what they are working on. David did make a comment that should the environment change significantly or the needs of our clients change we would reevaluate. But the current plan is to target that level of GSIB. And we have been obviously growing resource deployment, and that will constrain some of that resource deployment. But in addition to targeting a 3% GSIB we can, at the same time, deploy other financial resources to attractive client opportunities. So, our expectation is that we will be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while targeting a 3% GSIB.\nJim Mitchell: Well, can you help us a little bit with the specifics of what you are actually targeting, or is that you are unwilling to disclose that?\nDenis Coleman: We are currently targeting a 3% GSIB. We are not putting out a particular GSIB score that we are targeting.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Try this again here. Just wanted to follow-up on the $20 billion of commitments in \u2013 or third-party funds that you highlighted in the quarter, clearly, there is still strong momentum. As you think about this market backdrop and the outlook for that is there \u2013 are you seeing any change in behavior or signs of slowing?\nDavid Solomon: I would say, Dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we are not seeing significant change in behavior. When you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have significant allocations. Obviously, if the overall value of the portfolio has decreased, the allocation percentage would shift, and so that will slow down capital raising. But I think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, I still think there is a secular growth trend around alternatives that\u2019s very, very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space. I would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as big a participant, but there has been a lot of retail flow into the alternative space. And there my insight there is that is slowing, but it\u2019s not turned off and it\u2019s still adequate. And from what I can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very, very high-end private wealth business, there is still significant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so something to watch. If the environment got much worse, may be that would change, but at the moment, not seeing indications that the changes are meaningful.\nDan Fannon: Great. And then just as a follow-up on the balance sheet outlook and the harvesting of some of the investments. You have historically given a line of sight number on these calls given I would assume the market backdrop in the short-term, there is just less outlook or clarity around what you might be looking to sell here.\nDenis Coleman: I think that\u2019s right. So, last quarter, we gave a line of sight of approximately $1 billion, which is what ended up happening. Right now, line of sight is less than $1 billion, just given the overall environment that\u2019s what we see right now.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: We just wanted to thank everyone for joining the call. Obviously, if any other questions arise, feel free to give me a call directly. Thanks so much. We will speak to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Carey and good morning everybody. Thank you all for joining us. I am pleased with our performance this quarter. There is no question that the market environment has gotten more complicated and a combination of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitics is having a material impact on asset prices, market activity and confidence. We see inflation deeply entrenched in the economy. And what's unusual about this particular period is that both demand and supply are being affected by exogenous events, namely the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chains. Our economist, meanwhile, say there are signs that inflation will move lower in the second half of the year. The answer is uncertain and we will all be watching it very closely. Given all of this, we are seeing shifts in monetary policy and those shifts will continue to tighten economic conditions. I expect there is going to be more volatility and there is going to be more uncertainty. And in light of the current environment, we will manage all our resources cautiously and dynamically. Our risk management culture and capabilities should help us navigate this environment for our clients and for the firm. That said, there is nothing about this environment that changes our strategy and we are committed to our medium-term targets. We have a strong client franchise and we remain focused on providing differentiated service. We benefit from the diversity of our businesses and their global footprint. In light of the environment, we are certainly taking deliberate action on capital and expenses, but we will also continue to invest to strengthen and grow our firm. Let me now turn to our financial results. In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $11.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $7.73 and an ROE of 10.6% and an ROTE of 11.4%. Our book value per share finished the quarter at $302, up 14% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. In Investment Banking, we remain the number one adviser in M&A and equity capital markets. And though capital markets activity has declined, our client dialogue and engagement continues to be strong. This quarter again reaffirmed our strategy to be global, broad and deep in our leading global markets franchise. Each week, clients turn to us for our market expertise and execution in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates the diversification of our businesses across this segment. I am very proud of the fact that we have consistently executed on our strategy to improve our market share as we help our clients manage risk and meet their financing needs. In this environment, our on-balance sheet investments faced significant headwinds after achieving record high net revenues in 2021. Our management and other fees were resilient as we remain focused on growing fee-based revenue streams across our asset management and wealth management segments and further reducing our on-balance sheet investments as markets allow. And in consumer, we are prudently expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally, both organically and through partnerships. Before turning it over to Denis, let me spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. I was glad to see the improvement in our stress capital buffer, especially because the test this year was more challenging than in the past. This is a reflection of the progress we are making in our strategic evolution. That said we will advance our efforts to improve the capital density of our businesses in order to reduce our capital requirements over time. Following the stress test results, our Board of Directors also declared a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share. This follows an increase of 60% in 2021 and over 50% in 2019. In addition, with regard to our GSIB buffer, while we made a conscious decision to grow our balance sheet to support client activity over the last 3 years, it is our current plan to target a 3% GSIB surcharge. This intention is driven by the recent operating environment as well as client needs. Should these change, we will naturally reevaluate. In closing, I remain confident in our ability to navigate the market environment, serve our clients and create long-term value for shareholders. Despite the uncertainty we face, we continue to drive this organization forward by executing our client-oriented strategy and delivering accretive returns consistent with our targets over time. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. I will start, Christian. I don't know if Denis will add anything to it. I think our tone is cautious, because the environment is uncertain. The environment is very uncertain. We don't have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inflationary environment that exists, but there is no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inflation. And as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate confidence and also consumer activity in the economy. I think it's hard to gauge exactly how that will play out. And so I think it's prudent for us to be cautious. Now that said, I think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader, much more diverse, much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago, and we benefited from that in the context of the quarter. So we feel good about our ability to operate. I would say that, at the moment, while there is a lot of uncertainty, clients are still relatively active. Denis was just talking about M&A activity, and our clients are active. Capital markets activity is obviously down. This is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it's certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk. So we continue to monitor it, but I think it's prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious. And if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we're evaluating things with respect to resources. We're being flexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. By the way, we don't know that the environment is going to get worse. The environment might get better, too. So I just think it's a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense.  Now with respect to our targets, I want to be clear, we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on meeting those targets. And we don't see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets. I'm not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way. But I would say in what's been certainly a very difficult first half of the year, if you think about the headwinds we've faced in both public equity markets because of the war in Ukraine and the unwind of the business in Russia, etcetera, I think there have been some exogenous events in this first half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward. So we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we will continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them. Sure. I appreciate the question. And I guess I'd just step back and I'd highlight that we've been building a business from scratch here. It certainly takes investment, and we've been making investment. And we've been pretty clear that we have a long-term strategy to create a leading digital platform in the consumer banking business. Now we've been at it, as I think you know, for 5 years. We've built out a really good deposit platform. We built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology. We have a loans platform. We have some technology around an invest platform, and we've also added GreenSky. With that portfolio of product offerings, we've told you at our update that we expect greater than $4 billion of revenue in 2024. You can obviously see this quarter that we're making progress on revenue in the business. And as we noted, I think when we spoke in February, at the update, we said the vast majority of the build cost associated with the products that will achieve that $4 billion target are in the ground. And so I'd remind you of that comment. On a year-to-date basis, the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves as we grow the business. And just a reminder, CECL requires very, very significant upfront reserve build. So we continue to feel good about the progress we're making, and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to Goldman Sachs over time. And we're committed to the journey that we've set out on to make sure that we do just that over time. I just \u2013 the one thing I realized, Christian, that I didn't touch on is we're very, very focused on the credit box and thinking about the credit box during the early part of the pandemic. When there was enormous uncertainty, we tightened the credit box meaningfully. As Denis highlighted in his opening remarks, we don't see significant indications of credit deterioration in the consumer. But given tightening economic conditions, we're watching that very, very carefully. And to the degree that we saw different signals in the short-term, we would adjust our credit box very dynamically. Good morning. I appreciate the question. And let me try to give some clarity to our thought process. As monetary and fiscal policy were extremely loose and extremely forward, the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very, very rapidly. And the context of that in 2020 and 2021, we saw opportunities to deploy resources, serve our clients and, therefore, expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the profit opportunity for the firm. That environment has certainly shifted in 2022. And while our clients are still active, they are not active to the same degree that they were in 2021. And you can obviously see that in the revenue environment, not just with us but across the street. In stating that we're focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a 3% level, we are making a forward assumption that's consistent with what we've seen in the first half of the year. I note one of the things that I said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different conclusion. We will obviously evaluate that and change that. But based on the experience we've had over the last 6 months, and the revenue opportunity we're capturing, we think we can continue to capture that revenue opportunity available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation, and that should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments. But I would think at this point in time, looking at that, Denis highlighted in his remarks, with the stock trading where it is, we're certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year. Yes. So thanks, Betsy. So look, I think what I'd say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us, given our relationships, our technology, etcetera, that are interested in doing things with us. At the same point, we've done a bunch over the course of the last 5 years to build this business. And as we've said, we put a couple of big partnerships on the ground in cards. We've started an Invest platform. We're now working to integrate GreenSky. I think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute at a very high level. Certainly, as we get out to 2023 and 2024, we will be more open to other partnerships and other meaningful things going forward. But at the moment, we're focused on really executing on what we put forward, which included, as we had highlighted, launching checking later in the year. I'm not sure there was a question there. I think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with. I mean I would highlight, while it's a fair comment that our SCB is higher than everyone else's because of our current business mix, if that's what you refer to as last place, I would comment for the stress test we came in first place is that we were the only firm that actually saw their SCB decrease and many institutions saw their SCB increase very meaningfully. Now I don't take that as a victory lap. We're early in the journey of taking assets off our balance sheet, but I still do think, Mike, one of the big attributes we have, as you look ahead over the next few years, is we are going to continue to make that business much less RWA dense. And I do think, as indicated by the step forward we took in this stress test, that we will hopefully take other steps forward and future tests as we continue to change that mix. I am not satisfied with where we are on the journey of making the firm more fee-based and more resilient. But I am satisfied that we've made meaningful progress. And I think the results this quarter show the diversity of the business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment. And so as someone who's followed the industry and our firm for quite some time, I think the performance in this environment is reflective of the beginning of that evolution. But you're exactly right. We have to constantly balance between investing in the future and providing resources to serve clients when they are active and driving those shareholder returns that kind of are \u2013 is our true north of what we're trying to drive towards. So yes, it's a balance. I think we're trying to strike that balance appropriately, and we're going to continue to be laser-focused on making sure we do as good a job as we can, striking that balance effectively. Well, I guess I'd say a couple of things. We always \u2013 I think we're very nimble allocators of resources, financial resources, human resources. We try to have a very, very flexible, nimble approach. And so of course, we've expressed earlier in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we're going to be cautious. Of course, we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse. With respect to capital markets activity, I think I told you at the beginning of the year in our January call on January 15 that I did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. And I wouldn't call that as normal. So when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years. I, don't think we're going back to that anytime soon. But I do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last 7 years, take a period 5 years, 7 years, and look at average levels, I'd be very surprised if we don't get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters. And history would just tell you that, that doesn't mean that it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain. But generally speaking, one of the things that affects capital markets activity is people have to reset their mind around valuation. They have to reset their mind around capital costs. And that happens relatively quickly because people have plans. They have commitments. They have to invest. And as soon as they get their minds around that, they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that's available to them. And so I'd be very surprised if we don't see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity. Now we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difficult longer. But it's not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we're headed to a super negative environment, but it is uncertain. It is a little bumpy, and so we're going to proceed cautiously. I think it's a good \u2013 I think it's an appropriate thing to look at carefully. I would say, at the moment, real availability issues are limited to some very, very stressed borrowers or some very, very out-of-favor sectors. But I do think sometimes people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price. And so I would say, at the moment, the bigger thing that's slowing down capital markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment. Ultimately, companies need to raise capital. They find that new clearing price. But I do think if the environment stays very, very difficult from an economic perspective, there are certain sectors where availability is an issue. And there are a couple of them now. I would point to retail as one where certainly capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully. And so I think we will watch this very cautiously. But again, I would tell you that there is a mindset when you go through this in a resetting that's going on, and I think ultimately, markets find clearing prices. And capital markets, there is certainly plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices. The most levered companies will have a tougher time in this environment. Well, we obviously \u2013 we made an acquisition in the space. It's something that we are focused on as an opportunity for the firm. But I would say, at this point, the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small. But I think as we look forward over the course of the next 3 years to 5 years, it will be an area that we see opportunity in and we will turn more focus to expanding. That's why we made this acquisition and we think it's an interesting opportunity for us. Well, if we stayed in a macro \u2013 if we stayed in a macro environment, it's \u2013 look, it's a good question. I understand where the question comes from. If we stayed in the macro environment, like the first six months of this year for the next 5 years, I think it would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns. Although I do think that we would be more resilient and probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly, by the way, not just Goldman Sachs, if you really have that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment and people would make changes in their businesses on the expense side, etcetera, over time to make sure that they could deliver appropriately for shareholders. I don't expect \u2013 I think we had a very \u2013 I think this has been a very difficult six months and there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months. I don't expect to have the same headwinds in the next 6 months or the next 12 months. Now that doesn't mean that the environment couldn't be worse or there couldn't be different headwinds that create different issues. But I think to kind of take what's going on with some of the exogenous impact over the course of the last six months and translate it as a 3-year or 4-year thing forward, that's just not our base case. That's not our base case. And if that was our base case, we would be much more aggressive and forward with respect to expense changes, investments in the business, etcetera, but that's not our base case. And so we continue to move forward with the base case, where we are pretty confident that we can deliver the level of revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those returns. And I would just highlight that, in the first half of the year, we are not that far off from what we said we need to accomplish over the next 3 years. Well, the good volatility, bad volatility has never been an expression that I would like. I think about our business in markets as a business were serving our clients, and we re making sure that we are meeting their needs. That's why we have been very focused over the last 3 years, 4 years on really improving our approach to our clients, really improving our market share with our clients, adding financing as a capability to our clients, which is much more resilient and therefore, puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before. Now that doesn't mean that there can't be volatility in the intermediation part of the business. I am not going to make a forecast as to what looks forward, but I think the investments we have made and our client focus and our market shares and our financing business all give those markets businesses more balanced as we go forward. There will be environments where clients are more active and we can capture that and there will be environments where clients are a little bit more quiet, but we are prepared to serve them. And I think if we get out of quarter-to-quarter and continue to look over a 3-year period, there is a very big business that generates very accretive returns and serves our clients well. Good morning. Sure. I will answer at a very high level, and then I am going to have Denis walk you through some specific details. I am pleased with the progress, but not comfortable with where we are. Comfortable is probably the wrong word. I am pleased with the progress. I would like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress. And I think we are going to do \u2013 we are going to make progress over the course of the coming 12 months, 24 months. Our progress \u2013 we have made a lot of progress. It was slowed also by the fact that went through a period in 2021 where the value of a lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things. But why don't I have Denis walk you through some high-level numbers that we have put out there? Yes. It's \u2013 I think it's a combination, Gerard, of all those things. You had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. You also had real volatility. And so people go down the road, doing an IPO, it's like a tanker. It's heading down the road. It takes months and months and months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. And you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that you are going to go public at a particular value, a particular price. And all of a sudden, the value of the price is 20% or 30% less and the whole tanker just stops. They can't turn on a dime and get everybody's mind reset. And so I think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact. The period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in 2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000, 2001. And then in March 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. It was the beginning of a decline in the NASDAQ, where the NASDAQ ultimately went down 85%. I am not saying that that's going to happen again here. But really, equity issuance shutoff in late 2001 and 2002 was a really, really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in 2003. And so there is a reset process with all of this. And I think we are on the journey of people's expectation around valuations being reset. I would say, Dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we are not seeing significant change in behavior. When you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have significant allocations. Obviously, if the overall value of the portfolio has decreased, the allocation percentage would shift, and so that will slow down capital raising. But I think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, I still think there is a secular growth trend around alternatives that's very, very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space. I would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as big a participant, but there has been a lot of retail flow into the alternative space. And there my insight there is that is slowing, but it's not turned off and it's still adequate. And from what I can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very, very high-end private wealth business, there is still significant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so something to watch. If the environment got much worse, may be that would change, but at the moment, not seeing indications that the changes are meaningful."

            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.9 billion and net earnings of $2.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $7.73. We reposted a return on common equity of 10.6% and return on tangible equity of 11.4%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1 billion, down 41% versus a year ago. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion. Our global M&A franchise remained strong as we closed over 115 deals for approximately $380 billion of deal volume in the quarter, further strengthening our number one league table position. Equity underwriting net revenues were $131 million. Industry volumes remain muted given the ongoing market volatility. Despite this, we remain ready to deliver for our clients once the market backdrop for equity issuance improves. Debt underwriting net revenues were $457 million, where we saw lower levels of market activity amid sharp rate increases in the quarter. While our Investment Banking backlog is down from the peak levels last year, it is still higher than it has been at any point in our history prior to 2021. We feel good about the quality of our backlog based on our healthy levels of strategic dialogue that span from technology and innovation to defensive repositioning of client portfolios, but we may see some softening if the challenging market environment persists. Revenues from corporate lending were $352 million, up 121% versus a year ago driven by hedge gains associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately $225 million in marks on certain commitments from our acquisition financing activities. We saw continued growth in our Transaction Banking business. The platform now serves nearly 400 clients and has roughly $65 billion in deposits at the end of the second quarter, generating approximately $175 million in revenues year-to-date. Moving to Global Markets on Page 4, segment net revenues were $6.5 billion in the quarter, up 32% year-on-year. Growth in the quarter was driven by significantly higher client activity as we facilitated risk intermediation for clients amid a volatile market. Looking at FICC on Page 5, revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter. In FICC intermediation, we saw a 50% increase in revenues with 3 of our 5 FICC intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the strength and breadth of our diversified franchise. Our macro franchise remained incredibly active as we help clients navigate rising rates, tightening monetary policies and continued volatility across commodities. This drove strong growth in net revenues in rates, commodities and currencies. And while revenues were lower year-on-year in credit and mortgages, clients remain engaged. Meanwhile, in FICC financing, we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity, which helped delivered record results. Moving to equities, net revenues in the second quarter were a solid $2.9 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 2% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment. Activity was also impacted by lower levels of primary issuance volumes. Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose 38% versus a year ago and 14% versus the first quarter. Increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for various forms of financing from our clients. Growth in equities financing, coupled with record performance in FICC financing, is a reflection of our strategy to grow client financing activities, which represented nearly 30% of our overall Global Markets revenues this quarter. Moving to Asset Management on Page 6. Asset Management net revenues of $1.1 billion were materially lower than the second quarter of last year. Growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by net losses from our on-balance sheet investment portfolio. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, up 39% year-over-year. This increase was driven by the roll-off of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of $305 billion of incremental AUS from the recently completed acquisition of NNIP, which contributed roughly $170 million of management and other fees this quarter. Equity investments generated losses of $221 million, driven by sharp market declines during the quarter. More specifically, on our public equity portfolio, we experienced roughly $660 million of net losses, reducing the value of the portfolio to approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end. In our private portfolio, we produced approximately $440 million of net revenues. We generated event-driven gains of over $380 million from various positions across the portfolio. Additionally, we had operating revenues of approximately $165 million related to our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially offset by approximately $100 million of marks, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. We remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more third-party funds. And in the second quarter, we raised over $20 billion of commitments. We also harvested over $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments. The pace of our realizations this quarter was influenced by both macro and micro drivers with persistent volatility in equity markets, making it more difficult to harvest assets. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $137 million, down 78% versus a year ago as net interest income of $275 million was partly offset by mark-to-market losses of approximately $140 million due to spread widening. I will turn to Consumer & Wealth Management on Page 9. We produced record net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, up 25% versus a year ago, driven by higher net revenues in both Wealth Management and Consumer Banking. For the quarter, wealth management and other fees of $1.2 billion rose 10% versus last year, driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision. While private banking and lending net revenues of $320 million were down relative to record results last quarter, revenues were up 23% year-on-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer banking revenues were $608 million in the second quarter, rising 67% versus last year and 26% versus the first quarter. Now moving to Page 10. Total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion. Combined firm-wide management and other fees in the second quarter rose 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. We expect our fee revenues to continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this year. On Page 11, total firm-wide net interest income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to the first quarter due to lower net interest income in Global Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $176 billion, up $10 billion versus the first quarter primarily due to growth in corporate, wealth management and residential real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $667 million, up from $561 million in the first quarter. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled losses due to economic indicators worsening quarter-over-quarter. Overall, our portfolio fundamentals remain strong as reflected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book. On the consumer side, while we do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration, we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking mitigating actions as appropriate. Now, let's turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4 billion. Year-over-year increases were driven by integration and run-rate expenses related to the NNIP and GreenSky acquisitions as well as continued investments, particularly in technology, and higher levels of business activity. Together, NNIP and GreenSky contributed approximately $200 million to non-compensation expenses this quarter. Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources. As a result, we are taking a number of actions to improve our operating efficiency. Specifically, we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward, though these actions will take some time to be reflected in our results. We are keeping in mind, however, that while we are being disciplined about our expenses, we are not doing so to the detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy. Turning to capital on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach, down 20 basis points sequentially and representing an 80 basis point buffer to our current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year. This past quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of over $700 million. As David noted earlier, in the third quarter, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share. Looking ahead, we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. While we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive, we are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price. In conclusion, our solid second quarter results reflect our ability to navigate volatile markets, while actively supporting our clients. We remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity, which will help us serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets. And we are committed to executing on our growth strategy and delivering for our shareholders. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. Thanks, Glenn. It's Denis. Let me take that for you. So, we made a number of remarks with respect to the composition of our on-balance sheet equity investments. And specifically, we made note of event-driven gains of approximately $380 million during the quarter. We noted a markdown of $100 million approximately across consumer and technology sectors. And what I would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on a very, very granular basis. It's comprised of both corporate and real estate assets. And we look at the performance, for example, of our private equity names, their top line performance. On average, they are growing north of 20%. And if we were to take a look at some public comparable, albeit an imperfect one, those are growing in a negative fashion. And so it reflects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of those particular businesses. What I would say in terms of the overall advisory performance, you can see the headline number, which is quite significant at $1.2 billion. And we have our sustained number one market share position across both announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors. I think this is an environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on what's particularly strategic for them. The nature of the transactions that they maybe considering could very well be different in their complexion than a year ago, but nevertheless, our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them navigate the market. So, we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement. There is no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if confidence were impaired, we could see some softening even in our advisory activities. But to-date, they have been strong. On the underwriting side, that's much more a reflection of the current capital markets' receptivity, and again, strong levels of client engagement. We like our backlog, but it is \u2013 there will be a better market environment required in order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that backlog. Thanks, Glenn. Steven, thanks. It's Denis. Let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide some context. So as we noted, with respect to the consumer portion, that's really driven by ongoing growth in the asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality. And on the wholesale side, we obviously model the macroeconomic outlook. And when we do our work across our various scenarios, over the course of the first quarter into the second quarter, our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables from GDP growth to employment levels to inflation, probability of recession, possibility of stagflation, etcetera. And so we reweighted our scenarios, and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see. We continue to invest in our franchise. We think it's important to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients, but we will continue to provide appropriately along the way. Hey, Betty, it's Denis. Maybe I'll take that one. As you suggest, we feel really good about the transaction banking business, it's progress year-to-date and the forward. We continue to improve on each of the metrics that we've been reporting on, so nearly 400 clients, deposits at around $65 billion revenues year-to-date $175 million. And importantly, we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational. Operational and fully insured deposits are now north of 35% at the end of the second quarter. So we will continue to focus on growing overall clients balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business. It's obviously a profitable business already. And it's a business, as David highlighted, that benefits from leveraging the relationships that we have already inside the firm to grow it incrementally. Sure. So two components to your question. And obviously, we manage the firm to an efficiency ratio, looking at both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation meaning as you would have seen through the first half of the year, we've taken compensation expense down significantly, $3.5 billion less comp expense in the first half versus the first half last year. And at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation side of the equation. As we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring, decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year, something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efficiency of our human capital resources, given overall environment. And you're right, some of that will take time to reflect itself through the P&L. So I think that's the right expectation. You are correct in anticipating that we're also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non-compensation expense. Some of them are \u2013 dovetail well with investments that we're making to grow the firm. And some of those activities will obviously look to continue. We may slow the pace, but we will continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the firm. And there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we actually see the impact of inflation, impacting on the overall level of expense. And so that's just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efficiency target, which is I think the comments and references that both David and I have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front. I mean another thing I would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity. So, as an example, in our FICC financing business, there are a number of clients who are looking for financing. They have important transactions to execute, attractive assets to have financed. And to the extent that there is less availability of financing across the street, that presents an opportunity for us given the way that we are currently positioned, our focus on financing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users. Sure. I appreciate the question. I mean connecting it back to some of the comments that Dave has made looking back over the course of the last couple of years, we have gone through an extraordinary period. We see an ongoing transition into a new type of market environment. I am sure there are some clients that have looked to de-lever themselves and position for the current operating environment. We continue to see very high levels of client opportunity. There was a lot of engagement in the second quarter particularly in the macro businesses clients approaching us to help them intermediate risk, other clients looking for financing, which is why we had record performance in FICC financing. And I think as we look forward, we are obviously starting the quarter with a buffer to our minimum capital position. We remain very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half. We think there should be some good opportunities and there may be clients that incrementally turned to us to help them navigate the opportunities. So, I think we are \u2013 we feel well set up, and we are optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half. Sure. I think I would frame it actually as a combination of those factors. So, your seasoning point is fair as well. It's a less aged portfolio, if you will, than certain other broad-based consumer portfolios. There is an element of seasoning. There is an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to call us \u2013 that that's the appropriate place to be. You do make reference to charge-offs. Obviously, firm-wide, they are flat quarter-on-quarter. Wholesale, down slightly. Consumer is up a little bit. But those are some of the factors that we also take into account and look at. Yes. I mean I think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation, so whether the impact presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year. The starting point \u2013 the overall health of the consumer is very strong. The credit environment for consumers has been very, very benign. And so I think you need to take stock of sort of where you are starting from. Obviously, if the environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession, then we would expect an increase in that regard. Yes. So, a couple of things. I think we are \u2013 we are well on our way in terms of the journey. We remain completely committed to the progress and the direction of travel. You will note there were no particular additions over the course of the last quarter. We continued to move down certain of the on-balance sheet equity exposures. We have a detailed asset-by-asset plan that we are executing on. And looking at our results coming through CCAR, Obviously, the Fed recognized our strong PPNR, but we also suspect that the way they concluded the ultimate decision around SCB had something to do with the nature of our on-balance sheet equity investments and the shocks that they choose to apply against that portfolio. And so that's incremental affirmation that we have selected the right strategy. And then if anything, we should continue to move forward, maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition, remaining mindful of the overall environment and the ability to execute. But I think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing those exposures is completely unchanged. So, I think we are looking at this holistically. A lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan, our ability to execute to hit targets over time, given the environment that we are in right now, we see an opportunity to target a 3% GSIB. Obviously, it's for the benefit of 2024, and beyond, but the decision to be made is a current one. And so in terms of our ability to target that level, given what we have seen in terms of various balances, levels of client activity, etcetera, we think we can do that reasonably efficiently. We have had discussions with our business leaders. They know that, that's the plan. That's what they are working on. David did make a comment that should the environment change significantly or the needs of our clients change we would reevaluate. But the current plan is to target that level of GSIB. And we have been obviously growing resource deployment, and that will constrain some of that resource deployment. But in addition to targeting a 3% GSIB we can, at the same time, deploy other financial resources to attractive client opportunities. So, our expectation is that we will be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while targeting a 3% GSIB. We are currently targeting a 3% GSIB. We are not putting out a particular GSIB score that we are targeting. I think that's right. So, last quarter, we gave a line of sight of approximately $1 billion, which is what ended up happening. Right now, line of sight is less than $1 billion, just given the overall environment that's what we see right now."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 14, 2022. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statement and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me now pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us this morning. There's no question the first quarter was extremely volatile. Russia invaded Ukraine, inflation rose across the globe, and we saw an accelerating trend towards de-globalization. In recent decades, we've grown used to low inflation, low interest rates and the free flow of people and goods across national borders. I believe we're entering a period that won't be -- that won't be the case and the consequences for financial markets will be meaningful. Although, much remains uncertain, I'm proud that Goldman Sachs effectively supported its clients in this type of environment. This is a testament to the progress we've made to center our strategy around clients. At a time of great volatility it was clear, our clients needed help managing their risk, and they turn to us for our expertise in navigating this changing landscape. The recent turbulence is nothing to change our firm's client-oriented strategy. In fact, it makes it all the more imperative. We are building a more resilient, diversified franchise that can generate solid returns even in more uncertain markets. In February, I laid out our revised medium-term return targets. I'm very proud that even with the headwinds we faced; our results this quarter meet those objectives. We are also well positioned to achieve the targets we laid out for our growth initiatives across asset management, wealth management, transaction banking and consumer. In some areas, we have accelerated our progress with the acquisitions, including GreenSky, which closed in late March; and NNIP, which closed earlier this week. I'm thrilled to be welcoming these great businesses to Goldman Sachs. For the quarter, we produced net revenues of $12.9 billion, generated earnings per share of $10.76, an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%. As I noted, the evolving market backdrop had a significant effect on client activity. This meant that some parts of our firm faced significant headwinds, like equity capital markets, where issuance volumes were lackluster for the quarter. On the other hand, Global Markets had a strong quarter, as this environment allowed us to support clients in the risk intermediation and financing needs. And in line with our strategy, several of our growth areas continue to reflect durability despite the difficult environment. For example, we saw solid management and other fees across asset management, wealth management, as well as revenue growth in our consumer business. But there's no question that the most significant event of the first quarter was the invasion of Ukraine. As I've said before, we condemn the invasion in the strongest possible terms, and our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. This act of aggression demands a response that Goldman Sachs is committed to doing its part. Early on, we took action to ensure the well-being of our people and to begin winding down our firm's operations in Russia. That process is ongoing. Let me also say a few words on our direct financial exposure to Russia. Our positions were relatively limited, but we've been focused on closing them out and reducing our exposure. The overall direct financial impact from Russia and Ukraine related instruments on our first quarter revenues was a net loss of approximately $300 million. Our risk mitigation efforts would not have been possible without the close collaboration of our people around the globe on both the business and the control side of our firm. Our risk management culture is a true differentiator for us, and we continue to navigate - as we continue to navigate this volatile environment. More broadly, the Russian invasion has further complicated the geopolitical landscape and created an additional level of uncertainty that I expect will outlast the war itself. While it is encouraging to see a newfound unity among the Western democracies, the trend towards deglobalization is clearly gaining momentum. The consequences of that shift are likely to be significant and long lasting, and I believe it will take some time to fully appreciate all the second and third [order] (ph) ramifications. Beyond geopolitics, I'm keeping a close eye on several other trends. While US unemployment levels are low and wages are increasing, inflation is the highest it's been in decades. We're seeing new stress on supply chain and commodity prices and US households are facing rising gas prices as well as higher prices for food and housing. We've also seen an increased risk of stagflation and mixed signals on consumer confidence. These cross currents will certainly create ongoing complexity in the economic outlook, but whatever the future holds, I believe Goldman Sachs is well positioned. We continue to make progress on our growth strategy and our commitments to clients a strong -- our commitment to clients is stronger than ever. I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.9 billion and net earnings of $3.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $10.76. As David noted, firm-wide performance was strong with an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%, notwithstanding an operating environment that was significantly less favorable than the prior year. Turning to performance by segment starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.4 billion. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, as our M&A franchise continued its outstanding performance and client dialogue remain significantly elevated. In the quarter, we closed over 115 deals for approximately $385 billion of deal volume and maintained our number one league table position with nearly $360 billion in announced transactions. This was roughly $155 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, the largest quarterly lead in our history as a public firm. In equity underwriting, net revenues were $261 million, down significantly versus a record performance in the first quarter of 2021 on the lower industry issuance volumes that David mentioned. Despite this, we continue to rank number one year-to-date in equity and equity-related offerings with volume market share of 8%. Debt underwriting net revenues were $743 million, 16% lower versus the prior year, driven by lower results in leveraged finance and asset-backed activity. While transactions have slowed from the elevated pace of last year and deals have been pushed out, given the uncertain backdrop, our investment banking backlog remains robust. Client engagement is strong, catalyzed by secular trends like digital disruption and transformation across industries and future activity will likely be bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors. Moving to Global Markets on page four. Segment net revenues were $7.9 billion in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. We saw exceptional strength in both our FICC and Equities businesses. On page five, you can see revenues across FICC were $4.7 billion in the first quarter, 21% higher than the strong results in the first quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $4 billion. This was driven by particular strength in our macro products with elevated activity across rates, currencies, and commodities. These macro businesses within FICC, which generally represent the preponderance of FICC intermediation revenues, benefit from a portfolio effect. Our diversified and global footprint, combined with our risk intermediation and execution capabilities is a key differentiator. FICC financing generated record revenues of $685 million, which were up 23% sequentially and 55% year-on-year with particular strength in mortgages. Total equities revenues were $3.1 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 16% year-over-year, driven by lower activity in both cash and derivatives due to fewer market-making opportunities compared to a very strong backdrop at the start of 2021. Equity financing produced net revenues of $988 million. Though lower on a year-on-year basis, these results were 21% higher sequentially. While average prime balances declined slightly from record levels at year-end, opportunities to provide client liquidity increased, which drove stronger quarterly performance. Moving to Asset Management on page six, first quarter revenues were $546 million, materially lower than the first quarter of last year due to market headwinds in equity investments and lending and debt investments. Management and other fees totaled $772 million, up 4% sequentially. Net revenues for equity investments were negative $360 our public and private portfolios, we experienced substantial losses tied to Russia-related positions, all of which have been written down to 0. More broadly, we experienced additional headwinds due to the overall market environment. All in, we experienced roughly $620 million of net losses in our public portfolio, offset by approximately $255 million in net gains across our private portfolio, largely due to event-driven items, including asset sales and financing rounds. We harvested $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments in the first quarter. We remain fully committed to reducing this portfolio over time and have line of sight on another $1 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to approximately $750 million of capital reduction. Turning to page nine, Consumer & Wealth Management produced revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter, up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. In Wealth Management, quarterly management and other fees were $1.3 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 on seasonality and counseling fees, but up 17% year-over-year. Private Banking and lending net revenues of $339 million were up 28% year-on-year, driven by higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $483 million in the first quarter, up 28% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. We continue to grow credit card loans and deposit balances. Next, on page 10. Across these two segments, total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion, with a quarterly decline, primarily driven by net market depreciation of $94 billion, partially offset by $24 billion of long-term net inflows. Combined firm-wide management and other fees for the first quarter rose 15% year-over-year to $2 billion, driven by higher average AUS versus last year. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the first quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting higher loan balances and lower funding costs. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $166 billion, up $8 billion versus year-end 2021, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and credit cards. For the first quarter, our provision for credit losses was $561 million, up from $344 million in the fourth quarter. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to the growth in our lending portfolio as well as broader macroeconomic factors, including a slowing growth outlook. As we continue to expand our consumer business and grow our lending activities, we are cognizant that macro headwinds and inflationary pressures could potentially weigh on payment rates and thus portfolio performance. While we have not seen any meaningful signs of deterioration in credit metrics, we are being vigilant and will continue to monitor performance and macro conditions to assess risk mitigation measures and calibrate our underwriting where needed. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year. This drove an efficiency ratio for the quarter of 59.7%. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $3.6 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, driven by our continued investments, particularly in technology, that will further enhance our infrastructure and support our strategic growth initiatives. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.4% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of roughly $700 million. As it relates to the second quarter, we deployed capital to support the closing of the NNIP transaction, and we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect the durability and resilience of our client franchise across almost any environment. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical complexity, we remain focused on executing on our strategic plan to diversify our business mix and drive competitive returns for shareholders, and we have significant confidence in our forward momentum as an organization. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So, I appreciate the $1 billion harvesting out of the balance sheet PE and the other $1 billion coming up. So, it's a partial answer to the question. But in the backdrop that we've seen with slowing M&A in almost no IPOs. My original question was going to be, can you still get to that SCB of 5% that's so important to give us all confidence about putting up that 15% to 17% return over time? How do you view that forward look of the march towards 5%?\nDenis Coleman: So Glenn, it's Denis. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Obviously, our results in the quarter in terms of RoTE of 15.8% and ROE was 15%. Our medium-term targets that you referenced were to be achieved by 2024. So we're really pleased with the performance in this quarter. As it relates to SCB, for us, it continues to be making the choices that we can with respect to investing in our business mix, creating more durable and predictable revenue streams, and then also continuing to migrate down our on-balance sheet equity position. So I think our commitment to the strategy remains intact. We have, obviously, submitted our CCAR submission, and we await response from the Federal Reserve. And we will continue to focus on driving those aspects of our business that we can, all of which we hope will contribute to an SCB that is lower and reflects our business mix.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate that it's working so far good first quarter. Maybe a little follow-up on the sponsor side. And it's both as you as someone that's planning to raise a lot of third-party money as an alternative manager and also you as the largest servicer of that sponsor community, can you give a little insight towards just what's going on? Do you expect -- is the capital raising environment disrupted. You harvested $1 billion, but can you still have a decent harvesting backdrop amidst the disruptive banking backdrop? Thanks so much.\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Glenn, it's David. And I'll jump in here. I would say that there are a variety of secular tailwinds that are still driving lots of institutional capital on a global basis towards broad alternatives platforms. I think despite the volatility that exists in markets, those trends continue to be in place. And I think you'll continue to see secular growth in the amount of capital, institutional capital that's allocated to alternatives platforms for quite some time. In the context of that, I think we and others do have big broad multi-product, global platforms that are well-positioned. And so while the pace of fundraising might ebb and flow a little bit from peaks, I think the general secular trend is still in place in this volatility. I don't think in the short run will affect that. With respect to monetizations and values, there is no question that we've gone through a period of time where the macro backdrop certainly created an acceleration of that. There were a variety of factors that I think were more short-term than amplified that. And I think we've commented in the past about the fact that we did not think that was levels of activity were sustainable. However, even in an environment like this, when you have a broad diversified portfolio of assets, and there are certainly lots of areas where there's real growth in the economy, and the economy is still growing very well, the opportunity to see monetizations, to see transactions, I think, continues just probably not at the same pace and velocity as we saw in 2020 and 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Autonomous.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning. So overall RoTE of 16% was pretty impressive in the quarter, given it was a pretty challenging backdrop. Are you now in a place where you think, given the diversity of the business model that Goldman should pretty much always earn cost of capital on a quarterly basis?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I mean, I -- always is a definitive word. We never say always to anything because there certainly could be environments that we do not foresee that could produce the distribution of outcomes, a very skewed outcome in one direction or the other. I do think that this leadership team over the last almost four years has made significant investments in our business and that has allowed us to grow our business, and that has allowed us to better plan in our business given some of the investments and planning process we made that hopefully, over time, will give the market more confidence in the durability of these returns. I think we're well-positioned. In February, we laid out these medium-term targets. We do not lay out targets lightly. So I would never comment on what could happen in any given quarter, Christian, but I think we have a larger more durable business, and I think we're going to continue to add to that durability as we move forward, and we're very committed to executing on that strategy.\nChristian Bolu: Okay. Thanks. On FICC, just maybe more broadly, intermediation businesses. How do you think about the potential going forward as the Fed sort of shrink its balance sheet and raises rates, trying to figure out the potential for meaningfully good volatility and greater demand for risk intermediation services versus any sort of funding cost headwinds that may occur?\nDavid Solomon: So I mean, I comment from a macro perspective on a couple of things with respect to that. And I'm not smart enough to know what good volatility or bad volatility is. We're more focused on serving our clients and ensuring that we have the highest market share available with those clients as they position their portfolios that they transact. Intermediation is a big business. I think it's always going to be a big business. That doesn't mean that it can't ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. But I think that one way to frame this is that the size of the available intermediation activity that's out there for firms like ourselves that play a big role in this is bigger today than it was five years ago, going back pre-pandemic. And in addition, based on investments we've made both in the client centricity and the approach we're taking and in technology, our market shares are larger, and we think those market share gains are durable. I'd also highlight that we've been -- and we've been very clear with you on this, building our financing capability for those clients and one of the things about that business now is a larger proportion of it is financing revenue and that financing revenue is more durable. So I feel good about the way the business is positioned. I won't speculate on what every quarter will look like going forward. But certainly, I think, we're better positioned in this business today than we were five years ago. And I think that's reflected, for example, in a quarter like this and the results of the client activity we're able to accomplish.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning. So wanted to start off with a question on capital management. You guys were clear positive outliers in the quarter. Many of your peers reported pretty significant drawdowns in CET1. Admittedly, I was a bit surprised to see the improvement in your ratios, just given a lot of the sources of RWA inflation that have been cited on some of the other calls have really highlighted market risk RWA inflation. I was hoping you can just give some perspective on how much of an impact did you see from higher market risk RWAs in the quarter, where you could see some relief down the road? And just given the accretion in capital you saw in the quarter, whether there's any appetite to accelerate buybacks, especially into a declining share price?\nDenis Coleman: Sure, Steven. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our build of capital over the course of the quarter, that was deliberate. We knew that at the beginning of the second quarter that we would have to pay for the NNIP acquisition. And so we had -- we've grown our capital over the course of the first quarter. We also were very disciplined on RWA growth. Our growth was $5 billion on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we were able to deliver types of results that David just made reference to across our big businesses while maintaining a discipline with respect to RWA growth so that also contributed to the improvement. Now as it relates to our outlook, we've been reasonably clear that our first priority in terms of driving long-term results for shareholders and supporting clients is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities. And once again, you would see in the first quarter with the Global Markets segment ROE north of 25% and firm line ROE at 15%, there certainly were attractive client deployment opportunities, and we prioritized that. We remain focused on sustainably growing a dividend. And then obviously, to the extent the opportunities to support clients or the market environment shifts, obviously, we'd look to return that capital back to shareholders. I would say from where I sit right now, looking at the second quarter, my expectation on buybacks is to be reasonably consistent with the first quarter, but we do expect to remain nimble. And to the extent that the opportunity set with clients is less attractive and you make reference to the then prevailing share price, that's obviously something that we'll consider.\nSteven Chubak: That's great color, Denis. And just for my follow-up on the investment banking businesses. You noted the backlogs are stable year-on-year, certainly a good outcome given the macro uncertainty. But I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more granularity on the individual investment banking businesses and more specifically, how you expect them to perform over the next, call it, six to 12 months? And how much of the slowdown that we've first quarter would you attribute to growing macro risks and waning CEO confidence that could drive a more prolonged slowdown versus maybe something that's more temporary due to the elevated market volatility?\nDavid Solomon: So I'll start, Steve, and just say that, that activity level is still quite high and engagement from our banking clients is still quite high. There's no question that equity beta kind of turned off for the quarter. And so one of the things that happened was a bunch of equity issuance that was supposed to happen in the quarter got pushed out. That definitely is a market volatility effect. And my guess is as the market volatility settles down during the course of the year to the degree that it does, that will bring some of that issuance back into the marketplace. We've seen when you look over the course of the last 20 years, plenty of periods of time where there are quarters where you have very, very low equity issuance, it's been very rare that, that continues for a year or a longer period and that doesn't mean that, that couldn't happen, but certainly that would be expected given the history. As businesses need capital, they need to make investments at a time as prices reset or values reset, people need some time to absorb those changes versus their expectations. But ultimately, at the end of the day, they understand the reality and they move forward. I don't see a significant change in kind of strategic dialogue. I would say if the world got materially worse and materially more volatile given some of the geopolitical stuff that was going on, that certainly would have the potential to slow down some of the strategic activity and dialogue, but at the moment that activity level and certainly the engagement remains quite good, quite robust. But we watch it very, very closely. I would note that I think it's important to just recognize and we said this at the year-end, at year-end on the year-end call that the activity levels that we saw in 2021 in the banking business, nobody expected those to be normalized levels. So I'd certainly describe a little bit of what we're seeing as a normalization. And I think first quarter overall activity, there's some normalization of that, although, I think equity is well below what I would call a normalized trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning.\nDavid Solomon : Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: I know we've talked a lot about the investment banking side of the business. Maybe we could turn to the loan growth areas that you're focused on. And just want to understand what you're expecting there from some of the recent acquisitions like GreenSky, some of the new relationships that you've got, I know it's been a couple of years already, but Apple Card is growing nicely from the GM relationship. How should we think about the capital call that that piece of the business will have? And what kind of growth rate you expect to get this year? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Hi, Betsy. Thank you very much for the question. Look, we've been very focused on growing these businesses and whether it be loan growth across the consumer platform in terms of installment loan business or the cards businesses or now with the acquisition of GreenSky, or whether it be across private wealth channels or even across our FICC financing businesses, we have a strategic objective to continue to grow those businesses in a credit sensitive fashion. And in terms of thinking about the impact and how to think about that through the P&L, you'll see that in the first quarter, we did raise our provisions for credit losses. They were at 561 versus 344 and a primary driver of that was our growth in loan activity. So that's something that we expect across these businesses as we grow them. We expect as we grow the portfolio of GreenSky that will also continue to provision. So it remains focused for the firm. We're looking at across multiple channels and trying to keep in mind sort of underwriting credit quality as we do so.\nBetsy Graseck: Yes. And that's kind of the follow-up I had, because we've got the forward curve looking for something like nine rate hikes this year, a few more next year. And so there's a triangulation between rate hikes and credit quality. And how are you thinking about that? When you talk about the provision increase you've done, maybe you could unpack that a little bit as to how much of that was coming from loan volume increase expected versus what you're anticipating for credit quality changes, given that backdrop I just mentioned?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Fair enough. And that's a question we're very, very focused on. I mean, in terms of looking at the portfolio and its performance, we have not yet seen a change in the overall credit quality of our portfolios. We remain very mindful of that, given some of the headwinds that are on the forward, but if you look at metrics like our charge-offs in the first quarter, they were $154 million, net charge-off rate of 0.4% unchanged quarter-over-quarter.  And as we think about growing these particular businesses, underwriting standards and the credit box remain top of mind as we continue to grow. And to the extent we see indications significantly slowing rates in terms of payments or the percentage of people making their minimum payments that are indications of future credit deterioration, that will be a signal for us and we can obviously take risk mitigating actions in the forward as a result.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi, if you could just, David and team, maybe just summarize where you think we are in terms of normalizing? You said equity underwriting would be below normal and maybe trading is way above. And I know nobody has a crystal ball and it's tough. But one of your competitor banks talked about volatility remaining elevated. And I don't know, just how should we think about the normalization of the legacy capital market businesses here? And also, how much did commodities contribute to this quarter? Was it a record or close to a record?\nDavid Solomon: So, Mike, I don't -- it's \u2013 and I know I just used it myself, I use the term normalization. We're talking about the equity capital markets business. It's very easy for me to look at equity capital markets revenues for the quarter and say, that's not a normalized run rate level for that business. I would also tell you that the equity capital markets revenues in the first quarter of 2021 was not a normal level for the business.  When you talk about the broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and end markets, again, I would amplify I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you exactly where it's going to settle out, but I think these are good businesses, where we have a high degree of confidence that through market cycles, we can produce very nice returns in these businesses.  We think it's a very powerful ecosystem combining these two businesses together with the global scale and footprint that we have. And we expect them to continue to be big contributors to accretive returns to allow us to meet our targets broadly. Commodities was not a record. There's no question that when you look at the FICC macro business where there was really great performance, it was well diversified across rates, commodities and currencies. I mean the macro businesses certainly outperformed. But that's what I'd say to that point.  So again, I'd go back, I think these businesses are in terms of available wallet for people like ourselves that compete in them they are fundamentally bigger than they were five years ago because the market cap growth around the world and that creates a good opportunity for us in addition we continue to invest in things in those businesses, which we think strengthen our competitive position. but it's hard for me to give you a predicted normal revenue number, it's just not that kind of business.\nMike Mayo: All right. Let me follow up a different way then. In terms of your market share improvement with your capital markets businesses with corporates, I know that's part of the, kind of, the one firm directive, can you -- do you have any metrics around that progress and how you're doing with corporates?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I mean we -- I'll point out something that I think is an anecdotal metric, but I think it's interesting. We have 100 -- when you open the M&A lead table, which is something obviously we dominate, we have $155 billion lead for the quarter. That's the largest one quarter lead we've ever had in our history in the M&A lead table. So that's a metric that's reflective of clients coming to us. We're tracking our market shares quite closely across investment banking and also across global markets. And we've seen market share gains across both over the course of the last couple of years, and we'll continue to track them and make investments where we think we can strengthen them to make sure they're very durable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Betsy asked about this broadly, but maybe more narrowly with GreenSky now closed. How should we think about loans? From my understanding, their loans were securitized, right? So, basically, is the idea that they will mature off and as GreenSky underwrites new loans, then those loans would be on Goldman's balance sheet, and so it would just sort of naturally migrate as the portfolio matures and is reissued? And should we think about it just getting to that roughly $10 billion level where GreenSky had been running? How should we think about that?\nDavid Solomon: So in terms of our strategy, we would expect over time that as GreenSky continues to originate, we would take those loans onto our balance sheet. We certainly would retain the flexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously. But the goal over time is to ramp up those balances onto our balance sheet. I think they had origination volumes of approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter. And so, we're stepping into them based on that level of activity, and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thank you for that. And then, similarly, as far as deposits and deposit costs. What are the expectations for deposit beta in Marcus for this rate hiking cycle? Last cycle was a little unusual. It was a growing and newer platform, more established now. As a happy Marcus customer and myself, I've been watching my yield that it hasn't really moved much, which is not that surprising, because we're just getting started. But how should we be thinking about that on a go-forward?\nDenis Coleman: Fair enough. You're right to observe that we have not increased our market savings rate. Look, in terms of how we're thinking about the deposit betas across the channels, I mean, that really -- you really need a through-the-cycle experience. We have a certain expectation for these businesses that will prove out through the cycle. This cycle will be different than previous cycles. Obviously, I would say at the very, very beginning part of the cycle, the experience is outperforming our expectations. But I think that's because we recognize that the maturity of our portfolio and our time in the business is less than some of our biggest competitors. But we remain really focused on managing that, continuing to drive deposit growth and support the other origination activities across our lending platforms.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning, David and Denis. Maybe I'll just stick on the same theme here on consumer. I'd love to talk about just the consumer product road map and what we could expect from here, I'm sure you don't want to kind of give away your entire hand here, but just kind of what to think about as a natural extension coming next? And then obviously, with the Apple news and kind of where they're going, how that affects buy now pay later and any other kind of parts of the strategy in terms of timing?\nDenis Coleman: Okay. Great. Thank you for the question. So in terms of our aspirations to build the leading global digital consumer bank, a lot of the pieces to the puzzle are in place at this point. A lot of those investments have been made, and we feel really good about the progress across the various lending and deposit platforms that we've invested in and built out. I mean to give you a sense, our active customers in the consumer space are north of $13 million now. And that number in the fourth quarter was less than $10 million. So we continue to see attractive active customer acquisition, both organically and inorganically, which is an important piece of the strategy. I think perhaps next up on the product road map will be the launch of checking. We're already piloting that internally, and we expect to launch that more broadly to our clients later this year. And that will be -- I think that will be an important piece of the product road map for us.\nDavid Solomon: The only thing I would add to that, Devin, is I just highlight back in the February update, we put out a $4 billion revenue target. And I just want to tie that target to what Denis said when he said most of the investment was made. Most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so that's something I want to amplify. And then just finally, because you referenced it, our partnership with Apple is very, very strong. While there's been a Bloomberg article about what Apple is doing Apple or we have -- have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time, and I would just say we're very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Terrific. Thanks for the color. Quick follow-up just on the operating leverage in the model and maybe just starting on comp ratio. I know it's very the year, so it's hard to give much of a prediction. But comp ratio net provision was 100 basis points lower than the first quarter of last year, even with, I would say, kind of an unfavorable mix. So is there anything we should read into that just around kind of how to think about the full year and just overall leverage on comp relative to revenues based on the current backdrop?\nDavid Solomon: Well, as we've said always, we're a pay-for-performance culture. This is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the first quarter. We manage this very closely. We're comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively. And we will also obviously pay for performance. So I'm not going to speculate going forward, but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time. And we obviously -- the one thing I'd just highlight is our focus on our efficiency ratio, and that's something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to the efficiency ratio. And so that also affects our decision-making as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. A question just on asset management with the NN deal now closed. Do you see yourself as a scale provider with that property now? And then within that, maybe highlight or remind us what the opportunity set is with that business in terms of incremental growth now that it's closed?\nDavid Solomon: Sure and I appreciate the question, Dan. I mean I would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition, but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in Europe. It opens that some interesting distribution channel, and it accelerates some of our capabilities around ESG-oriented products. So, it was a good step forward to expand that growth. I believe -- Carey will correct me if I'm wrong, it's the fifth largest active asset manager in the world at the moment. We see opportunity based on our footprint, our global position, our client mix, our strong position and alternative to continue to grow that business, both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with NN, and so we're going to continue to strengthen our position there, but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities and alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the firm.\nDan Fannon: That's helpful. I guess just in similar context with wealth in terms of the outlook for growth, that's also an area where there has been a fair amount of consolidation within the industry. Do you see yourself as a potential participant in that? And maybe kind of the acceleration of hiring and/or some of the initiatives you put in place, how are you thinking about kind of the growth of the wealth business at this point?\nDavid Solomon: Well, you can see from our earnings, the growth of the wealth business year-over-year. We continue to be focused on that opportunity. And I'd just highlight that that's a process that takes time. You add wealth advisers, you add footprint. It's a slower growth -- it's a slower process if you do it organically. But we see it as a very big opportunity. I think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space. It's only been the last couple of years first with the United Capital acquisition and also to our AECO channel, we're meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that we've been focused on really broadening that footprint. I think we're off to a good start there, but I think there's a lot of organic opportunity to still exist I think our Ayco channel, Goldman Sachs Ayco is a very, very unique platform to work through corporations. And I do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping our employees with Wealth Management services.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning. David, you made an interesting comment about when you were asked about the pipelines that it takes a little while for the potential issue is to realize that they need to reset maybe their expectations. In your experience, how long does it take -- assuming markets don't come roaring back, and I'd say they stay below they were maybe 6 months or 12 months ago, how long does it take for that reset to finally say, okay, yes, we still need to raise the capital, even though it's at lower levels than we originally would have liked?\nDavid Solomon: Yes, I think, Gerard, it's a hard question to answer very specifically and some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business that's making those decisions is under. But I think if you want me to make a very generic generalization, these are not things it doesn't take a year for people's mindset around the reality of markets to reset. It's more something that happens real time over months or quarters.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up to another comment you made, you talked about how the global capital markets today versus five years ago are much larger, which obviously we have seen. How much of an impact do you think the quantitative easing by the global central banks? Because I think now it's over $30 trillion of those balance sheets that are outstanding. We all know the US Fed is that $9 trillion, up from $4 trillion at the start of the pandemic. When we go into QT in the US at least, they're going to bring those balances down. What kind of effect -- any color on what you think may happen versus what happened over the past five years when those balances blew out?\nDavid Solomon: Well, there's no question that -- and I've tried to say it in different ways, and there's no science to this. And no one knows obviously, where the macro environment goes as we go forward. But when you look at the volumes and the levels of 2020 and 2021, we've said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reflection of some of that monetary fiscal policy. That doesn't mean when you contract the monetary and fiscal policy that these businesses go away and contract proportionately. I think these are big businesses. There\u2019s a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and financing that will continue to go on. But there's no question, it's not going to operate at the levels that we saw in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJim Mitchell: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just talk about the bank a little bit. You've kind of stealthily grown the US bank to be sort of almost a top 10 player. I appreciate some of the color around the loan book and its rate sensitivity, but the bank balance sheet is almost three to four times the size of the loan book. So can we -- can you give us some sense of how we should think about asset sensitivity in a rising rate environment in the bank? And if there's -- we'd like to think that there's some material upside there given the size of the bank?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. Thank you for the question and to help through that. I think there's a couple of thing that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle. On the one hand, we do expect to continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity, that is modestly asset sensitive. So when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest-earning assets given the forward curve, we think that will be a benefit to the firm. The other thing that I should mention, which is separate, but probably also important just to be clear on and that is, in the past, we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the roll-off of fee waivers may have on the forward. I would just point out that in the first quarter, we had fee waivers of about $80 million versus in the fourth quarter was about $150 million. And on the forward, we expect those to be negligible. So, that too, obviously only a one-time benefit with the first hike, but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well.\nDenis Coleman: I'd also to highlight -- I'm sorry, Jim. I'd also just highlight that we continue to grow deposits, and deposits are important for funding. So, our bank has many activities across the firm. And obviously, we're growing our lending businesses. But this strategy also affects our market businesses positively too.\nJim Mitchell: No, absolutely. I just -- I'm trying to think through ex the market's NII, which obviously tends to be liability sensitive. But if we just think about the bank, the loan book you've disclosed, I think, within the bank, something like $800 million to $900 million from a 100 basis point move, is it at least fair to say that the bank in total would NII benefit from a 100 basis point move would be better or worse. Just trying to get -- think through the other parts of the balance sheet and how that NII can react and what that growth could look like if there's a way to frame that?\nDavid Solomon: Yeah. Look, I think I would just refocus you on my comments previously. Overall, NII sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive, I think, just given the relative size, even though we've grown it substantially, given our relative size, relative to some of our larger competitors. And I think that proxy that I offer you on behalf of the firm is a good way of thinking about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first of all, can we talk about your management of the efficiency ratio? Last year, it seems to be more volatile than usual. I guess, in the first three quarters, it ran at quite a low level. And then in the fourth quarter, it seems like you had some, kind of, like cost true-up both for compensation, but also for non-comp. I was wondering if we should expect the same thing again for this year, the first three quarters running at a lower level and then the fourth quarter being higher. And then what would you guide to really for the full year as a whole?\nDenis Coleman: Okay. Thanks very much for the question, Andrew. I think as David indicated, from an overall framing perspective on firm-wide operating expenses, we have put out this efficiency target of approximately 60%, and that is a target and a lens through, which we look at the combined set of expenses, compensation and non-compensation. The compensation level that we set for the first quarter, obviously, our best estimate right now based on what we pay for the full year, but I could not predict for you at this point, what our full year compensation ratio will be. That will be a function of our performance, the competitive landscape and our attention to the overall efficiency level efficiency ratio. On the non-comp side we\u2019re making decisions and taking steps to manage non-comp growth where we can make the types of investments that we think are important strategic investments for the long-term strength and growth of the firm like in areas such as technology and trying to manage other non-compensation expenses that are less strategic.\nAndrew Lim: Great. Thanks. And then just switching type as a follow-up question. You seem to be a leader in the crypto and blockchain space, it's been a few years coming now for banks to try and get some products off the ground. But maybe this year, you might see something a bit more material. So I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what we could expect maybe this year in terms of your product pipeline and what could be commercialized in the crypto and blockchain space?\nDavid Solomon: Well, at a high level, Andrew, what I'd say is we're certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space. But in terms of our product offering and what we can do, we're really following a regulatory lead. But at the moment, the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is very restrictive and very, very small. I don't have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of 2022, but we're engaged in dialogue with our clients. And certainly, when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure, payment systems and other activities in the financial markets, we're extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how Goldman Sachs participates in that and how that will affect different business channels and business opportunities because that's to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency -- clients' interest in cryptocurrency.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: Great. Thanks, Erica. Since there are no more questions, we'd like to thank everyone for joining the call. And if you do have other questions, they come up throughout the day, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or others on the Investor Relations team. Thank you very much. .\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Carey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us this morning. There's no question the first quarter was extremely volatile. Russia invaded Ukraine, inflation rose across the globe, and we saw an accelerating trend towards de-globalization. In recent decades, we've grown used to low inflation, low interest rates and the free flow of people and goods across national borders. I believe we're entering a period that won't be -- that won't be the case and the consequences for financial markets will be meaningful. Although, much remains uncertain, I'm proud that Goldman Sachs effectively supported its clients in this type of environment. This is a testament to the progress we've made to center our strategy around clients. At a time of great volatility it was clear, our clients needed help managing their risk, and they turn to us for our expertise in navigating this changing landscape. The recent turbulence is nothing to change our firm's client-oriented strategy. In fact, it makes it all the more imperative. We are building a more resilient, diversified franchise that can generate solid returns even in more uncertain markets. In February, I laid out our revised medium-term return targets. I'm very proud that even with the headwinds we faced; our results this quarter meet those objectives. We are also well positioned to achieve the targets we laid out for our growth initiatives across asset management, wealth management, transaction banking and consumer. In some areas, we have accelerated our progress with the acquisitions, including GreenSky, which closed in late March; and NNIP, which closed earlier this week. I'm thrilled to be welcoming these great businesses to Goldman Sachs. For the quarter, we produced net revenues of $12.9 billion, generated earnings per share of $10.76, an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%. As I noted, the evolving market backdrop had a significant effect on client activity. This meant that some parts of our firm faced significant headwinds, like equity capital markets, where issuance volumes were lackluster for the quarter. On the other hand, Global Markets had a strong quarter, as this environment allowed us to support clients in the risk intermediation and financing needs. And in line with our strategy, several of our growth areas continue to reflect durability despite the difficult environment. For example, we saw solid management and other fees across asset management, wealth management, as well as revenue growth in our consumer business. But there's no question that the most significant event of the first quarter was the invasion of Ukraine. As I've said before, we condemn the invasion in the strongest possible terms, and our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. This act of aggression demands a response that Goldman Sachs is committed to doing its part. Early on, we took action to ensure the well-being of our people and to begin winding down our firm's operations in Russia. That process is ongoing. Let me also say a few words on our direct financial exposure to Russia. Our positions were relatively limited, but we've been focused on closing them out and reducing our exposure. The overall direct financial impact from Russia and Ukraine related instruments on our first quarter revenues was a net loss of approximately $300 million. Our risk mitigation efforts would not have been possible without the close collaboration of our people around the globe on both the business and the control side of our firm. Our risk management culture is a true differentiator for us, and we continue to navigate - as we continue to navigate this volatile environment. More broadly, the Russian invasion has further complicated the geopolitical landscape and created an additional level of uncertainty that I expect will outlast the war itself. While it is encouraging to see a newfound unity among the Western democracies, the trend towards deglobalization is clearly gaining momentum. The consequences of that shift are likely to be significant and long lasting, and I believe it will take some time to fully appreciate all the second and third [order] (ph) ramifications. Beyond geopolitics, I'm keeping a close eye on several other trends. While US unemployment levels are low and wages are increasing, inflation is the highest it's been in decades. We're seeing new stress on supply chain and commodity prices and US households are facing rising gas prices as well as higher prices for food and housing. We've also seen an increased risk of stagflation and mixed signals on consumer confidence. These cross currents will certainly create ongoing complexity in the economic outlook, but whatever the future holds, I believe Goldman Sachs is well positioned. We continue to make progress on our growth strategy and our commitments to clients a strong -- our commitment to clients is stronger than ever. I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Sure, Glenn, it's David. And I'll jump in here. I would say that there are a variety of secular tailwinds that are still driving lots of institutional capital on a global basis towards broad alternatives platforms. I think despite the volatility that exists in markets, those trends continue to be in place. And I think you'll continue to see secular growth in the amount of capital, institutional capital that's allocated to alternatives platforms for quite some time. In the context of that, I think we and others do have big broad multi-product, global platforms that are well-positioned. And so while the pace of fundraising might ebb and flow a little bit from peaks, I think the general secular trend is still in place in this volatility. I don't think in the short run will affect that. With respect to monetizations and values, there is no question that we've gone through a period of time where the macro backdrop certainly created an acceleration of that. There were a variety of factors that I think were more short-term than amplified that. And I think we've commented in the past about the fact that we did not think that was levels of activity were sustainable. However, even in an environment like this, when you have a broad diversified portfolio of assets, and there are certainly lots of areas where there's real growth in the economy, and the economy is still growing very well, the opportunity to see monetizations, to see transactions, I think, continues just probably not at the same pace and velocity as we saw in 2020 and 2021. Well, I mean, I -- always is a definitive word. We never say always to anything because there certainly could be environments that we do not foresee that could produce the distribution of outcomes, a very skewed outcome in one direction or the other. I do think that this leadership team over the last almost four years has made significant investments in our business and that has allowed us to grow our business, and that has allowed us to better plan in our business given some of the investments and planning process we made that hopefully, over time, will give the market more confidence in the durability of these returns. I think we're well-positioned. In February, we laid out these medium-term targets. We do not lay out targets lightly. So I would never comment on what could happen in any given quarter, Christian, but I think we have a larger more durable business, and I think we're going to continue to add to that durability as we move forward, and we're very committed to executing on that strategy. So I mean, I comment from a macro perspective on a couple of things with respect to that. And I'm not smart enough to know what good volatility or bad volatility is. We're more focused on serving our clients and ensuring that we have the highest market share available with those clients as they position their portfolios that they transact. Intermediation is a big business. I think it's always going to be a big business. That doesn't mean that it can't ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter. But I think that one way to frame this is that the size of the available intermediation activity that's out there for firms like ourselves that play a big role in this is bigger today than it was five years ago, going back pre-pandemic. And in addition, based on investments we've made both in the client centricity and the approach we're taking and in technology, our market shares are larger, and we think those market share gains are durable. I'd also highlight that we've been -- and we've been very clear with you on this, building our financing capability for those clients and one of the things about that business now is a larger proportion of it is financing revenue and that financing revenue is more durable. So I feel good about the way the business is positioned. I won't speculate on what every quarter will look like going forward. But certainly, I think, we're better positioned in this business today than we were five years ago. And I think that's reflected, for example, in a quarter like this and the results of the client activity we're able to accomplish. So I'll start, Steve, and just say that, that activity level is still quite high and engagement from our banking clients is still quite high. There's no question that equity beta kind of turned off for the quarter. And so one of the things that happened was a bunch of equity issuance that was supposed to happen in the quarter got pushed out. That definitely is a market volatility effect. And my guess is as the market volatility settles down during the course of the year to the degree that it does, that will bring some of that issuance back into the marketplace. We've seen when you look over the course of the last 20 years, plenty of periods of time where there are quarters where you have very, very low equity issuance, it's been very rare that, that continues for a year or a longer period and that doesn't mean that, that couldn't happen, but certainly that would be expected given the history. As businesses need capital, they need to make investments at a time as prices reset or values reset, people need some time to absorb those changes versus their expectations. But ultimately, at the end of the day, they understand the reality and they move forward. I don't see a significant change in kind of strategic dialogue. I would say if the world got materially worse and materially more volatile given some of the geopolitical stuff that was going on, that certainly would have the potential to slow down some of the strategic activity and dialogue, but at the moment that activity level and certainly the engagement remains quite good, quite robust. But we watch it very, very closely. I would note that I think it's important to just recognize and we said this at the year-end, at year-end on the year-end call that the activity levels that we saw in 2021 in the banking business, nobody expected those to be normalized levels. So I'd certainly describe a little bit of what we're seeing as a normalization. And I think first quarter overall activity, there's some normalization of that, although, I think equity is well below what I would call a normalized trend. Good morning. So, Mike, I don't -- it's \u2013 and I know I just used it myself, I use the term normalization. We're talking about the equity capital markets business. It's very easy for me to look at equity capital markets revenues for the quarter and say, that's not a normalized run rate level for that business. I would also tell you that the equity capital markets revenues in the first quarter of 2021 was not a normal level for the business.  When you talk about the broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and end markets, again, I would amplify I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you exactly where it's going to settle out, but I think these are good businesses, where we have a high degree of confidence that through market cycles, we can produce very nice returns in these businesses.  We think it's a very powerful ecosystem combining these two businesses together with the global scale and footprint that we have. And we expect them to continue to be big contributors to accretive returns to allow us to meet our targets broadly. Commodities was not a record. There's no question that when you look at the FICC macro business where there was really great performance, it was well diversified across rates, commodities and currencies. I mean the macro businesses certainly outperformed. But that's what I'd say to that point.  So again, I'd go back, I think these businesses are in terms of available wallet for people like ourselves that compete in them they are fundamentally bigger than they were five years ago because the market cap growth around the world and that creates a good opportunity for us in addition we continue to invest in things in those businesses, which we think strengthen our competitive position. but it's hard for me to give you a predicted normal revenue number, it's just not that kind of business. Sure. I mean we -- I'll point out something that I think is an anecdotal metric, but I think it's interesting. We have 100 -- when you open the M&A lead table, which is something obviously we dominate, we have $155 billion lead for the quarter. That's the largest one quarter lead we've ever had in our history in the M&A lead table. So that's a metric that's reflective of clients coming to us. We're tracking our market shares quite closely across investment banking and also across global markets. And we've seen market share gains across both over the course of the last couple of years, and we'll continue to track them and make investments where we think we can strengthen them to make sure they're very durable. So in terms of our strategy, we would expect over time that as GreenSky continues to originate, we would take those loans onto our balance sheet. We certainly would retain the flexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously. But the goal over time is to ramp up those balances onto our balance sheet. I think they had origination volumes of approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter. And so, we're stepping into them based on that level of activity, and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them. The only thing I would add to that, Devin, is I just highlight back in the February update, we put out a $4 billion revenue target. And I just want to tie that target to what Denis said when he said most of the investment was made. Most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so that's something I want to amplify. And then just finally, because you referenced it, our partnership with Apple is very, very strong. While there's been a Bloomberg article about what Apple is doing Apple or we have -- have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time, and I would just say we're very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership. Well, as we've said always, we're a pay-for-performance culture. This is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the first quarter. We manage this very closely. We're comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively. And we will also obviously pay for performance. So I'm not going to speculate going forward, but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time. And we obviously -- the one thing I'd just highlight is our focus on our efficiency ratio, and that's something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to the efficiency ratio. And so that also affects our decision-making as we move forward. Sure and I appreciate the question, Dan. I mean I would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition, but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in Europe. It opens that some interesting distribution channel, and it accelerates some of our capabilities around ESG-oriented products. So, it was a good step forward to expand that growth. I believe -- Carey will correct me if I'm wrong, it's the fifth largest active asset manager in the world at the moment. We see opportunity based on our footprint, our global position, our client mix, our strong position and alternative to continue to grow that business, both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with NN, and so we're going to continue to strengthen our position there, but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities and alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the firm. Well, you can see from our earnings, the growth of the wealth business year-over-year. We continue to be focused on that opportunity. And I'd just highlight that that's a process that takes time. You add wealth advisers, you add footprint. It's a slower growth -- it's a slower process if you do it organically. But we see it as a very big opportunity. I think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space. It's only been the last couple of years first with the United Capital acquisition and also to our AECO channel, we're meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that we've been focused on really broadening that footprint. I think we're off to a good start there, but I think there's a lot of organic opportunity to still exist I think our Ayco channel, Goldman Sachs Ayco is a very, very unique platform to work through corporations. And I do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping our employees with Wealth Management services. Yes, I think, Gerard, it's a hard question to answer very specifically and some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business that's making those decisions is under. But I think if you want me to make a very generic generalization, these are not things it doesn't take a year for people's mindset around the reality of markets to reset. It's more something that happens real time over months or quarters. Well, there's no question that -- and I've tried to say it in different ways, and there's no science to this. And no one knows obviously, where the macro environment goes as we go forward. But when you look at the volumes and the levels of 2020 and 2021, we've said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reflection of some of that monetary fiscal policy. That doesn't mean when you contract the monetary and fiscal policy that these businesses go away and contract proportionately. I think these are big businesses. There's a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and financing that will continue to go on. But there's no question, it's not going to operate at the levels that we saw in 2021. Sure. Thank you for the question and to help through that. I think there's a couple of thing that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle. On the one hand, we do expect to continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity, that is modestly asset sensitive. So when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest-earning assets given the forward curve, we think that will be a benefit to the firm. The other thing that I should mention, which is separate, but probably also important just to be clear on and that is, in the past, we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the roll-off of fee waivers may have on the forward. I would just point out that in the first quarter, we had fee waivers of about $80 million versus in the fourth quarter was about $150 million. And on the forward, we expect those to be negligible. So, that too, obviously only a one-time benefit with the first hike, but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well. Yeah. Look, I think I would just refocus you on my comments previously. Overall, NII sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive, I think, just given the relative size, even though we've grown it substantially, given our relative size, relative to some of our larger competitors. And I think that proxy that I offer you on behalf of the firm is a good way of thinking about it. Well, at a high level, Andrew, what I'd say is we're certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space. But in terms of our product offering and what we can do, we're really following a regulatory lead. But at the moment, the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is very restrictive and very, very small. I don't have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of 2022, but we're engaged in dialogue with our clients. And certainly, when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure, payment systems and other activities in the financial markets, we're extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how Goldman Sachs participates in that and how that will affect different business channels and business opportunities because that's to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency -- clients' interest in cryptocurrency."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.9 billion and net earnings of $3.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $10.76. As David noted, firm-wide performance was strong with an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%, notwithstanding an operating environment that was significantly less favorable than the prior year. Turning to performance by segment starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.4 billion. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, as our M&A franchise continued its outstanding performance and client dialogue remain significantly elevated. In the quarter, we closed over 115 deals for approximately $385 billion of deal volume and maintained our number one league table position with nearly $360 billion in announced transactions. This was roughly $155 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, the largest quarterly lead in our history as a public firm. In equity underwriting, net revenues were $261 million, down significantly versus a record performance in the first quarter of 2021 on the lower industry issuance volumes that David mentioned. Despite this, we continue to rank number one year-to-date in equity and equity-related offerings with volume market share of 8%. Debt underwriting net revenues were $743 million, 16% lower versus the prior year, driven by lower results in leveraged finance and asset-backed activity. While transactions have slowed from the elevated pace of last year and deals have been pushed out, given the uncertain backdrop, our investment banking backlog remains robust. Client engagement is strong, catalyzed by secular trends like digital disruption and transformation across industries and future activity will likely be bolstered by high levels of investable capital from financial sponsors. Moving to Global Markets on page four. Segment net revenues were $7.9 billion in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. We saw exceptional strength in both our FICC and Equities businesses. On page five, you can see revenues across FICC were $4.7 billion in the first quarter, 21% higher than the strong results in the first quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $4 billion. This was driven by particular strength in our macro products with elevated activity across rates, currencies, and commodities. These macro businesses within FICC, which generally represent the preponderance of FICC intermediation revenues, benefit from a portfolio effect. Our diversified and global footprint, combined with our risk intermediation and execution capabilities is a key differentiator. FICC financing generated record revenues of $685 million, which were up 23% sequentially and 55% year-on-year with particular strength in mortgages. Total equities revenues were $3.1 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 16% year-over-year, driven by lower activity in both cash and derivatives due to fewer market-making opportunities compared to a very strong backdrop at the start of 2021. Equity financing produced net revenues of $988 million. Though lower on a year-on-year basis, these results were 21% higher sequentially. While average prime balances declined slightly from record levels at year-end, opportunities to provide client liquidity increased, which drove stronger quarterly performance. Moving to Asset Management on page six, first quarter revenues were $546 million, materially lower than the first quarter of last year due to market headwinds in equity investments and lending and debt investments. Management and other fees totaled $772 million, up 4% sequentially. Net revenues for equity investments were negative $360 our public and private portfolios, we experienced substantial losses tied to Russia-related positions, all of which have been written down to 0. More broadly, we experienced additional headwinds due to the overall market environment. All in, we experienced roughly $620 million of net losses in our public portfolio, offset by approximately $255 million in net gains across our private portfolio, largely due to event-driven items, including asset sales and financing rounds. We harvested $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments in the first quarter. We remain fully committed to reducing this portfolio over time and have line of sight on another $1 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to approximately $750 million of capital reduction. Turning to page nine, Consumer & Wealth Management produced revenues of $2.1 billion in the first quarter, up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. In Wealth Management, quarterly management and other fees were $1.3 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 on seasonality and counseling fees, but up 17% year-over-year. Private Banking and lending net revenues of $339 million were up 28% year-on-year, driven by higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $483 million in the first quarter, up 28% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. We continue to grow credit card loans and deposit balances. Next, on page 10. Across these two segments, total firm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion, with a quarterly decline, primarily driven by net market depreciation of $94 billion, partially offset by $24 billion of long-term net inflows. Combined firm-wide management and other fees for the first quarter rose 15% year-over-year to $2 billion, driven by higher average AUS versus last year. On page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the first quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting higher loan balances and lower funding costs. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $166 billion, up $8 billion versus year-end 2021, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and credit cards. For the first quarter, our provision for credit losses was $561 million, up from $344 million in the fourth quarter. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to the growth in our lending portfolio as well as broader macroeconomic factors, including a slowing growth outlook. As we continue to expand our consumer business and grow our lending activities, we are cognizant that macro headwinds and inflationary pressures could potentially weigh on payment rates and thus portfolio performance. While we have not seen any meaningful signs of deterioration in credit metrics, we are being vigilant and will continue to monitor performance and macro conditions to assess risk mitigation measures and calibrate our underwriting where needed. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year. This drove an efficiency ratio for the quarter of 59.7%. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $3.6 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, driven by our continued investments, particularly in technology, that will further enhance our infrastructure and support our strategic growth initiatives. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.4% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of roughly $700 million. As it relates to the second quarter, we deployed capital to support the closing of the NNIP transaction, and we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. In conclusion, our strong first quarter results reflect the durability and resilience of our client franchise across almost any environment. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical complexity, we remain focused on executing on our strategic plan to diversify our business mix and drive competitive returns for shareholders, and we have significant confidence in our forward momentum as an organization. With that, we'll now open the line for questions. So Glenn, it's Denis. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Obviously, our results in the quarter in terms of RoTE of 15.8% and ROE was 15%. Our medium-term targets that you referenced were to be achieved by 2024. So we're really pleased with the performance in this quarter. As it relates to SCB, for us, it continues to be making the choices that we can with respect to investing in our business mix, creating more durable and predictable revenue streams, and then also continuing to migrate down our on-balance sheet equity position. So I think our commitment to the strategy remains intact. We have, obviously, submitted our CCAR submission, and we await response from the Federal Reserve. And we will continue to focus on driving those aspects of our business that we can, all of which we hope will contribute to an SCB that is lower and reflects our business mix. Sure, Steven. Thank you for the question. As it relates to our build of capital over the course of the quarter, that was deliberate. We knew that at the beginning of the second quarter that we would have to pay for the NNIP acquisition. And so we had -- we've grown our capital over the course of the first quarter. We also were very disciplined on RWA growth. Our growth was $5 billion on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we were able to deliver types of results that David just made reference to across our big businesses while maintaining a discipline with respect to RWA growth so that also contributed to the improvement. Now as it relates to our outlook, we've been reasonably clear that our first priority in terms of driving long-term results for shareholders and supporting clients is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities. And once again, you would see in the first quarter with the Global Markets segment ROE north of 25% and firm line ROE at 15%, there certainly were attractive client deployment opportunities, and we prioritized that. We remain focused on sustainably growing a dividend. And then obviously, to the extent the opportunities to support clients or the market environment shifts, obviously, we'd look to return that capital back to shareholders. I would say from where I sit right now, looking at the second quarter, my expectation on buybacks is to be reasonably consistent with the first quarter, but we do expect to remain nimble. And to the extent that the opportunity set with clients is less attractive and you make reference to the then prevailing share price, that's obviously something that we'll consider. Hi, Betsy. Thank you very much for the question. Look, we've been very focused on growing these businesses and whether it be loan growth across the consumer platform in terms of installment loan business or the cards businesses or now with the acquisition of GreenSky, or whether it be across private wealth channels or even across our FICC financing businesses, we have a strategic objective to continue to grow those businesses in a credit sensitive fashion. And in terms of thinking about the impact and how to think about that through the P&L, you'll see that in the first quarter, we did raise our provisions for credit losses. They were at 561 versus 344 and a primary driver of that was our growth in loan activity. So that's something that we expect across these businesses as we grow them. We expect as we grow the portfolio of GreenSky that will also continue to provision. So it remains focused for the firm. We're looking at across multiple channels and trying to keep in mind sort of underwriting credit quality as we do so. Sure. Fair enough. And that's a question we're very, very focused on. I mean, in terms of looking at the portfolio and its performance, we have not yet seen a change in the overall credit quality of our portfolios. We remain very mindful of that, given some of the headwinds that are on the forward, but if you look at metrics like our charge-offs in the first quarter, they were $154 million, net charge-off rate of 0.4% unchanged quarter-over-quarter.  And as we think about growing these particular businesses, underwriting standards and the credit box remain top of mind as we continue to grow. And to the extent we see indications significantly slowing rates in terms of payments or the percentage of people making their minimum payments that are indications of future credit deterioration, that will be a signal for us and we can obviously take risk mitigating actions in the forward as a result. Fair enough. You're right to observe that we have not increased our market savings rate. Look, in terms of how we're thinking about the deposit betas across the channels, I mean, that really -- you really need a through-the-cycle experience. We have a certain expectation for these businesses that will prove out through the cycle. This cycle will be different than previous cycles. Obviously, I would say at the very, very beginning part of the cycle, the experience is outperforming our expectations. But I think that's because we recognize that the maturity of our portfolio and our time in the business is less than some of our biggest competitors. But we remain really focused on managing that, continuing to drive deposit growth and support the other origination activities across our lending platforms. Okay. Great. Thank you for the question. So in terms of our aspirations to build the leading global digital consumer bank, a lot of the pieces to the puzzle are in place at this point. A lot of those investments have been made, and we feel really good about the progress across the various lending and deposit platforms that we've invested in and built out. I mean to give you a sense, our active customers in the consumer space are north of $13 million now. And that number in the fourth quarter was less than $10 million. So we continue to see attractive active customer acquisition, both organically and inorganically, which is an important piece of the strategy. I think perhaps next up on the product road map will be the launch of checking. We're already piloting that internally, and we expect to launch that more broadly to our clients later this year. And that will be -- I think that will be an important piece of the product road map for us. I'd also to highlight -- I'm sorry, Jim. I'd also just highlight that we continue to grow deposits, and deposits are important for funding. So, our bank has many activities across the firm. And obviously, we're growing our lending businesses. But this strategy also affects our market businesses positively too. Okay. Thanks very much for the question, Andrew. I think as David indicated, from an overall framing perspective on firm-wide operating expenses, we have put out this efficiency target of approximately 60%, and that is a target and a lens through, which we look at the combined set of expenses, compensation and non-compensation. The compensation level that we set for the first quarter, obviously, our best estimate right now based on what we pay for the full year, but I could not predict for you at this point, what our full year compensation ratio will be. That will be a function of our performance, the competitive landscape and our attention to the overall efficiency level efficiency ratio. On the non-comp side we're making decisions and taking steps to manage non-comp growth where we can make the types of investments that we think are important strategic investments for the long-term strength and growth of the firm like in areas such as technology and trying to manage other non-compensation expenses that are less strategic."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, January 16th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was a dynamic year. The US economy proved to be more resilient than expected, despite a number of headwinds to growth, including a significant tightening of financial conditions, regional bank failures, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, this was the year of execution for Goldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our strategic focus, we further strengthened our core businesses. As we enter 2024, the potential for rate cuts in the first half of this year has renewed optimism for a soft landing. We are already seeing signs of potential resurgence in strategic activity, which is reflected in our backlog. I am starting today's presentation with a strategic update, and Denis will provide comments on the financial results. Beginning on page one, we aspire to be the world's most exceptional financial institution, united by our shared value client service, partnership, integrity, and excellence. And over the last 155 years, we have created one of the most aspirational brands in financial services. Goldman Sachs is a preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management. We've continued to simplify our strategy, and today is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, as well as highlight avenues for further growth. Strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence and to further strengthen our client franchise. As we show on page two, we have two world-class and interconnected franchises that are well-positioned to achieve these strategic objectives. First, Global Banking & Markets, which includes our top rank investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and a leading capital markets business. It also includes our number one equities franchise and top three FICC franchise. We are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products. And second, our unified Asset & Wealth Management business where we are leading global active asset manager with a top five alternative business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise. This is a scaled business with over $2.8 trillion in assets under supervision and where we see significant opportunity for further growth. Across these two businesses, our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. On page three, we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent Investor Day in February 2023. Global Banking & Markets, we've maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking. In FICC and equities, we have improved our standing with the top 150 clients. We generated record total financing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years. In Asset & Wealth Management, we've driven solid investment performance and consistent growth in a more durable revenue base of management, other fees, and private banking and lending revenues. This past year, we reduced our historical principal investments by $13 billion, and also surpassed our five-year alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule. I will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment. Before I do, I would like to speak about how we've narrowed our strategic focus. We made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them. We exited the Marcus lending business and sold substantially all of our Marcus loan portfolio. We sold our Personal Financial Management business. We announced the sale of GreenSky, which remains on track to close this quarter. We also sold the majority of our GreenSky loan portfolio, which settled in the fourth quarter. We've also reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer. We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements and our consumer activities. I firmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth. But it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed. Our consumer ambitions have produced over $150 billion of deposits, which we expect to grow further from here. These deposits have materially improved the firm's funding profile. Now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win. We recognize that scale matters as it allows the firm to operate more efficiently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs, making unit economics more favorable. And we need to be measured and focused in our execution. Our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position, scale, and exceptional talent. On page four, in Global Banking & Markets, our leading and diversified franchise has produced average revenues of $32 billion over the last four years across a number of different market environments, demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate. In the last several years, we made a concerted effort to grow our wallet share and financing revenues, which have clearly raised the revenue floor for these businesses. We have also generated attractive returns with an average ROE fully allocated of over 16% over the last four years. Turning to page five, a key part of enhancing this durability has been executing on our strategic priorities. Our efforts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly 350 basis points since 2019. We've maintained our league table rankings of number one in announced and completed M&A, number one in equity and equity-related underwriting, number two in high yield debt. In FICC and equities, we're in the top three with 117 of our top 150 clients. These competitive positions are a reflection of our One Goldman Sachs approach and our clients' confidence in us. In addition, we have significantly increased more durable financing revenue. FICC and equity financing together have grown at a 15% CAGR since 2019 to a new record of nearly $8 billion. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management on page six. We've continued to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019. We've also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pre-tax margin target on an adjusted basis. Turning to page seven. Our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inflows. Over 75% of our traditional funds performed in the top half of Morningstar funds, while on alternatives, over 90% of our funds were in the top half of Cambridge funds, both over the last five years. The fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows across our platform. I want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over $250 billion in alternatives since 2019, surpassing our $225 billion target a year early. This fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation and developing new strategy, as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and longstanding track records. Fundraising has been broad-based across geographies and asset classes with approximately 40% coming from our ultra-high net worth relationships. I'm very proud of this achievement. When we were preparing for our first Investor Day four years ago, I remember how big a reach our initial target of $150 billion seemed. We\u2019ve surpassed not only that target, but also our increased target of $225 billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business. Putting all this together on page eight, you can see how much we've improved the durability of revenues across the firm. On this slide, baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represents the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical, namely advisory, underwriting, and intermediation. We believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In fact, in all of the years since we became a public company, it has never happened. In dark blue, you can see the more durable revenues from financing, management, and other fees, as well as private banking and lending, which in aggregate have grown at 13% CAGR since 2019. Taken together, these two components make up over 70% of revenues in 2023. On top of that, we consistently generate upside across different market environments because of our diversified franchise. The increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams, coupled with the diversification of our scaled franchise and our ability to capture upside, demonstrate the revenue-generating power of our firm. Narrowing our strategic focus, our leadership team spent a significant amount of time in 2023 realigning the firm's priorities with our strategic vision, our values, and our strengths, which we highlighted on page nine. You've heard us talk about many of these elements before, starting with our strategic objectives. First, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence. Second, to run world-class, differentiated, and durable businesses. Third, to invest and operate at scale. As you can see on the page, our execution focus areas for 2024 are aligned with these strategic objectives. Taking one example, investing in our people and culture. Exceptional quality of our people, supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problem, and it's imperative that we continue to invest in them. All in these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes, to continue to be a trusted advisor to our clients, to be an employer of choice for our people, and to generate mid-teens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return. With everything we achieved in 2023, coupled with our clear and simplified strategy, we have a much stronger platform for 2024. I feel very confident about the future of Goldman Sachs, our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence, and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let me start on page 10 of the presentation. In 2023, we generated net revenues of $46.3 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, and earnings per share of $22.87. As David highlighted, we made significant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions, as well as the impact of the FDIC special assessment fees on the slide. In aggregate, these items reduced full year net earnings by $2.8 billion, earnings per share by $8.04, and our ROE by 2.6 percentage points. Turning to performance by business, starting on page 12. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $30 billion for the year, down 8% as higher equities revenues were more than offset by a decline in FICC revenues and investment banking fees versus last year. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees of $1.7 billion fell 12% year-over-year, driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in 2022. For 2023, we maintained our number one league table position in announced and completed M&A as well as in equity and equity-related underwriting and ranked second in high yield debt underwriting. Our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, driven by a significant increase in advisory. As David mentioned, we are encouraged by the robust level of dialogues with our corporate client base. And though we're only two weeks into the New Year, there have been solid levels of capital markets activity in both the US and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2 billion in the quarter, down 24% from strong performance last year, amid lower activity in rates and other macro products. In FICC financing, revenues rose to a record $739 million. Equities net revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-on-year. The year-over-year increase in intermediation revenues was driven by better results in derivatives. Financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose year-over-year with continued strength on higher average balances. Across FICC and equities, financing revenues rose 10% in 2023, consistent with our priority to grow client financing. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 14. For 2023, revenues of $13.9 billion rose 4% year-over-year, as an increase in more durable revenues, including record management and other fees and record private banking and lending revenues, offset a decline in equity investments revenues and incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.4 billion were up 9% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $9.5 billion, putting us on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024, notwithstanding the sale of our PFM business. Equity investments produced net revenues of $838 million, higher year-over-year, driven by modest gains in our public portfolio versus losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Results in this line item also included a gain of $349 million from the sale of PFM. Moving on to page 15. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and alternative assets, and representing our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. Turning to page 16 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $295 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $571 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, surpassing our $2 billion target for 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $32 billion for the quarter and $72 billion for the year. As David mentioned, third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day now stands at over $250 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $46 billion, of which roughly $16 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $4 billion, including sales of $3 billion of CIEs across over 40 positions, bringing reductions for the year to $13 billion. We continue to focus on exiting this portfolio over the medium-term, though we don't expect portfolio reductions in 2024 to be at the same pace as in 2023. I'll now turn to platform solutions on page 17. Full year revenues were $2.4 billion, up 58% versus 2022. Quarterly net revenues of $577 million were up 12% year-over-year on higher consumer platform results amid growth in average credit card balances. As David mentioned, we reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer, the impact of which was to move the loans to held for sale and release the associated loan loss reserves of approximately $160 million. We have no additional updates regarding our credit card partnerships at this time. On page 18, firm-wide net interest income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter was down 13% relative to the third quarter, reflecting an increase in funding costs supporting trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $183 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting an increase in other collateralized lending, which includes the pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities we won at auction in October. Our provision for credit losses was $577 million. In relation to our consumer portfolio, provisions were driven by net charge-offs and seasonal balance growth, partially offset by the GM reserve release I mentioned. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments that were generally in line with the last two quarters, with roughly half related to CRE. Let's turn to expenses on page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $34.5 billion, excluding severance-related costs of $310 million, compensation expense was flat year-over-year, amid solid core performance, and as the market for talent remains competitive. As of the fourth quarter, we achieved our goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies, which allowed us to continue investing in our talent. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion, and included CIE impairments of $262 million. The year-over-year increase in non-comp expenses was driven by the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was 20.7%. For 2024, we expect a tax rate of 22% to 23%. Turning to capital on slide 21. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.5% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, 150 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion at an average price of $311 and common stock dividends of $922 million. While we expect to remain nimble with respect to capital return, given the ongoing uncertainty around the Basel III proposed rule, our capital management philosophy is unchanged. We prioritize supporting client deployment opportunities, sustainably growing our dividend, and returning excess to shareholders in the form of buybacks, particularly when valuation levels are attractive. In conclusion, we made solid progress on narrowing our strategic focus in 2023 with our execution driving a much stronger platform for 2024. Our best-in-class core businesses are well-positioned to execute on our strategic objectives. We will continue to Harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence, run world-class differentiated and durable businesses, and invest to operate our businesses at scale. Additionally, the execution focus areas we've identified for 2024 will help us drive the outcomes of delivering for clients, our people, and our shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. So I wanted to get a mark-to-market. You've been rightfully cautious but optimistic on green shoots becoming reality in investment banking. You definitely saw some momentum in the fourth quarter. So curious -- and you mentioned that the pipeline is up quarter-on-quarter. So maybe just differentiate between what you're seeing on the corporate side versus sponsor side and just get the mark-to-market on how you're feeling. Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. Sure, Glenn. I mean, just at a base level, I'm pretty optimistic, given the way we've got the firm positioned. And there's no question that these capital markets and M&A activity levels have been depressed. As I've said before, I don't think that continues year-on-year-on year, and we really started to see, in the second half of this year, real improvement. As Denis highlighted, the M&A backlog saw a really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter. And I'd just highlight, and I know this is obvious, but I think it's worth stating, we put up $1 billion of M&A revenue. If the backlog is growing, that means we've got to replace the $1 billion that we put up, plus then have growth. And so, that's a very, very strong replenishment. And I would just say the level of strategic dialogue has definitely increased and we're seeing it across our platform. I'm encouraged by capital markets activity. I'm not going to say, it's running back to 10-year averages right away, but it has materially improved. I do think you're going to see some more meaningful IPOs in 2024. And we are just, across debt and equity issuance, seeing more activity, more engagement. At the end of the day, people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time, but they've got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market, and we're seeing that come through. So when I look broadly, it feels better. There's a lot going on in the world. And so I think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry 98% of the time about the 2% of things that can go wrong. So we're going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the firm, but I do think the firm is incredibly well-levered to this pickup, and it feels better is the way I'd frame it.\nGlenn Schorr: All right. Cool. Maybe just to follow-up on that note. Reducing the on-balance sheet investments, as you mentioned, is an important part of the ROE improvement for Asset & Wealth and for Goldman overall. So with that said, the markets are higher, pipeline's better. How come the balance sheet reduction of on-balance sheet investments might be slower this year when the intent, I think, is to get rid of all of it at the right price?\nDavid Solomon: Yeah, first of all, I think we made a lot of progress last year. And so if you look at what we accomplished, I think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful, especially given the environment. One of the things that happened is we pulled some stuff forward that we didn't expect to monetize in 2023 -- into 2023. And so to be clear, our focus is to get that to zero as quickly as possible. If you're operating inside this firm and you're operating in that business, you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible. But we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately. We set a clear target over the next three years to get to zero. My guess is, we've got a good shot if we executed doing that quicker than that.\nGlenn Schorr: Fair enough. All right, thanks, David.\nDavid Solomon: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I just wanted to spend some time on the FICC business. So if I'm looking at the right numbers, it feels like FICC revenues are now back to pre-COVID levels if you go back to 1Q of '19. Maybe if you can unpack it, just looking at slide 13, seemed like most products were quite weak. Give us some perspective around does both -- the intermediation piece of FICC, does that feel like we are close to trough, and unlike seasonality, we should see some improvement in FICC from here, if you can just provide some perspective there.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I mean, at a high level, what I would say, this quarter, intermediation activity was quiet, and particularly in the back half of the quarter, kind of late November and December, clients were quiet. If you look at the whole year, I don't think it's fair, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't think it's fair to say the whole year is back to '19 levels. The overall activity levels were up and down during the year. We have a big diversified business. When our clients are active, we execute on it, we continue to grow the financing revenues, which make it overall more durable. But it was a quiet quarter, particularly the back half, in terms of intermediation. I don't expect it to continue at that pace. I think Denis' comments in the opening, we're seeing more activity in the first few weeks of the year. But we'll watch it. And as you know, that activity, particularly in that segment, can move up and down based on what's going on in the macro environment.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And maybe just sticking to FICC or maybe both FICC and Equity. On the financing side, if you don't mind reminding us of the opportunity to grow financing over the next year or over the medium-term. Thank you.\nDenis Coleman: So, thanks, Ebrahim. So we've been clear over the last several years that we see opportunities to grow both FICC and equity financing. And it's a virtuous activity for us. It dovetails well with our focus on clients and our focus on market share. We have a lot of expertise in this space and we see a lot of demand from clients for us to deploy both into FICC and equities. We now have leading equities franchise overall. Our equities financing business is in a leadership position and at scale. It has grown significantly and we continue to see opportunities to increase the activities that we do with our existing clients and bring new clients on the platform. So we look out into 2024 and 2025. We continue to be very focused. I think there's good opportunities across both FICC and equity financing in GBM.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Mr. Hawken, please go ahead. Your line is open. Please check your mute function.\nBrennan Hawken: Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. So just curious about the impact that we should be thinking about around the potential exit from the Apple relationship. I know it's an ongoing thing, but maybe is there anything that you could provide that might help us think about how that impact could flow through?\nDavid Solomon: Denis said in his comments, we've got no other updates on the credit card partnerships other than what he stated. We continue to work with Apple on a partnership with them to serve our customers and to continue to reduce the drag from the partnership, and we continue to make good progress. And the drag in 2024 will be materially less.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Appreciate that. And then when you think about the deposit platform, Marcus, that's been a pretty bright spot on the consumer front and definitely seems to have worked well. What has been your views or how has the beta on that deposit base played out versus your expectations? And do you have any plans to adjust your thoughts around, you know, earlier you talked about wanting to be in the top decile of payouts for that product. Is that still the goal or has that adjusted as the platform has matured?\nDenis Coleman: Sure, Brennan, and thank you for that question. Our Marcus, deposit platform, has been a real strategic advantage to us in terms of overall firm-wide funding. We did set out a strategy to set our pricing at the higher-end of the pricing envelope to maintain, sustain, and grow our balances across that platform. We haven't adjusted our strategy at this point. We saw good growth across our various strategic deposit funding channels last year, not just Marcus. Overall, deposits are up over $40 billion on the year. And I would just say, as we move into 2024, we continue to focus on driving growth across the strategic channels and be thoughtful about our overall funding mix.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hey, David. You started off the call saying that 2023 was the year of execution and that's the year when you had an ROE of 8%, and if we throw in some of the charges, it's 10%, and that's not really executing at your 15% or so desired return. So can you give us a kind of waterfall chart in words on how you get from that core 10% ROE to 15%, and if you could define medium-term?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So I appreciate the question, Mike, and obviously, we're very focused on it. It wasn't an A environment for our core business. In fact, I don't even think it was a B environment. When investment banking is operating at low levels, that is an impact overall. I do think that it's important to look at our core business of banking and markets, which is a very significant portion of the firm and do note, on a fully allocated basis in this environment, which was not a B-plus or an A environment, given the investment banking activity, it had a 12% ROE. We continue to believe through the cycle that that business is a mid-teens business. And so I don't think we're going to see -- stay at the level of activities that we've been at. We have that business positioned very well. And so you'll get some upside returns there in a better environment. And then secondarily, on Asset & Wealth Management, we continue to reduce the balance sheet. The balance sheet has been a drag on returns, but I think we've been pretty clear that we can drive the Asset & Wealth Management with a smaller balance sheet to mid-teens returns or better with a 25% margin. We're on that journey. We're making progress. I think we'll make very good progress over the next two years. And if you look at those two businesses, that's the vast, vast majority of the firm, and I think they can operate mid-teens. We've significantly reduced the other drags. We got a lot of it behind us in this year. That doesn't mean there won't be anything, but the drag from platforms in 2024 will be materially reduced from what it's been. And so I think we're making good progress in the medium-term is over the next couple of years, provided it's -- provided that it's a reasonable environment. And so I think you'll see good progress on the overall positioning of the firm over the next three to five years.\nMike Mayo: And then just to follow-up that other drag, you said would be a lot less than 2024 from Platform Solutions. And can you dimension that a little bit? And also, as it relates to principal investments, do the higher stock markets help the disposition or not so much?\nDavid Solomon: They absolutely do. I mean, when markets improve, they help the disposition. There's no question. I also -- when you look at the last two years, we've had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that, but on a much smaller balance sheet in 2024. With a better market, you actually might have some benefit to revenue performance, but we're focused on reducing that broadly. You see you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on GreenSky, move GM to held for sale. And so you have more transparency on that. We think the drag will be significantly reduced in 2024. When we're comfortable providing more specific color on that, we will provide it.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: But small in the overall context of the firm and the firm's performance.\nDenis Coleman: Yeah.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks so much. Morning, David and Denis. Question just on kind of interplay between a recovery in investment banking versus trading intermediation. And I know there's probably a lot of assumptions that need to go in here. But if you think about kind of the environment with macro conditions settling down, which would likely support investment banking, I'm assuming some areas of trading could also slow down and then maybe other areas could pick up as well. So just love to maybe hear a little bit about kind of the puts and takes, kind of what you've seen historically there, if easier. And just really kind of the key question is, just whether you can grow investment banking revenues and trading ex-financing at the same time. Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Yeah, so at a high level, Devin, appreciate the question. I think we can continue to grow our financing activity given the scale and the size of the market, the way market activity is growing, and we will normalize investment banking activity. And obviously, over time, given our position, and if you assume growth in the world, growth in market capital world, we will continue, as we have for the last 25, 35 years, grow our investment banking activity. When there's real disruption in the world, we find that FICC can be a little bit countercyclical in some way, shape or form. But that's not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation or market activity. I think there's a lot going on in the world. The trajectory of rates, there's a point of view on rates and inflation, but it's certainly not certain to me. I think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment. There's debates about how the Fed continues on its quantitative tightening or doesn't continue on its quantitative tightening. And so all of this, I think, will continue to play into people being active in markets. So I do think just at a high level, look, this is a high level. I think the environment in 2024 feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in 2023. But I'm not a good predictor, and we're prepared to operate whatever environment we have to operate in.\nDevin Ryan: Understood. I appreciate that, David. Maybe a quick follow up for Denis. Just commercial real estate, clearly big headwind in 2023. Appreciate all the disclosure. Their office on-balance sheet is only $1 billion now. So when you think about just the environment relative to current marks, how do you feel about kind of the pain being behind the Company and just characterize the environment where maybe there still could be material marks? And then just more broadly kind of expectations for marks as you exit the historical CRE on-balance sheet principal investments. Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Sure, Devin. Thank you. And as you know, we have new disclosure the last couple of quarters on CRE in particular on the nature of the loans in that sector. And then as well as the on-balance sheet, both CRE and office in particular. You can obviously see from those disclosures, we've made substantial progress moving down the positions over the course of 2023, gave disclosure on the number of CIE positions that we moved down recently, and we've made really significant progress. We disclosed on prior calls and our office exposures from an impairment and marks perspective, we're sitting at roughly 50%. So we think that based on the visibility that we had and the activity that we had over the course of 2023 that that portfolio, and the broader portfolio for that matter, sits at the right place. As we move into 2024, there should be opportunities for further dispositions and we'll remain very focused on what the mix of that disposition activity is. When David was reviewing our expectations with respect to HPI sell-down on the forward, in addition to moving towards our medium-term target, we're also mindful of what the long-term franchise impact of those sell-down activities are. So just to give you a sense for why we may have cautioned on pace, we have some meaningful credit exposures where we enjoy a position of incumbency. And for the long-term benefit of the franchise, we very much hope that we'll remain as a lender and a supporter of those clients to exit those positions in advance of a potential refinancing would be to surrender our incumbency position. And so we're being thoughtful so that we can continue to reduce our risk while continuing to grow the third-party fund management business while supporting clients in the process.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley.\nRyan Kenny: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So you highlighted in the prepared remarks that Goldman surpassed your fundraising target in alternatives. And so as we look forward, can you give some more color on your strategy to grow, particularly in private credit? Any update on how big you expect to get in private credit, how it complements your DCM and wealth franchises, and maybe any risks that we should be thinking about would be helpful? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Appreciate the question. It's, obviously, something, Ryan, we're very, very focused on. We feel good about the fundraising progress we've made. I think when you look forward in 2024, you could expect us to raise another $40 billion to $50 billion of alternatives. We're, obviously, very focused on private credit. We do operate at scale on private credit. We have over $110 billion of private credit. But I think the opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale on private credit, especially given the way our franchise is positioned and the origination connection we have with our broad banking business gives us a unique platform and a unique competitive advantage. So we're going to continue to keep this focus. It doesn't stop because we met our goal. Our goal was meant to flame the opportunity set three-and-a-half years ago, but you'll see us continue to raise money on a year-to-year basis. And we've got some big funds that we're going to be in the market with in 2024, and we'll continue to build the partnerships with that client base. And both myself, John Waldron, and the broad team across our Asset Management division are spending a lot of time with the big capital allocators all over the world and continuing to invest in those relationships.\nRyan Kenny: And then Basel endgame comment letters are due today. So now that you and other GSIBs have had time to digest the proposal, could you give us an update on how Goldman might plan to adapt if the potential final rule comes through and how the proposal is written might impact your 15% to 17% through the cycle RoTCE target?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Well, obviously, today marks the end of the comment period, and what I would say, it's certainly not the end of the process. In fact, I would say, it's the end of the beginning of the process. And so we're moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders, given our significant concern with the proposed rules. You'll see comment letters from us, from our peers. You'll also see many letters from end users, including pension funds, insurance companies, corporates who are particularly concerned about how this rule could affect their access to capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risks in their business. And I think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry, and also I think disadvantages the US from a competitive perspective. So to be clear, my view is the rule was not proposed appropriately and it should be withdrawn and reproposed. I don't think speculating on the impact of the rule as proposed, I think there's a pretty significant view out there that the Fed is listening carefully, they're taking in the feedback, and I don't think there's anyone that's looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed. We're very flexible with our capital, as I've said before. If the rules put certain changes in place, we'll also adjust businesses or pricing in businesses and certain activity to adapt. I think to speculate as to how we'll talk about this once it's in place before we have any idea what the rule is going to look like is premature. But we've got a lot of capital flexibility and we've proven over time we can be particularly nimble. And so we'll continue to focus.\nRyan Kenny: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. As you think about your efficiency targets, what's a reasonable level of growth for non-comp expenses as we, excluding, obviously, all the one-timers this year? And maybe what the areas of investment are or priorities when you think about 2024?\nDenis Coleman: Thanks, Dan. So the efficiency ratio is something we are laser focused on. We continue to orient the firm to drive towards our 60% target. You mentioned the impact of selected items. If you take the impact over the course of 2023, the efficiency ratio would have been more like 65%. That's, obviously, not where we want it to be, but significantly better than the fully reported number. We have a number of initiatives across the firm to get after our non-compensation expense. We had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efficiency targets at the end of last year, rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year. There is a -- we have a ton of different categories. We're in the process of reviewing each and every category of our non-compensation expense, benchmarking it, reviewing KPIs, thinking about our processes, incentive structures, governance, things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efficiently as possible. We do see an impact of inflation across these activities, and it's for that reason, that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible. I think as we look into 2024, if you take a look at the disclosure round selected items, we don't expect those types of activities to repeat, and we'll be very, very -- remain very, very focused on maintaining our overall non-comp expense spend. And the other component of the efficiency ratio is, obviously, compensation expense. You saw that over the course of this year, we maintained our pay for performance orientation with respect to how we size that, and you should expect the same on the forward into 2024, that is obviously a performance-based and variable component of our overall expense. There are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable. Our largest items, both compensation as well as transaction expenses, are variable. So we will have to see how the types of activities unfold into 2024 and what the mix of our activities are to, ultimately, determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efficiency ratio.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you. And follow-up on Wealth Management, you disclosed 40% of the alternative inflows since 2019 have come from the wealth channel. Curious if that was consistent throughout that time period and whether you view that level of contribution as sustainable. And also just the economics to Goldman Sachs, how it differs between that 40% in wealth and the 60% externally. How does that -- what's the difference in revenue?\nDavid Solomon: Well, at a high level, that comment is -- looks over the past four years that we've grown our Asset Management business -- Asset & Wealth Management business, and it highlights in the alternative raising over that period, this initial period of investment, what the mix has been between wealth, the institutional client base or other channels like third-party wealth, retail, et cetera. When you look at our strategy, Dan, we -- if you go back 20 years, most of our fundraising for these activities came from our private wealth channel and the percentage of the money we managed was much higher than 40% from private wealth. So as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community, the sovereign wealth community areas where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding, that percentage of wealth funding will probably decrease, but I'm not going to speculate exactly where it will go. At scale, the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive. They're attractive in the private wealth channel and they're attractive in our institutional partnerships. But as I think you all know, they're not exactly identical. And people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate $10 billion definitely have a different economic proposition than somebody that's giving you $50 million or $100 million. And that's been consistent in the business for a long, long time. So we're continuing to scale the business. We have real margin targets in the business. I think we've got lots of opportunities and we're still in the early stages of using the platform of Goldman Sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the benefit of our scaled Asset & Wealth Management platform. And I'm confident we'll continue to make good progress.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. There's, obviously, all the uncertainty on the capital rules as was discussed earlier. But just in the near-term, how do you think about capital allocation? You're, obviously, continuing to lean into financing, which is capital-intensive, depending on how banking, and if banking comes back, that can consume capital. And then just touch on interest in bolt-on deals, and then obviously, anything on buybacks, which were pretty solid in '23. Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: I'll start, and Denis, might add some comments. We've always said that when there's activity to support our clients, that's our primary focus on where we can allocate capital. We've increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise -- our client franchises over the course of the last five years. And I think one of the reasons why our big broad Global Banking & Markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in different environments the way it's performed is we've been very, very focused on making sure we have the capital and the financial resources to serve our client base well. Where we see opportunities, we will continue to deploy capital there. That's in our broad capital planning program. We do generate a lot of capital from earnings. And to the degree that we don't see opportunities to deploy it with our clients, we will return it to shareholders. At the moment, we're taking a more conservative posture around that, just given some of the uncertainty around Basel III endgame. Although again, I think that's going to continue to evolve. And I also think we have a long track record of being very, very nimble with our ability to deploy. So we're going to continue to focus on making sure we've got the right resources to serve our clients. And as we generate capital, we have confidence in our capital position that we'll return capital to shareholders. And we've been very focused, as you've seen, on growing the dividend, and we plan to continue to do that.\nMatt O'Connor: And then just separately following up on the exit of legacy on-balance sheet principal investment, is there an expense reduction opportunity as those investments and some of the infrastructure goes away over time?\nDavid Solomon: There is an operating leverage story, which is one of the reasons why the margin in our Asset & Wealth Management business will continue to improve. When we were running an on-balance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of on-balance sheet position, the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions, creates a business that's scaled differently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone else's alternative platform. And so we're early in the journey. I'll just give a simple example. We went out last year, a year-and-a-half ago, and raised our first growth equity fund. We used to do that business on-balance sheet. We have lots and lots of positions, and therefore, a very, very broad team to service that. We raised our first fund. You need a smaller team to manage that fund. But when you go and you raise your second fund, you don't need to increase the scale of the team. And so there's real operating leverage in that, and that's part of our margin improvement story in Asset & Wealth Management over time. So the answer is, yes. I don't want to overstate this because it's not a massive part of the story, but it is a place where we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund form.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, David. Good morning, Dennis.\nDenis Coleman: Good morning\nDavid Solomon: Good morning, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning. In your prepared remarks, David, you were talking about, I think it was slide five or six, but about the success in growing the relationships with those top 100 FICC and equity clients, and you identified that the FICC and equity financing contributed to that success. And that's been a real hallmark for you guys over the last two or three years, the growth in that business. Can you dig down for us and share with us what has attributed to the success? Is it the capital you put into that business, the hiring of additional folks or people in the business, and as well as competition. Has the competition been more challenged than some of your competitors at all? Credit Suisse, of course, is no longer around. But if you could just give us a little more color on what's driving that success?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Gerard. At a high level, I'd point to a couple of things. But I'd start with the fact that that business is a scale business, and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of firm that really does operate those businesses at scale. And I think that's just important as a baseline. But I think there are a handful of things that we've done well. First, One GS and our One GS Ethos. If you go back historically, we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience. And clients would come into the firm in different places and get different experiences. And we spent a lot of time, and this goes back to 2019 really, thinking about how do these clients experience the firm? And we went out, we talked to them, we listened to their feedback. They really wanted to deal with the firm as a partner, one partner. I think we've made through One GS and that ethos, real progress in dealing with these very large clients in this business in an integrated approach that's improved their experience. And because it's improved their experience, they feel more partner-like with us, and therefore, that's improved our wallet share. Secondarily, we've become a much bigger financer of their activities. And when you finance their activities, you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem. And number three, we've also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view, a very long-term approach to transacting with them. They need our help sometimes with things that aren't that economically attractive. We want to be there. If you do that, you do that consistently, you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive. And so I think those three things combined with our scale platform have really helped us. When we look at our wallet shares, we continue to spend a lot of time. John and I spend a lot of time, and Denis, too, talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business, asking for their feedback. And as we take that feedback, we'll continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence. And as you saw from the presentation that we put up, one of the things that we're really focused on is how our One GS operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. It's a big, big tenet of what we're trying to do.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then I know you've talked about the pipelines and your comments about what we might be able to see in ECM and other areas this year. Can you also give us a little flavor on what parts of the -- since you're obviously a global force, what parts of the globe are you seeing the best potential? Is it the Americas, is it Europe, or is it Asia?\nDavid Solomon: Well, it's scale. The Americas is the biggest part of the activity level. And just given the resilience of the US economy, I think you've seen a material pick up there, proportionally that's broader than other places. But we are seeing more activity across Europe, particularly strategic dialogue. I'd say, the one place where things are slower, obviously, is in Asia with respect to China. And just given the nature of economic activity there, where things are positioned, that still seems slower, both on both the M&A side and the capital market side. But those are comments that make it a high-level, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Always appreciate the insights. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. So I wanted to ask a couple of questions about comp leverage and operating margins. And maybe just to start off, Denis, you noted the adjusted efficiency ratio set at 65% versus the reported figure in the mid-70s. When we try to adjust for various items, at least in the public disclosure, it looks like the core adjusted efficiency somewhere in the upper 60s. And I was hoping you can maybe just help us reconcile some of the different items to get down to that 65% figure and whether that's the appropriate jumping off point that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to '24?\nDenis Coleman: So, Steven, I'd say, I think the 65% is a good jumping off point for 2024. And as the business evolves from there, as I indicated on a prior question, we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the firm. Certain of our activities attract different degrees of transaction-based and other expenses as we prosecute those activities. And so we'll have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like. We'll have to be mindful, obviously, what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward in 2024. I think on the compensation side of the equation, you noticed our disclosure, that was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Our revenues net of PCL in the year were up 1%, and our compensation roughly flat. We observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of significant execution activity, and we want to make sure that we're in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into '24 with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see. In terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential, most of those are pretty discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the one-off FDIC special assessment. The one area we'll continue to manage carefully is on CIEs as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as we've discussed.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. And just for a follow-up relating to the comments you just made, Denis, on comp leverage, specifically. It looks like the expectation is for revenues to grow about $4 billion this year for The Street. The comp dollars are expected to increase only about $600 million. You do have a good track record of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins. But I just wanted to get a sense, given you were alluding to the fact that you're going to pay for talent and you're going to compensate people appropriately that execute well on the platform, how we should be thinking about incremental comp leverage, is an 85% comp margin a realistic expectation given where the revenue growth is ultimately going to come from?\nDenis Coleman: Steven, I'll make a comment. David wants to make another one as well. We're very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform. We're also focused on driving scale across the platform. And meanwhile, we're staying true to our mantra of pay-per-performance. It's what our people expect, and it's one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients. The ultimate compensation payout relative to the results in 2024 really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reflect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention, service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders.\nSteven Chubak: Great. That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I was just wondering what you're going to do about the Lead Independent Director, who I guess is no longer on your Board, Bayo, I guess, his firm got purchased and now you need to get a new lead director. Is that someone from the Board currently, someone from outside Goldman Sachs, what type of person is the Board looking for?\nDavid Solomon: So I appreciate the question, Mike. As you highlight, at the end of last week, Bayo sold his business to BlackRock. Bayo still is the Lead Director. That deal won't close until sometime in the third or fourth quarter. Bayo is the Lead Director. We have a governance process in place. Our Board has met and at the appropriate time, we'll make announcement as to the transition. But at this point, other than the fact that because of the sale, it will create a transition. I have nothing more to say other than Bayo is still the Lead Director, and we'll manage the transition in an orderly process and no surprises.\nMike Mayo: Okay. So what? You would consider people outside of Goldman Sachs currently for that or?\nDavid Solomon: Well, we're always adding people to our Board, Mike. But I'm not going to make comments. I'm not going to make forward comments about our governance process and our Board looks at this at the time that the Board takes action. We announced a clear transition. I'll be happy to answer questions and talk about it.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes The Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was a dynamic year. The US economy proved to be more resilient than expected, despite a number of headwinds to growth, including a significant tightening of financial conditions, regional bank failures, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, this was the year of execution for Goldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our strategic focus, we further strengthened our core businesses. As we enter 2024, the potential for rate cuts in the first half of this year has renewed optimism for a soft landing. We are already seeing signs of potential resurgence in strategic activity, which is reflected in our backlog. I am starting today's presentation with a strategic update, and Denis will provide comments on the financial results. Beginning on page one, we aspire to be the world's most exceptional financial institution, united by our shared value client service, partnership, integrity, and excellence. And over the last 155 years, we have created one of the most aspirational brands in financial services. Goldman Sachs is a preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management. We've continued to simplify our strategy, and today is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, as well as highlight avenues for further growth. Strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence and to further strengthen our client franchise. As we show on page two, we have two world-class and interconnected franchises that are well-positioned to achieve these strategic objectives. First, Global Banking & Markets, which includes our top rank investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and a leading capital markets business. It also includes our number one equities franchise and top three FICC franchise. We are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products. And second, our unified Asset & Wealth Management business where we are leading global active asset manager with a top five alternative business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise. This is a scaled business with over $2.8 trillion in assets under supervision and where we see significant opportunity for further growth. Across these two businesses, our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. On page three, we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent Investor Day in February 2023. Global Banking & Markets, we've maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking. In FICC and equities, we have improved our standing with the top 150 clients. We generated record total financing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years. In Asset & Wealth Management, we've driven solid investment performance and consistent growth in a more durable revenue base of management, other fees, and private banking and lending revenues. This past year, we reduced our historical principal investments by $13 billion, and also surpassed our five-year alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule. I will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment. Before I do, I would like to speak about how we've narrowed our strategic focus. We made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them. We exited the Marcus lending business and sold substantially all of our Marcus loan portfolio. We sold our Personal Financial Management business. We announced the sale of GreenSky, which remains on track to close this quarter. We also sold the majority of our GreenSky loan portfolio, which settled in the fourth quarter. We've also reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer. We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements and our consumer activities. I firmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth. But it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed. Our consumer ambitions have produced over $150 billion of deposits, which we expect to grow further from here. These deposits have materially improved the firm's funding profile. Now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win. We recognize that scale matters as it allows the firm to operate more efficiently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs, making unit economics more favorable. And we need to be measured and focused in our execution. Our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position, scale, and exceptional talent. On page four, in Global Banking & Markets, our leading and diversified franchise has produced average revenues of $32 billion over the last four years across a number of different market environments, demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate. In the last several years, we made a concerted effort to grow our wallet share and financing revenues, which have clearly raised the revenue floor for these businesses. We have also generated attractive returns with an average ROE fully allocated of over 16% over the last four years. Turning to page five, a key part of enhancing this durability has been executing on our strategic priorities. Our efforts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly 350 basis points since 2019. We've maintained our league table rankings of number one in announced and completed M&A, number one in equity and equity-related underwriting, number two in high yield debt. In FICC and equities, we're in the top three with 117 of our top 150 clients. These competitive positions are a reflection of our One Goldman Sachs approach and our clients' confidence in us. In addition, we have significantly increased more durable financing revenue. FICC and equity financing together have grown at a 15% CAGR since 2019 to a new record of nearly $8 billion. Turning to Asset & Wealth Management on page six. We've continued to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019. We've also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pre-tax margin target on an adjusted basis. Turning to page seven. Our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inflows. Over 75% of our traditional funds performed in the top half of Morningstar funds, while on alternatives, over 90% of our funds were in the top half of Cambridge funds, both over the last five years. The fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows across our platform. I want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over $250 billion in alternatives since 2019, surpassing our $225 billion target a year early. This fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation and developing new strategy, as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and longstanding track records. Fundraising has been broad-based across geographies and asset classes with approximately 40% coming from our ultra-high net worth relationships. I'm very proud of this achievement. When we were preparing for our first Investor Day four years ago, I remember how big a reach our initial target of $150 billion seemed. We've surpassed not only that target, but also our increased target of $225 billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business. Putting all this together on page eight, you can see how much we've improved the durability of revenues across the firm. On this slide, baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represents the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical, namely advisory, underwriting, and intermediation. We believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In fact, in all of the years since we became a public company, it has never happened. In dark blue, you can see the more durable revenues from financing, management, and other fees, as well as private banking and lending, which in aggregate have grown at 13% CAGR since 2019. Taken together, these two components make up over 70% of revenues in 2023. On top of that, we consistently generate upside across different market environments because of our diversified franchise. The increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams, coupled with the diversification of our scaled franchise and our ability to capture upside, demonstrate the revenue-generating power of our firm. Narrowing our strategic focus, our leadership team spent a significant amount of time in 2023 realigning the firm's priorities with our strategic vision, our values, and our strengths, which we highlighted on page nine. You've heard us talk about many of these elements before, starting with our strategic objectives. First, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence. Second, to run world-class, differentiated, and durable businesses. Third, to invest and operate at scale. As you can see on the page, our execution focus areas for 2024 are aligned with these strategic objectives. Taking one example, investing in our people and culture. Exceptional quality of our people, supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problem, and it's imperative that we continue to invest in them. All in these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes, to continue to be a trusted advisor to our clients, to be an employer of choice for our people, and to generate mid-teens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return. With everything we achieved in 2023, coupled with our clear and simplified strategy, we have a much stronger platform for 2024. I feel very confident about the future of Goldman Sachs, our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence, and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results. Sure. Sure, Glenn. I mean, just at a base level, I'm pretty optimistic, given the way we've got the firm positioned. And there's no question that these capital markets and M&A activity levels have been depressed. As I've said before, I don't think that continues year-on-year-on year, and we really started to see, in the second half of this year, real improvement. As Denis highlighted, the M&A backlog saw a really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter. And I'd just highlight, and I know this is obvious, but I think it's worth stating, we put up $1 billion of M&A revenue. If the backlog is growing, that means we've got to replace the $1 billion that we put up, plus then have growth. And so, that's a very, very strong replenishment. And I would just say the level of strategic dialogue has definitely increased and we're seeing it across our platform. I'm encouraged by capital markets activity. I'm not going to say, it's running back to 10-year averages right away, but it has materially improved. I do think you're going to see some more meaningful IPOs in 2024. And we are just, across debt and equity issuance, seeing more activity, more engagement. At the end of the day, people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time, but they've got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market, and we're seeing that come through. So when I look broadly, it feels better. There's a lot going on in the world. And so I think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry 98% of the time about the 2% of things that can go wrong. So we're going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the firm, but I do think the firm is incredibly well-levered to this pickup, and it feels better is the way I'd frame it. Yeah, first of all, I think we made a lot of progress last year. And so if you look at what we accomplished, I think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful, especially given the environment. One of the things that happened is we pulled some stuff forward that we didn't expect to monetize in 2023 -- into 2023. And so to be clear, our focus is to get that to zero as quickly as possible. If you're operating inside this firm and you're operating in that business, you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible. But we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately. We set a clear target over the next three years to get to zero. My guess is, we've got a good shot if we executed doing that quicker than that. Yeah. Good morning. Sure. I mean, at a high level, what I would say, this quarter, intermediation activity was quiet, and particularly in the back half of the quarter, kind of late November and December, clients were quiet. If you look at the whole year, I don't think it's fair, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't think it's fair to say the whole year is back to '19 levels. The overall activity levels were up and down during the year. We have a big diversified business. When our clients are active, we execute on it, we continue to grow the financing revenues, which make it overall more durable. But it was a quiet quarter, particularly the back half, in terms of intermediation. I don't expect it to continue at that pace. I think Denis' comments in the opening, we're seeing more activity in the first few weeks of the year. But we'll watch it. And as you know, that activity, particularly in that segment, can move up and down based on what's going on in the macro environment. Denis said in his comments, we've got no other updates on the credit card partnerships other than what he stated. We continue to work with Apple on a partnership with them to serve our customers and to continue to reduce the drag from the partnership, and we continue to make good progress. And the drag in 2024 will be materially less. Sure. So I appreciate the question, Mike, and obviously, we're very focused on it. It wasn't an A environment for our core business. In fact, I don't even think it was a B environment. When investment banking is operating at low levels, that is an impact overall. I do think that it's important to look at our core business of banking and markets, which is a very significant portion of the firm and do note, on a fully allocated basis in this environment, which was not a B-plus or an A environment, given the investment banking activity, it had a 12% ROE. We continue to believe through the cycle that that business is a mid-teens business. And so I don't think we're going to see -- stay at the level of activities that we've been at. We have that business positioned very well. And so you'll get some upside returns there in a better environment. And then secondarily, on Asset & Wealth Management, we continue to reduce the balance sheet. The balance sheet has been a drag on returns, but I think we've been pretty clear that we can drive the Asset & Wealth Management with a smaller balance sheet to mid-teens returns or better with a 25% margin. We're on that journey. We're making progress. I think we'll make very good progress over the next two years. And if you look at those two businesses, that's the vast, vast majority of the firm, and I think they can operate mid-teens. We've significantly reduced the other drags. We got a lot of it behind us in this year. That doesn't mean there won't be anything, but the drag from platforms in 2024 will be materially reduced from what it's been. And so I think we're making good progress in the medium-term is over the next couple of years, provided it's -- provided that it's a reasonable environment. And so I think you'll see good progress on the overall positioning of the firm over the next three to five years. They absolutely do. I mean, when markets improve, they help the disposition. There's no question. I also -- when you look at the last two years, we've had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that, but on a much smaller balance sheet in 2024. With a better market, you actually might have some benefit to revenue performance, but we're focused on reducing that broadly. You see you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on GreenSky, move GM to held for sale. And so you have more transparency on that. We think the drag will be significantly reduced in 2024. When we're comfortable providing more specific color on that, we will provide it. But small in the overall context of the firm and the firm's performance. Thank you. Well, at a high level, that comment is -- looks over the past four years that we've grown our Asset Management business -- Asset & Wealth Management business, and it highlights in the alternative raising over that period, this initial period of investment, what the mix has been between wealth, the institutional client base or other channels like third-party wealth, retail, et cetera. When you look at our strategy, Dan, we -- if you go back 20 years, most of our fundraising for these activities came from our private wealth channel and the percentage of the money we managed was much higher than 40% from private wealth. So as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community, the sovereign wealth community areas where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding, that percentage of wealth funding will probably decrease, but I'm not going to speculate exactly where it will go. At scale, the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive. They're attractive in the private wealth channel and they're attractive in our institutional partnerships. But as I think you all know, they're not exactly identical. And people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate $10 billion definitely have a different economic proposition than somebody that's giving you $50 million or $100 million. And that's been consistent in the business for a long, long time. So we're continuing to scale the business. We have real margin targets in the business. I think we've got lots of opportunities and we're still in the early stages of using the platform of Goldman Sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the benefit of our scaled Asset & Wealth Management platform. And I'm confident we'll continue to make good progress. I'll start, and Denis, might add some comments. We've always said that when there's activity to support our clients, that's our primary focus on where we can allocate capital. We've increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise -- our client franchises over the course of the last five years. And I think one of the reasons why our big broad Global Banking & Markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in different environments the way it's performed is we've been very, very focused on making sure we have the capital and the financial resources to serve our client base well. Where we see opportunities, we will continue to deploy capital there. That's in our broad capital planning program. We do generate a lot of capital from earnings. And to the degree that we don't see opportunities to deploy it with our clients, we will return it to shareholders. At the moment, we're taking a more conservative posture around that, just given some of the uncertainty around Basel III endgame. Although again, I think that's going to continue to evolve. And I also think we have a long track record of being very, very nimble with our ability to deploy. So we're going to continue to focus on making sure we've got the right resources to serve our clients. And as we generate capital, we have confidence in our capital position that we'll return capital to shareholders. And we've been very focused, as you've seen, on growing the dividend, and we plan to continue to do that. There is an operating leverage story, which is one of the reasons why the margin in our Asset & Wealth Management business will continue to improve. When we were running an on-balance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of on-balance sheet position, the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions, creates a business that's scaled differently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone else's alternative platform. And so we're early in the journey. I'll just give a simple example. We went out last year, a year-and-a-half ago, and raised our first growth equity fund. We used to do that business on-balance sheet. We have lots and lots of positions, and therefore, a very, very broad team to service that. We raised our first fund. You need a smaller team to manage that fund. But when you go and you raise your second fund, you don't need to increase the scale of the team. And so there's real operating leverage in that, and that's part of our margin improvement story in Asset & Wealth Management over time. So the answer is, yes. I don't want to overstate this because it's not a massive part of the story, but it is a place where we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund form. Good morning, Gerard. Sure, Gerard. At a high level, I'd point to a couple of things. But I'd start with the fact that that business is a scale business, and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of firm that really does operate those businesses at scale. And I think that's just important as a baseline. But I think there are a handful of things that we've done well. First, One GS and our One GS Ethos. If you go back historically, we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience. And clients would come into the firm in different places and get different experiences. And we spent a lot of time, and this goes back to 2019 really, thinking about how do these clients experience the firm? And we went out, we talked to them, we listened to their feedback. They really wanted to deal with the firm as a partner, one partner. I think we've made through One GS and that ethos, real progress in dealing with these very large clients in this business in an integrated approach that's improved their experience. And because it's improved their experience, they feel more partner-like with us, and therefore, that's improved our wallet share. Secondarily, we've become a much bigger financer of their activities. And when you finance their activities, you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem. And number three, we've also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view, a very long-term approach to transacting with them. They need our help sometimes with things that aren't that economically attractive. We want to be there. If you do that, you do that consistently, you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive. And so I think those three things combined with our scale platform have really helped us. When we look at our wallet shares, we continue to spend a lot of time. John and I spend a lot of time, and Denis, too, talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business, asking for their feedback. And as we take that feedback, we'll continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence. And as you saw from the presentation that we put up, one of the things that we're really focused on is how our One GS operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. It's a big, big tenet of what we're trying to do. Well, it's scale. The Americas is the biggest part of the activity level. And just given the resilience of the US economy, I think you've seen a material pick up there, proportionally that's broader than other places. But we are seeing more activity across Europe, particularly strategic dialogue. I'd say, the one place where things are slower, obviously, is in Asia with respect to China. And just given the nature of economic activity there, where things are positioned, that still seems slower, both on both the M&A side and the capital market side. But those are comments that make it a high-level, Gerard. So I appreciate the question, Mike. As you highlight, at the end of last week, Bayo sold his business to BlackRock. Bayo still is the Lead Director. That deal won't close until sometime in the third or fourth quarter. Bayo is the Lead Director. We have a governance process in place. Our Board has met and at the appropriate time, we'll make announcement as to the transition. But at this point, other than the fact that because of the sale, it will create a transition. I have nothing more to say other than Bayo is still the Lead Director, and we'll manage the transition in an orderly process and no surprises. Well, we're always adding people to our Board, Mike. But I'm not going to make comments. I'm not going to make forward comments about our governance process and our Board looks at this at the time that the Board takes action. We announced a clear transition. I'll be happy to answer questions and talk about it."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let me start on page 10 of the presentation. In 2023, we generated net revenues of $46.3 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, and earnings per share of $22.87. As David highlighted, we made significant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions, as well as the impact of the FDIC special assessment fees on the slide. In aggregate, these items reduced full year net earnings by $2.8 billion, earnings per share by $8.04, and our ROE by 2.6 percentage points. Turning to performance by business, starting on page 12. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $30 billion for the year, down 8% as higher equities revenues were more than offset by a decline in FICC revenues and investment banking fees versus last year. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees of $1.7 billion fell 12% year-over-year, driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in 2022. For 2023, we maintained our number one league table position in announced and completed M&A as well as in equity and equity-related underwriting and ranked second in high yield debt underwriting. Our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, driven by a significant increase in advisory. As David mentioned, we are encouraged by the robust level of dialogues with our corporate client base. And though we're only two weeks into the New Year, there have been solid levels of capital markets activity in both the US and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2 billion in the quarter, down 24% from strong performance last year, amid lower activity in rates and other macro products. In FICC financing, revenues rose to a record $739 million. Equities net revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter, up 26% year-on-year. The year-over-year increase in intermediation revenues was driven by better results in derivatives. Financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose year-over-year with continued strength on higher average balances. Across FICC and equities, financing revenues rose 10% in 2023, consistent with our priority to grow client financing. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 14. For 2023, revenues of $13.9 billion rose 4% year-over-year, as an increase in more durable revenues, including record management and other fees and record private banking and lending revenues, offset a decline in equity investments revenues and incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.4 billion were up 9% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $9.5 billion, putting us on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024, notwithstanding the sale of our PFM business. Equity investments produced net revenues of $838 million, higher year-over-year, driven by modest gains in our public portfolio versus losses in the fourth quarter of last year. Results in this line item also included a gain of $349 million from the sale of PFM. Moving on to page 15. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and alternative assets, and representing our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. Turning to page 16 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $295 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $571 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, surpassing our $2 billion target for 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $32 billion for the quarter and $72 billion for the year. As David mentioned, third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day now stands at over $250 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $46 billion, of which roughly $16 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $4 billion, including sales of $3 billion of CIEs across over 40 positions, bringing reductions for the year to $13 billion. We continue to focus on exiting this portfolio over the medium-term, though we don't expect portfolio reductions in 2024 to be at the same pace as in 2023. I'll now turn to platform solutions on page 17. Full year revenues were $2.4 billion, up 58% versus 2022. Quarterly net revenues of $577 million were up 12% year-over-year on higher consumer platform results amid growth in average credit card balances. As David mentioned, we reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer, the impact of which was to move the loans to held for sale and release the associated loan loss reserves of approximately $160 million. We have no additional updates regarding our credit card partnerships at this time. On page 18, firm-wide net interest income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter was down 13% relative to the third quarter, reflecting an increase in funding costs supporting trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $183 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting an increase in other collateralized lending, which includes the pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities we won at auction in October. Our provision for credit losses was $577 million. In relation to our consumer portfolio, provisions were driven by net charge-offs and seasonal balance growth, partially offset by the GM reserve release I mentioned. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments that were generally in line with the last two quarters, with roughly half related to CRE. Let's turn to expenses on page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $34.5 billion, excluding severance-related costs of $310 million, compensation expense was flat year-over-year, amid solid core performance, and as the market for talent remains competitive. As of the fourth quarter, we achieved our goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies, which allowed us to continue investing in our talent. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion, and included CIE impairments of $262 million. The year-over-year increase in non-comp expenses was driven by the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million. Our effective tax rate for 2023 was 20.7%. For 2024, we expect a tax rate of 22% to 23%. Turning to capital on slide 21. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.5% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, 150 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion at an average price of $311 and common stock dividends of $922 million. While we expect to remain nimble with respect to capital return, given the ongoing uncertainty around the Basel III proposed rule, our capital management philosophy is unchanged. We prioritize supporting client deployment opportunities, sustainably growing our dividend, and returning excess to shareholders in the form of buybacks, particularly when valuation levels are attractive. In conclusion, we made solid progress on narrowing our strategic focus in 2023 with our execution driving a much stronger platform for 2024. Our best-in-class core businesses are well-positioned to execute on our strategic objectives. We will continue to Harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence, run world-class differentiated and durable businesses, and invest to operate our businesses at scale. Additionally, the execution focus areas we've identified for 2024 will help us drive the outcomes of delivering for clients, our people, and our shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. So, thanks, Ebrahim. So we've been clear over the last several years that we see opportunities to grow both FICC and equity financing. And it's a virtuous activity for us. It dovetails well with our focus on clients and our focus on market share. We have a lot of expertise in this space and we see a lot of demand from clients for us to deploy both into FICC and equities. We now have leading equities franchise overall. Our equities financing business is in a leadership position and at scale. It has grown significantly and we continue to see opportunities to increase the activities that we do with our existing clients and bring new clients on the platform. So we look out into 2024 and 2025. We continue to be very focused. I think there's good opportunities across both FICC and equity financing in GBM. Sure, Brennan, and thank you for that question. Our Marcus, deposit platform, has been a real strategic advantage to us in terms of overall firm-wide funding. We did set out a strategy to set our pricing at the higher-end of the pricing envelope to maintain, sustain, and grow our balances across that platform. We haven't adjusted our strategy at this point. We saw good growth across our various strategic deposit funding channels last year, not just Marcus. Overall, deposits are up over $40 billion on the year. And I would just say, as we move into 2024, we continue to focus on driving growth across the strategic channels and be thoughtful about our overall funding mix. Yeah. Yeah, so at a high level, Devin, appreciate the question. I think we can continue to grow our financing activity given the scale and the size of the market, the way market activity is growing, and we will normalize investment banking activity. And obviously, over time, given our position, and if you assume growth in the world, growth in market capital world, we will continue, as we have for the last 25, 35 years, grow our investment banking activity. When there's real disruption in the world, we find that FICC can be a little bit countercyclical in some way, shape or form. But that's not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation or market activity. I think there's a lot going on in the world. The trajectory of rates, there's a point of view on rates and inflation, but it's certainly not certain to me. I think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment. There's debates about how the Fed continues on its quantitative tightening or doesn't continue on its quantitative tightening. And so all of this, I think, will continue to play into people being active in markets. So I do think just at a high level, look, this is a high level. I think the environment in 2024 feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in 2023. But I'm not a good predictor, and we're prepared to operate whatever environment we have to operate in. Sure, Devin. Thank you. And as you know, we have new disclosure the last couple of quarters on CRE in particular on the nature of the loans in that sector. And then as well as the on-balance sheet, both CRE and office in particular. You can obviously see from those disclosures, we've made substantial progress moving down the positions over the course of 2023, gave disclosure on the number of CIE positions that we moved down recently, and we've made really significant progress. We disclosed on prior calls and our office exposures from an impairment and marks perspective, we're sitting at roughly 50%. So we think that based on the visibility that we had and the activity that we had over the course of 2023 that that portfolio, and the broader portfolio for that matter, sits at the right place. As we move into 2024, there should be opportunities for further dispositions and we'll remain very focused on what the mix of that disposition activity is. When David was reviewing our expectations with respect to HPI sell-down on the forward, in addition to moving towards our medium-term target, we're also mindful of what the long-term franchise impact of those sell-down activities are. So just to give you a sense for why we may have cautioned on pace, we have some meaningful credit exposures where we enjoy a position of incumbency. And for the long-term benefit of the franchise, we very much hope that we'll remain as a lender and a supporter of those clients to exit those positions in advance of a potential refinancing would be to surrender our incumbency position. And so we're being thoughtful so that we can continue to reduce our risk while continuing to grow the third-party fund management business while supporting clients in the process. Sure. Appreciate the question. It's, obviously, something, Ryan, we're very, very focused on. We feel good about the fundraising progress we've made. I think when you look forward in 2024, you could expect us to raise another $40 billion to $50 billion of alternatives. We're, obviously, very focused on private credit. We do operate at scale on private credit. We have over $110 billion of private credit. But I think the opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale on private credit, especially given the way our franchise is positioned and the origination connection we have with our broad banking business gives us a unique platform and a unique competitive advantage. So we're going to continue to keep this focus. It doesn't stop because we met our goal. Our goal was meant to flame the opportunity set three-and-a-half years ago, but you'll see us continue to raise money on a year-to-year basis. And we've got some big funds that we're going to be in the market with in 2024, and we'll continue to build the partnerships with that client base. And both myself, John Waldron, and the broad team across our Asset Management division are spending a lot of time with the big capital allocators all over the world and continuing to invest in those relationships. Sure. Well, obviously, today marks the end of the comment period, and what I would say, it's certainly not the end of the process. In fact, I would say, it's the end of the beginning of the process. And so we're moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders, given our significant concern with the proposed rules. You'll see comment letters from us, from our peers. You'll also see many letters from end users, including pension funds, insurance companies, corporates who are particularly concerned about how this rule could affect their access to capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risks in their business. And I think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry, and also I think disadvantages the US from a competitive perspective. So to be clear, my view is the rule was not proposed appropriately and it should be withdrawn and reproposed. I don't think speculating on the impact of the rule as proposed, I think there's a pretty significant view out there that the Fed is listening carefully, they're taking in the feedback, and I don't think there's anyone that's looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed. We're very flexible with our capital, as I've said before. If the rules put certain changes in place, we'll also adjust businesses or pricing in businesses and certain activity to adapt. I think to speculate as to how we'll talk about this once it's in place before we have any idea what the rule is going to look like is premature. But we've got a lot of capital flexibility and we've proven over time we can be particularly nimble. And so we'll continue to focus. Thanks, Dan. So the efficiency ratio is something we are laser focused on. We continue to orient the firm to drive towards our 60% target. You mentioned the impact of selected items. If you take the impact over the course of 2023, the efficiency ratio would have been more like 65%. That's, obviously, not where we want it to be, but significantly better than the fully reported number. We have a number of initiatives across the firm to get after our non-compensation expense. We had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efficiency targets at the end of last year, rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year. There is a -- we have a ton of different categories. We're in the process of reviewing each and every category of our non-compensation expense, benchmarking it, reviewing KPIs, thinking about our processes, incentive structures, governance, things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efficiently as possible. We do see an impact of inflation across these activities, and it's for that reason, that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible. I think as we look into 2024, if you take a look at the disclosure round selected items, we don't expect those types of activities to repeat, and we'll be very, very -- remain very, very focused on maintaining our overall non-comp expense spend. And the other component of the efficiency ratio is, obviously, compensation expense. You saw that over the course of this year, we maintained our pay for performance orientation with respect to how we size that, and you should expect the same on the forward into 2024, that is obviously a performance-based and variable component of our overall expense. There are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable. Our largest items, both compensation as well as transaction expenses, are variable. So we will have to see how the types of activities unfold into 2024 and what the mix of our activities are to, ultimately, determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efficiency ratio. Good morning So, Steven, I'd say, I think the 65% is a good jumping off point for 2024. And as the business evolves from there, as I indicated on a prior question, we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the firm. Certain of our activities attract different degrees of transaction-based and other expenses as we prosecute those activities. And so we'll have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like. We'll have to be mindful, obviously, what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward in 2024. I think on the compensation side of the equation, you noticed our disclosure, that was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Our revenues net of PCL in the year were up 1%, and our compensation roughly flat. We observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of significant execution activity, and we want to make sure that we're in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into '24 with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see. In terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential, most of those are pretty discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the one-off FDIC special assessment. The one area we'll continue to manage carefully is on CIEs as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as we've discussed. Steven, I'll make a comment. David wants to make another one as well. We're very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform. We're also focused on driving scale across the platform. And meanwhile, we're staying true to our mantra of pay-per-performance. It's what our people expect, and it's one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients. The ultimate compensation payout relative to the results in 2024 really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reflect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention, service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Taryn and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. This call is being recorded today, October 17th, 2023. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd just like to take a moment to address the horrific events in the Middle East. We condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel on the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss of so many innocent lives. This is clearly an extremely difficult and uncertain time for the region, and it's very concerning for many of us around the world. We obviously will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds. Earlier this month, I marked the end of my fifth year as the CEO of Goldman Sachs. I've never felt more optimistic about the firm, and our strategy has never been more clear. We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking & Markets franchise, and our growing Asset & Wealth Management platform, both of which are being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle. As I reflect on the past five years, much of what has always made Goldman Sachs extraordinary remains the same, long track record of being a trusted adviser to the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals. A global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions, an aspirational brand, exceptional people and a culture of collaboration and excellence. Additionally, over this time, we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. This approach, coupled with our best-in-class talent, advice and execution capabilities has strengthened and solidified our leadership position across our businesses. As we sit here today, our client franchise is as strong as ever, enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions for our clients. For example, the IPO market has started to reopen. Since Labor Day, there have been four marquee IPOs priced in the United States, Arm Holdings, Instacart, Klaviyo and Birkenstock. Goldman Sachs was lead left on three of those four and the joint lead book runner on the fourth. No other bank can make that claim. Being entrusted to help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market requires long-standing client relationships, deep market expertise and experience. Given the execution of these transactions, I'm encouraged by the prospects of a wider reopening of capital markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect the continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic activity. As a leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity would be a tail [indiscernible] of Goldman Sachs. In Asset & Wealth Management, our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes we've seen across our franchise. While some active asset managers have faced quarterly outflows over the last few years, we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We generated record management and other fees of $2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target to 2024. We are also ahead of pace on our $2 billion target for alternative management fees. While market-leading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength, we know we still have work ahead of us. Earlier this year at Investor Day, we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus, and we have made significant progress on these priorities. Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we're doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we've seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned. Before I turn it over to Denis, I'd like to spend a moment on Basel III Endgame proposal and reiterate my views on it. We, of course, support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound financial system. There are some who have recently said we need to address the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, which is driving the needs of much higher regulations. But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital over the last 15 years, have improved the quality of capital, increased liquidity, simplified businesses that have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests. Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences. I believe if these rules are implemented, three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all sizes from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector. Policies that incentivize a transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could, in fact, increase systemic risk. And third, US competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world. They're the engine of our economy as access to capital allows for innovation and growth across the country. Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal. The net result of these proposed rules would be slower economic growth in the US, material improvement in the -- soundness of the banking system. We, alongside clients and others in the industry, have been engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders, and given this engagement, we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately, changes to the proposed rules. Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain top of mind, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business, and we remain firmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover financial results for the quarter.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.8 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in a [indiscernible] and a return on equity of 7.1%. As David highlighted, earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus, and we made strong progress across a number of activities. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE by 3.1 percentage points. These items include results related to our historical principal investments within Asset & Wealth Management, including the net impact of marks, sell-downs and CIE impairments as well as results relating to GreenSky, which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally, we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page four. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million, though industry volumes remained well below medium and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to-date, we ranked Number One in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and ranked number two in high-yield debt. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated, and our best-in-class franchise remains well positioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets. FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from a strong performance last year, particularly in currency and commodities and up relative to the second quarter. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $730 million grow sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally, we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, totaling just over $15 billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September. As we spoke about at our Investor Day, alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us, and the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, who we can serve even more holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives, while equities financing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower versus a record in quarter. Total financing revenues across FICC and Equities were nearly $6 billion for the year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our financing results, combined with the substantial share gains we've made since our first Investor Day are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. We are raising the floor in Global Banking & Markets as reflected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across Investment Banking. Now moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page five. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year, as higher deposit balances and spreads were offset by our sale of substantially all of the market loan portfolio. We remain very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period. Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results for Marcus loans negatively impacted our 6% pre-tax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. We saw $11 billion of liquidity inflows and $7 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $542 million of management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of Goldman Sachs Vintage Fund IX in the third quarter, our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. We are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions, page eight. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by a $637 million associated reserve release as we moved the portfolio to held for sale. On page nine firm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, down sequentially as increased funding cost supported trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, flat with the prior quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio, offset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments were partially offset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter. On page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter. CRE loans continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions, with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have marked or impaired office-related exposures by approximately 50% this year. Now turning to expenses on page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be achieved in 2023 and 2024 and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efficiencies allow us to reinvest in our highest performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains fiercely competitive. Quarterly non-compensation expense were $0.9 billion. The year-over-year increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in the intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE impairments of $358 million. While onetime expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to focus on bringing down noncomp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efficiency goal. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, high versus the first half due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of under 23%. Now onto slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield. In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks so much. I guess just big picture, if we add back all the significant items in the quarter, we're obviously still well short of the mid-teens targets. I know this is super slow times, like decade lows in investment banking, and you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuff. So I wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because in the back of our mind, we also have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator. So I wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much is -- comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity? How much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator? I know it's tough but I want to say high level [indiscernible] pieces and thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Glenn, and appreciate the question. And so we'll keep it high level and let's separate into what we've got and then we can have a separate discussion about Basel III. But first, we are simplifying the firm and kind of managing the firm to drive us toward the overwhelming majority of the firm to be in two core businesses, our Global Banking & Markets franchise, which is performing very well in an environment that's not a great environment for that business. Investment Banking activities are well below 10-year norms. I don't think that will stay that way. But if you look at the performance of the business through nine months, that business, which is kind of 7% of the firm, that is two-thirds to 70% of the firm, that business is operating with a 13.4% ROE and an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business. I can't tell you when the environment will get better, but I do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years. History tells us that it doesn't stay short -- it doesn't stay closed for multiple years at a time. There is an adjustment. We're making the adjustment. Yes, the world's uncertain. As we mentioned, that could be a headwind. But I do think it will improve. And that business performs well. And we firmly believe that, that business is a mid-teens through the cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet shares, the way we've grown our financing footprint, which adds more balance to the business and with our market-leading franchises across that business. Second, we have the Asset & Wealth Management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal and make it a lower capital business. We're on that journey. I think you see us making progress. We've talked about how we've reduced the historical principal businesses -- the historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We set a target for $15 billion by next year, which we'll meet and then close to zero two years later. And so that business, we have a high degree of confidence we'll operate at mid-teens or higher as we reposition it. As we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. We're narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag. And we're relatively confident that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in that. So you add that up with what we have and I think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target. Now, the Basel rules. The Basel rules, if they were implemented as they're position now would be a headwind to that but also that doesn't account for how we optimize and how we pass through pricing. We've seen things before. I'm not to saying it won't be a headwind, but I don't want to speculate on what it would do to our targets until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it. So we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders. And when there's more clarity on Basel, we're committed to giving you a clear picture of that view. But I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. I'm not saying you are. I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point.\nGlenn Schorr: Okay. I appreciate that. One quickie follow-up on your prepared remarks. You mentioned a number of sectors that have yet to absorb the higher rates. I'm curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how meaningful that is. I'm thinking from more of the big picture economy standpoint, but that caught my ear. Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Glenn, as I listened to you play it back, what I'd say, US economy has been more resilient. The fiscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. I'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy, we will see more sluggishness. Now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly, there's a good debate on where this all lands. But we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. And I just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy, not all, but most sectors of the economy. And I do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. I am hearing as I interact with CEOs, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. I don't want to over-amplify that because I think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. But I think that gear from watching closely.\nGlenn Schorr: Thanks so much.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess maybe just one first follow-up, Denis. I just want to make sure I heard you correct. Did you say you marked your CRE exposure by 50% in CRE office? And on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond office CRE. Clearly, it's a very manageable issue for you, but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. How much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, yes, to clarify, for our CRE and CIE exposure in the office space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year. So that's -- I think that's quite significant. We started the year with about $15 billion of CRE alternative investments. That's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. So we're making very, very significant progress against those exposures. If you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-office, the adjustment there through marks, our impairment is about 15% year-to-date. So we feel we've reduced a lot of notional appropriately reflected the valuations in those positions. But as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess just a separate question. I mean, I think the capital markets environment, it is what it is. When you look at the firm over the next year or two, if maybe, David, where do you see the best growth opportunities? One, maybe talk about the client franchise and cap markets financing. Is that getting better or worse? And then there's a lot of talk about private credit, direct lending. You've talked about credit being an opportunity. Just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or two?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So in our Global Banking & Markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on our execution to continue to grow our wallet share. We expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts, and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one, two or three as opposed to just top three. And so we still do see some wallet share opportunities but we obviously have a very strong wallet share. So that's not most significant. We are growing our financing for our Global Banking & Markets franchise, and we expect to continue to grow that financing footprint, and we have a plan to continue to put more financial resources toward growing that financing footprint. And we do think that it has reasonable returns. And it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a significant financer with them. When you turn to Asset & Wealth Management, I think we've been very clear at our Investor Day, and Mark stated this, that we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high single-digits. That is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and the continued growth in the wealth management sector, where we are experiencing good growth, and we still see good opportunities in Wealth Management to grow the franchise all over the world. And we've made continued progress on that journey. When you talk about private credit, we have, as you know, over $100 billion of private credit. We've launched private credit vehicles. We obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at Global Banking & Markets. And what we do with financing, which we think can also be an Asset & Wealth Management opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect significant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise. So those are a handful of things I'd highlight at this point.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning. Just another one on Basel III Endgame. I appreciate that you think it's going to change and all that. But now that you've had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is, any more color on how you think it affects the competitiveness of your markets businesses? Are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted? And then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions.\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Christian. I appreciate it. I mean, I'm going to talk very high level because, again, this is all fluid. But obviously, if these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an effect of the businesses. But it's different from business to business. There are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end users, whether they're corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you'd pass on cost. A corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative. I can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher. Obviously, it's some balance, they would think about that differently. There are certain businesses where we might reduce our activity level because with the new Basel rules, the terms don't look attractive. But there are others, and one I'd point to that's most obvious, which by the way, a significant part of the impact to us would be is prime, okay? There aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business. There are very few in Europe, a little bit, and obviously, the Europeans, if this was implemented this way, would have an advantage. But at the end of the day, there are a handful of scale players. There are lots of scale institutions that need that service. Our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way. We'd have to look at the final rules. We'd have to adjust. So it will affect behavior. It will affect pricing. It will affect optimization. But I know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer, I think you need to see the rules, and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality, whatever it is. And it's not binary that it only affects us or others in the industry that are obviously be a process of working through that, as we have in the past.\nChristian Bolu: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. Maybe a question on the platform businesses here. I just have a two-part question. I guess firstly, maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the partnership with Apple. Can the economics work for Goldman in the current states or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that partnership? And then the second question is more on the credit quality in your senior credit cards. Kind of what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio? How does it compare to your expectations and the broader sort of credit card industry?\nDavid Solomon: All right. I'll start on the first part, Denis will make some comments on credit and the portfolio. First, I think we hired a gentleman, Bill Johnson, who's got decades of experience to help us better run and better optimize the credit card portfolio, the credit card partnerships. As we've stated to you a number of times, and I'll repeat it here very clearly, we've worked to narrow our focus. You've seen us execute around Marcus loans and GreenSky. Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships. So our focus at the moment is on managing them better, getting rid of the drag and bringing them to profitability. And we're making progress, both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. And Bill Johnson joining is helping with all that. We'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine what's best in the long run for Goldman Sachs. But our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next 12 to 24 months and ensuring we operate them better. Denis, do you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. What I'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. A couple of things to bear in mind. In Consumer, the net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter and the total dollar amount of charge-offs down as well. You'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio. That adjustment is basically a function of GreenSky being removed from that ratio. And so now that applies to the cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now. On the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. We made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment.\nChristian Bolu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. So David you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses. I was hoping you could just speak to the commitment to deliver on the 60% efficiency goal? And maybe more specifically, given changes in revenue mix, some recently announced business exits and the heightened competition you cited, how that's going to impact your ability to deliver on that 60%, if at all?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So we continue to be committed to the 60% efficiency ratio. But as you know, we're moving through, we're narrowing our focus. We're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on, Steven, and highlight for you. I'm going to turn to Denis to make sure that we get the number right. But ex those one-off items, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been?\nDenis Coleman: About 64.6%.\nDavid Solomon: Okay. So putting it in perspective, I think it's important to highlight that we don't think the things that we're highlighting continue in perpetuity. We're trying to narrow the focus and when we look at our Global Banking & Markets business and our Asset & Wealth Management platform, we think we have the right target. Now back to your point, Steve, about competition. The competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains very, very strong. And so we think we've got a very, very good talent ecosystem. I feel good about the hiring we're doing. I'd just highlight that for our analyst jobs out of university, we had 260,000 applications for approximately 2,600 jobs. There are over 1 million applications for employment at Goldman Sachs last year. Very, very aspirational and desirous place to work, but the competition for talent remains high. And so we'll strike the right balance and making an investment in our talent. You heard Denis talk about some of our efficiencies and the fact that the efficiencies allow us to make a reinvestment in some of our best talent. We feel good about where we are, but we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy, which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, that the efficiency ratio target that we're hiring -- that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target.\nSteven Chubak: That's great color. And just for my follow-up, a broader question on the sponsor outlook. Alts fundraising, it's continued at a healthy clip, but PE is facing numerous headwinds, whether it's the LP denominator effect, higher rates and just slower realization activity in general. I was hoping you could speak to the broader outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor booking activity as well as the alternative asset management business.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So that broadly defined sponsor community, Steven, which really is the broad alternatives world, private capital world, the first thing I'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very, very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. I think there's some very, very interesting macro dynamics. I believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20 years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations, by the way, charitable foundations who also invest. So there's a very, very strong dynamic of good flows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets into private asset classes. And so we believe that's firmly intact. There's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. I would say it was extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021 and very, very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodated. But there's no question that all of this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher. The one thing I know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets, and the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses, and they also make money when they buy new assets. They obviously have to buy new assets at different valuations with different financing costs now. And what I'd say is for the last six quarters, the last 1.5 years, that community has been very quiet. In our dialogue, they are starting to see more interesting opportunities. And I would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again, both in terms of sales. It's one of the reasons why I'm optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activities look forward over the course of the next four to eight quarters but also in terms of new purchases. I'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. That would not be the norm, but if you look at kind of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity, the sponsor activity would make up, I would expect that you'll see it go back to those averages. And at the moment, we're well below those averages at the current point in time.\nSteven Chubak: Very helpful, David. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning, David and Denis. Thanks for taking my questions I'd love to start on expenses and comp, and David, you just spoke a little to this when answering Steven's question. But the comp ratio, we saw revenue growth broadly quarter-over-quarter and yet the comp ratio ticked up, which is rather unusual for Goldman. Denis, I know you layered in that there was nearly $300 million of severance year-to-date. Was some of that in the third quarter or was there any unusual items impacting the comp ratio? Or was this mostly just because of the competition for talent? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: So in terms of third quarter, it was very, very small. We previously disclosed $260 million of severance so there's a small amount of severance in the quarter. We just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it so you can track that over the course of the year. That obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of what we're thinking for the full year. And we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people. And we're looking in top composition this being mindful that we continue to pay for performance, but also recognizing, in particular, across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in Global Banking & Markets, record year-to-date financing activity, record management fees year-to-date, record private banking and lending activities year-to-date. And these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future. And we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that, Denis. And then when you're thinking about -- thanks for all the color on those CRE and the exposures. When you're thinking about these historical principal investments that you're intending to continue to sell by the end of next year, what portion of those are CRE or CRE-related? Is it possible to give any color around the assets that you're looking to sell and how exposed they are to CRE or other sectors?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So I made a comment earlier. If you look at aggregate CRE-related on-balance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans, debt securities, equity securities, and remaining exposure of equity in our CIE portfolio, that, in aggregate, now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion and down already $5 billion year-to-date. There are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our firm-wide activities, our CRA obligations and some co-invest exposures. If you look at the -- in aggregate, about 43% of the CRE on-balance sheet investments is HPI, and that's what we're looking to sell down over time.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for that color.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. The pivot's not new. It's been advertised. I guess what's new is the actual losses. So looking back, who is accountable and who pays the price for the losses with GreenSky, the Marcus loans and a consumer expansion strategy that was wider than you want it to be now? And then looking ahead, once you eliminate what you want to eliminate both on the consumer side and principal investments, how much would that alone improve ROE? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. The leadership of the firm, which includes myself and the other senior leadership, are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and for our people. So obviously, we're responsible and accountable for any decision that we make. I said publicly before that I'm happy that we pivoted. As you say, the pivot is not new. We've made the pivot. We said we were going to do certain things. With hindsight, you will do certain things differently. We obviously reflect. We learn from the things that we do. But I think it's important for companies to try things, for companies to learn and adapt. When you make a decision that you think is a wrong decision for shareholders and the firm, you adjust accordingly. So we're doing that and we're moving forward. The second part of the question was?\nMike Mayo: How much does ROE improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining consumer businesses you want to get rid of?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think we've given you a bunch of transparency, Mike, just looking at this. But if you look at what created a drag to ROE this quarter, 75% of the drag to ROE this quarter were the impairments and the rough [indiscernible] on the historical principal investments. And if you look over the last few quarters, the most significant impact on ROE performance has been the historical principal investments. Now also, there were benefits from those historical principal investments historically. But in this environment, obviously, you don't see that. We think it's a better business to release that capital and run a fund business, a lower capital fund business, and so we're driving that. I think earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the banking and markets business. You can see the banking and markets ROE right now and also the forward ROE of the Asset & Wealth Management business with less capital in it. The drag from the platforms is getting smaller. And over the next 12 to 24 months, it will get smaller, too, hopefully eradicated. And so that will give you a cleaner ROE that we continue to believe can be mid-teens through the cycle.\nMike Mayo: And then what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks? Basel III, of course. But to the extent that you're discarding of the principal investments, that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere. Kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So I think Denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've built a pretty big cushion and buffer, given that we successfully reduced our SCD based on actions we're taking. We think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more benefit to SCD. Now obviously, Basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity. But we will continue to buy back stock. We will continue to pay our dividend. And as we have clarity under this strategy, there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately benefit to further buyback. But at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we flow ahead.\nMike Mayo: All right thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. The floor is yours.\nRyan Kenny: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets, maybe asked another way. So trading revenues are clearly extremely strong. Industry wallet and both fixed income and equities is tracking well above pre-pandemic levels, and you've been taking share. But looking forward, is there any scenario related to Basel Endgame where we see industry wallet size shrink? And as you think about higher for longer rates, how do you expect that, that impacts the various trading businesses?\nDavid Solomon: Look, I think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world continues. The growth of the government in the world continues. The market capital world continues to grow and expand. I can't and I won't speculate on exactly where the final Basel rules wind up and how everyone optimizes through all that, but I don't think anything is changing in intermediation. And the need to finance the positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing. And so I continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprint and are in a leading position in these markets businesses, I think they're very well positioned in these market businesses. Of course, there will be ups and downs in those businesses. But I think the businesses will continue to perform very, very well.\nRyan Kenny: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Thank you. Good morning, David and Denis. Want to come back to Wealth Management. I know that the sale of Personal Financial Management is a small business. But just if you can remind us how and where you want to compete in Wealth Management moving forward. And David, maybe give a little more color on some of those growth opportunities you alluded to that you're seeing there across the globe. Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So I appreciate that question, Devin. Our focus is on ultra-high net worth management where we have a leading franchise. I just highlight that ultra-high net worth management -- high net worth wealth management is still a very fragmented business. And while we have a leading franchise, leading franchise is kind of mid-single-digit share and we have less share than that in places like Europe around the world. We've seen really good growth in Europe. We see continued growth in the US. We have an ability as we put more resources on the ground and invest in more resources to cover clients to continue to grow that business. We've seen good growth over the last five years. I think we have neat run rate room to do that. One of the decisions we made, and again, this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned is by selling United Capital and selling PFM, which was a small business, as you highlight, it allows us to take the resources and the investment we might have geared towards growing that and add it to our investment in ultra-high net worth growth. And we think that's a better returning business and something we're very confident that we can continue to execute on.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. And then just a quick follow-up. So the $15 billion capital call facilities with Signature Bank, it sounds like you think that could help gain share with alternative asset managers. And you framed out obviously why that's such an important customer base for Goldman Sachs. So if you can, maybe give us a little flavor for how that's going to help drive market share and how you think about where you sit with sponsorships, given how important they are as a customer for Wall Street, whether you have any sense of like where you are in the top three or where you can go from three to number one? Or just any flavor for where your market share opportunities exist there?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. In traditional investment banking services, we have leading share with sponsors across M&A and leveraged finance. These capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business. And while we've been in the business of capital facilities, it is an area of growth for us, an area of lending growth for us. One of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us where we haven't been a lender and we haven't been engaged in this activity, and it gives us an attachment to them. So this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we run meaningfully. Again, I made this comment when we were talking about the Global Banking & Markets business, financing your clients strengthens your overall position with them because the financing is important to them. And so as we continue to finance sponsors, I think it strengthens ready, very strong position with the sponsor community.\nDevin Ryan: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Platform Solutions. So for the quarter, if we exclude the write-down, is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? And as you think about achieving your target of profitability in this business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? And if you could also just give an outlook for Transaction Banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thank you for the question. I don't think it's the right run rate. I think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efficiency with respect to expenses. So I think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. I think on Transaction Banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. We had grown quickly. We're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high-quality deposits. As you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially, I think, reasonably in line with the industry, given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. But we did grow our client count. We remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall Investment Banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. And as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of alternatives and the fundraising at the private equity challenges. But maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that you're in the market with today. And then also, as you think about the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives, how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward? And when should we start to see those become a more material component of the overall revenue profile?\nDenis Coleman: So on the alternative space, our fundraising activity, $15 billion in the quarter, $40 billion year-to-date has been broad-based. We have a broad-based platform. We have mentioned the secondaries fund. David covered some of the private credit spaces. These are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. They're particularly relevant. We expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly. Incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start to distribute carry. So incentive fees will be lumpy. It will depend on the performance of different funds, but we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. When we laid out at Investor Day the building blocks for our performance in the segment, we put on the page, not only the top line target information that David covered earlier, but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. So I think that's a source of upside for us.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis. David, in the past, you -- and you talked about the IPOs, the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter. But in the past, you talked about green shoots, and part of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they wanted to go public, they're going to have to recognize that the valuations today are far below where they were in 2021 at the peak of the cycle. Are you finding those conversations easier today or are you finding more people are recognizing that's correct? And if they want to go public, they just had to accept it?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think absolutely, they're easier. And if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the valuation now. But I don't think those discussions are difficult. I think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them. And I think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to enhance themselves strategically.\nDenis Coleman: And Gerard, I'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have numerous real data points in market, both space for equities and across the leveraged finance space. So the conversations that we're having with our clients now who are looking to access the markets. They're informed by our leading role in insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. And so I think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market and what types of terms and pricing.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, it's not a big line item obviously for you folks. But can you share with us some of the color in the Transaction Banking area? That was obviously a new business line that you guys created. Just how is it going? I saw the revenues were down slightly, I think, sequentially. But what's going on in that line of business? And again, granted it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. No. Thanks, Gerard. Our Transaction Banking activity remains a strategic focus. The revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those things are linked. We have grown our client count, and we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term. No change in strategy.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. The floor is yours.\nSaul Martinez: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on Platform Solutions. I think, Denis, you mentioned that this quarter isn't necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues. But even this quarter, if I adjust for the loan markdown and the impairment, it seems like you -- my math is correct, you are PPNR positive. Obviously, credit costs are high, the credit card book is seasoning and you're still growing that portfolio. But if you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting back to -- or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next, say, 24 months?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks, Saul. So just a couple of things on glide path to help with the question in the context. So rate of growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very, very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with CECL. We expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further, and that has some positive impacts. And then as David mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional. I mean, we're working very, very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. We remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efficiency for the platforms for our clients and for Goldman Sachs. I think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with we manage the expense and the operating efficiency.\nSaul Martinez: Okay, that's helpful. And just maybe a quick follow-up there. I think you mentioned that NCOs, net charge-offs, were down this quarter. Is that -- and you do have a 13.3 reserve coverage. It does seem like your maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning to come down quite a bit, especially under CECL. But just maybe just give us a sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. And is my assessment right that your reserving could -- especially if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years?\nDenis Coleman: So you have a couple of facts that are right. We did have a charge-off ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8 to 5.1 and lower charge-offs. We are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. It's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. We do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3 is appropriate, and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. So as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-offs. And as you look at our reporting on that with GreenSky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform, and we do expect that will show elevated charge-offs.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question, we'll return to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Just a clarification on my prior question. So if I have this right, you reduced your PE investments by $3 billion quarter-over-quarter, and that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the Asset Management and Wealth segment. I mean, is that completely correlated. So if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal investments, would that free up, say, $16 billion? Is that ballpark right?\nDenis Coleman: No. Mike, I think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time, we gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. So I don't think -- I'd be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers, but I don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the forward, significantly less than that.\nMike Mayo: So how much do you have left that once you discard the $21 billion that remains, how much capital should be freed up?\nDenis Coleman: I mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to give you a sense. So we probably have remaining mid-single digits.\nMike Mayo: Okay. And as far as the comp ratio, should we consider these onetime charges as part of comp or would that be excluded when we think about our models?\nDenis Coleman: So we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. We do think of them as more onetime in nature. We, as you know, did a headcount reduction earlier in this year. That's not our current expectation to repeat that. If anything, we think that the work we've done to right-size the firm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our headcount on the forward. So we don't expect that type of severance to repeat itself. And we are taking into account as we set the compensation ratio, that severance payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the firm. We're very focused on pertaining to continue to drive the franchise.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good morning, everybody. Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd just like to take a moment to address the horrific events in the Middle East. We condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel on the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss of so many innocent lives. This is clearly an extremely difficult and uncertain time for the region, and it's very concerning for many of us around the world. We obviously will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds. Earlier this month, I marked the end of my fifth year as the CEO of Goldman Sachs. I've never felt more optimistic about the firm, and our strategy has never been more clear. We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking & Markets franchise, and our growing Asset & Wealth Management platform, both of which are being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle. As I reflect on the past five years, much of what has always made Goldman Sachs extraordinary remains the same, long track record of being a trusted adviser to the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals. A global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions, an aspirational brand, exceptional people and a culture of collaboration and excellence. Additionally, over this time, we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. This approach, coupled with our best-in-class talent, advice and execution capabilities has strengthened and solidified our leadership position across our businesses. As we sit here today, our client franchise is as strong as ever, enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions for our clients. For example, the IPO market has started to reopen. Since Labor Day, there have been four marquee IPOs priced in the United States, Arm Holdings, Instacart, Klaviyo and Birkenstock. Goldman Sachs was lead left on three of those four and the joint lead book runner on the fourth. No other bank can make that claim. Being entrusted to help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market requires long-standing client relationships, deep market expertise and experience. Given the execution of these transactions, I'm encouraged by the prospects of a wider reopening of capital markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect the continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic activity. As a leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity would be a tail [indiscernible] of Goldman Sachs. In Asset & Wealth Management, our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes we've seen across our franchise. While some active asset managers have faced quarterly outflows over the last few years, we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We generated record management and other fees of $2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target to 2024. We are also ahead of pace on our $2 billion target for alternative management fees. While market-leading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength, we know we still have work ahead of us. Earlier this year at Investor Day, we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus, and we have made significant progress on these priorities. Most recently, we announced the sale of GreenSky. We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer. We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. We have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We are confident that the work we're doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter. On top of that, recent inflation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in financial conditions we've seen over the last quarter. At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conflict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned. Before I turn it over to Denis, I'd like to spend a moment on Basel III Endgame proposal and reiterate my views on it. We, of course, support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound financial system. There are some who have recently said we need to address the lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, which is driving the needs of much higher regulations. But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital over the last 15 years, have improved the quality of capital, increased liquidity, simplified businesses that have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests. Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences. I believe if these rules are implemented, three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all sizes from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector. Policies that incentivize a transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could, in fact, increase systemic risk. And third, US competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world. They're the engine of our economy as access to capital allows for innovation and growth across the country. Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal. The net result of these proposed rules would be slower economic growth in the US, material improvement in the -- soundness of the banking system. We, alongside clients and others in the industry, have been engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders, and given this engagement, we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately, changes to the proposed rules. Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain top of mind, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business, and we remain firmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover financial results for the quarter. Sure, Glenn, and appreciate the question. And so we'll keep it high level and let's separate into what we've got and then we can have a separate discussion about Basel III. But first, we are simplifying the firm and kind of managing the firm to drive us toward the overwhelming majority of the firm to be in two core businesses, our Global Banking & Markets franchise, which is performing very well in an environment that's not a great environment for that business. Investment Banking activities are well below 10-year norms. I don't think that will stay that way. But if you look at the performance of the business through nine months, that business, which is kind of 7% of the firm, that is two-thirds to 70% of the firm, that business is operating with a 13.4% ROE and an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business. I can't tell you when the environment will get better, but I do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years. History tells us that it doesn't stay short -- it doesn't stay closed for multiple years at a time. There is an adjustment. We're making the adjustment. Yes, the world's uncertain. As we mentioned, that could be a headwind. But I do think it will improve. And that business performs well. And we firmly believe that, that business is a mid-teens through the cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet shares, the way we've grown our financing footprint, which adds more balance to the business and with our market-leading franchises across that business. Second, we have the Asset & Wealth Management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal and make it a lower capital business. We're on that journey. I think you see us making progress. We've talked about how we've reduced the historical principal businesses -- the historical principal investments by $9 billion this year. We set a target for $15 billion by next year, which we'll meet and then close to zero two years later. And so that business, we have a high degree of confidence we'll operate at mid-teens or higher as we reposition it. As we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. We're narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag. And we're relatively confident that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in that. So you add that up with what we have and I think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target. Now, the Basel rules. The Basel rules, if they were implemented as they're position now would be a headwind to that but also that doesn't account for how we optimize and how we pass through pricing. We've seen things before. I'm not to saying it won't be a headwind, but I don't want to speculate on what it would do to our targets until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it. So we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders. And when there's more clarity on Basel, we're committed to giving you a clear picture of that view. But I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. I'm not saying you are. I wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. Yes. Glenn, as I listened to you play it back, what I'd say, US economy has been more resilient. The fiscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. I'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy, we will see more sluggishness. Now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly, there's a good debate on where this all lands. But we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. And I just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy, not all, but most sectors of the economy. And I do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. I am hearing as I interact with CEOs, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. I don't want to over-amplify that because I think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. But I think that gear from watching closely. Sure. So in our Global Banking & Markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on our execution to continue to grow our wallet share. We expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts, and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one, two or three as opposed to just top three. And so we still do see some wallet share opportunities but we obviously have a very strong wallet share. So that's not most significant. We are growing our financing for our Global Banking & Markets franchise, and we expect to continue to grow that financing footprint, and we have a plan to continue to put more financial resources toward growing that financing footprint. And we do think that it has reasonable returns. And it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a significant financer with them. When you turn to Asset & Wealth Management, I think we've been very clear at our Investor Day, and Mark stated this, that we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high single-digits. That is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and the continued growth in the wealth management sector, where we are experiencing good growth, and we still see good opportunities in Wealth Management to grow the franchise all over the world. And we've made continued progress on that journey. When you talk about private credit, we have, as you know, over $100 billion of private credit. We've launched private credit vehicles. We obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at Global Banking & Markets. And what we do with financing, which we think can also be an Asset & Wealth Management opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect significant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise. So those are a handful of things I'd highlight at this point. Sure, Christian. I appreciate it. I mean, I'm going to talk very high level because, again, this is all fluid. But obviously, if these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an effect of the businesses. But it's different from business to business. There are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end users, whether they're corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you'd pass on cost. A corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative. I can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher. Obviously, it's some balance, they would think about that differently. There are certain businesses where we might reduce our activity level because with the new Basel rules, the terms don't look attractive. But there are others, and one I'd point to that's most obvious, which by the way, a significant part of the impact to us would be is prime, okay? There aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business. There are very few in Europe, a little bit, and obviously, the Europeans, if this was implemented this way, would have an advantage. But at the end of the day, there are a handful of scale players. There are lots of scale institutions that need that service. Our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way. We'd have to look at the final rules. We'd have to adjust. So it will affect behavior. It will affect pricing. It will affect optimization. But I know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer, I think you need to see the rules, and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality, whatever it is. And it's not binary that it only affects us or others in the industry that are obviously be a process of working through that, as we have in the past. All right. I'll start on the first part, Denis will make some comments on credit and the portfolio. First, I think we hired a gentleman, Bill Johnson, who's got decades of experience to help us better run and better optimize the credit card portfolio, the credit card partnerships. As we've stated to you a number of times, and I'll repeat it here very clearly, we've worked to narrow our focus. You've seen us execute around Marcus loans and GreenSky. Our partnerships with Apple and GM are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships. So our focus at the moment is on managing them better, getting rid of the drag and bringing them to profitability. And we're making progress, both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. And Bill Johnson joining is helping with all that. We'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine what's best in the long run for Goldman Sachs. But our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next 12 to 24 months and ensuring we operate them better. Denis, do you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing? Yes. So we continue to be committed to the 60% efficiency ratio. But as you know, we're moving through, we're narrowing our focus. We're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on, Steven, and highlight for you. I'm going to turn to Denis to make sure that we get the number right. But ex those one-off items, the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been? Okay. So putting it in perspective, I think it's important to highlight that we don't think the things that we're highlighting continue in perpetuity. We're trying to narrow the focus and when we look at our Global Banking & Markets business and our Asset & Wealth Management platform, we think we have the right target. Now back to your point, Steve, about competition. The competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains very, very strong. And so we think we've got a very, very good talent ecosystem. I feel good about the hiring we're doing. I'd just highlight that for our analyst jobs out of university, we had 260,000 applications for approximately 2,600 jobs. There are over 1 million applications for employment at Goldman Sachs last year. Very, very aspirational and desirous place to work, but the competition for talent remains high. And so we'll strike the right balance and making an investment in our talent. You heard Denis talk about some of our efficiencies and the fact that the efficiencies allow us to make a reinvestment in some of our best talent. We feel good about where we are, but we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy, which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, that the efficiency ratio target that we're hiring -- that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target. Sure. So that broadly defined sponsor community, Steven, which really is the broad alternatives world, private capital world, the first thing I'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very, very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. I think there's some very, very interesting macro dynamics. I believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20 years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations, by the way, charitable foundations who also invest. So there's a very, very strong dynamic of good flows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets into private asset classes. And so we believe that's firmly intact. There's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. I would say it was extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021 and very, very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodated. But there's no question that all of this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher. The one thing I know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets, and the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses, and they also make money when they buy new assets. They obviously have to buy new assets at different valuations with different financing costs now. And what I'd say is for the last six quarters, the last 1.5 years, that community has been very quiet. In our dialogue, they are starting to see more interesting opportunities. And I would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again, both in terms of sales. It's one of the reasons why I'm optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activities look forward over the course of the next four to eight quarters but also in terms of new purchases. I'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. That would not be the norm, but if you look at kind of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity, the sponsor activity would make up, I would expect that you'll see it go back to those averages. And at the moment, we're well below those averages at the current point in time. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. The leadership of the firm, which includes myself and the other senior leadership, are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and for our people. So obviously, we're responsible and accountable for any decision that we make. I said publicly before that I'm happy that we pivoted. As you say, the pivot is not new. We've made the pivot. We said we were going to do certain things. With hindsight, you will do certain things differently. We obviously reflect. We learn from the things that we do. But I think it's important for companies to try things, for companies to learn and adapt. When you make a decision that you think is a wrong decision for shareholders and the firm, you adjust accordingly. So we're doing that and we're moving forward. The second part of the question was? Well, I think we've given you a bunch of transparency, Mike, just looking at this. But if you look at what created a drag to ROE this quarter, 75% of the drag to ROE this quarter were the impairments and the rough [indiscernible] on the historical principal investments. And if you look over the last few quarters, the most significant impact on ROE performance has been the historical principal investments. Now also, there were benefits from those historical principal investments historically. But in this environment, obviously, you don't see that. We think it's a better business to release that capital and run a fund business, a lower capital fund business, and so we're driving that. I think earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the banking and markets business. You can see the banking and markets ROE right now and also the forward ROE of the Asset & Wealth Management business with less capital in it. The drag from the platforms is getting smaller. And over the next 12 to 24 months, it will get smaller, too, hopefully eradicated. And so that will give you a cleaner ROE that we continue to believe can be mid-teens through the cycle. Yes. So I think Denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. We've built a pretty big cushion and buffer, given that we successfully reduced our SCD based on actions we're taking. We think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more benefit to SCD. Now obviously, Basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity. But we will continue to buy back stock. We will continue to pay our dividend. And as we have clarity under this strategy, there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately benefit to further buyback. But at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we flow ahead. Look, I think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world continues. The growth of the government in the world continues. The market capital world continues to grow and expand. I can't and I won't speculate on exactly where the final Basel rules wind up and how everyone optimizes through all that, but I don't think anything is changing in intermediation. And the need to finance the positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing. And so I continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprint and are in a leading position in these markets businesses, I think they're very well positioned in these market businesses. Of course, there will be ups and downs in those businesses. But I think the businesses will continue to perform very, very well. Yes. So I appreciate that question, Devin. Our focus is on ultra-high net worth management where we have a leading franchise. I just highlight that ultra-high net worth management -- high net worth wealth management is still a very fragmented business. And while we have a leading franchise, leading franchise is kind of mid-single-digit share and we have less share than that in places like Europe around the world. We've seen really good growth in Europe. We see continued growth in the US. We have an ability as we put more resources on the ground and invest in more resources to cover clients to continue to grow that business. We've seen good growth over the last five years. I think we have neat run rate room to do that. One of the decisions we made, and again, this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned is by selling United Capital and selling PFM, which was a small business, as you highlight, it allows us to take the resources and the investment we might have geared towards growing that and add it to our investment in ultra-high net worth growth. And we think that's a better returning business and something we're very confident that we can continue to execute on. Sure. In traditional investment banking services, we have leading share with sponsors across M&A and leveraged finance. These capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business. And while we've been in the business of capital facilities, it is an area of growth for us, an area of lending growth for us. One of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us where we haven't been a lender and we haven't been engaged in this activity, and it gives us an attachment to them. So this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we run meaningfully. Again, I made this comment when we were talking about the Global Banking & Markets business, financing your clients strengthens your overall position with them because the financing is important to them. And so as we continue to finance sponsors, I think it strengthens ready, very strong position with the sponsor community. Yes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think absolutely, they're easier. And if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the valuation now. But I don't think those discussions are difficult. I think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them. And I think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to enhance themselves strategically."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $11.8 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in a [indiscernible] and a return on equity of 7.1%. As David highlighted, earlier this year, we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus, and we made strong progress across a number of activities. We provide details on the financial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE by 3.1 percentage points. These items include results related to our historical principal investments within Asset & Wealth Management, including the net impact of marks, sell-downs and CIE impairments as well as results relating to GreenSky, which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally, we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page four. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million, though industry volumes remained well below medium and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to-date, we ranked Number One in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and ranked number two in high-yield debt. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated, and our best-in-class franchise remains well positioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets. FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from a strong performance last year, particularly in currency and commodities and up relative to the second quarter. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $730 million grow sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally, we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, totaling just over $15 billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September. As we spoke about at our Investor Day, alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us, and the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, who we can serve even more holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives, while equities financing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower versus a record in quarter. Total financing revenues across FICC and Equities were nearly $6 billion for the year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our financing results, combined with the substantial share gains we've made since our first Investor Day are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. We are raising the floor in Global Banking & Markets as reflected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across Investment Banking. Now moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page five. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year, as higher deposit balances and spreads were offset by our sale of substantially all of the market loan portfolio. We remain very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period. Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results for Marcus loans negatively impacted our 6% pre-tax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. We saw $11 billion of liquidity inflows and $7 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $542 million of management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of Goldman Sachs Vintage Fund IX in the third quarter, our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter, we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. We are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions, page eight. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by a $637 million associated reserve release as we moved the portfolio to held for sale. On page nine firm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter, down sequentially as increased funding cost supported trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, flat with the prior quarter. Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio, offset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments were partially offset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter. On page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter. CRE loans continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions, with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have marked or impaired office-related exposures by approximately 50% this year. Now turning to expenses on page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies to be achieved in 2023 and 2024 and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efficiencies allow us to reinvest in our highest performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains fiercely competitive. Quarterly non-compensation expense were $0.9 billion. The year-over-year increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in the intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE impairments of $358 million. While onetime expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to focus on bringing down noncomp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efficiency goal. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, high versus the first half due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of under 23%. Now onto slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter. We remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield. In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Sure. So, yes, to clarify, for our CRE and CIE exposure in the office space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year. So that's -- I think that's quite significant. We started the year with about $15 billion of CRE alternative investments. That's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. So we're making very, very significant progress against those exposures. If you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-office, the adjustment there through marks, our impairment is about 15% year-to-date. So we feel we've reduced a lot of notional appropriately reflected the valuations in those positions. But as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures. Sure. What I'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. A couple of things to bear in mind. In Consumer, the net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter and the total dollar amount of charge-offs down as well. You'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio. That adjustment is basically a function of GreenSky being removed from that ratio. And so now that applies to the cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now. On the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. We made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment. About 64.6%. So in terms of third quarter, it was very, very small. We previously disclosed $260 million of severance so there's a small amount of severance in the quarter. We just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it so you can track that over the course of the year. That obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of what we're thinking for the full year. And we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people. And we're looking in top composition this being mindful that we continue to pay for performance, but also recognizing, in particular, across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in Global Banking & Markets, record year-to-date financing activity, record management fees year-to-date, record private banking and lending activities year-to-date. And these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future. And we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future. Sure. So I made a comment earlier. If you look at aggregate CRE-related on-balance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans, debt securities, equity securities, and remaining exposure of equity in our CIE portfolio, that, in aggregate, now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion and down already $5 billion year-to-date. There are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our firm-wide activities, our CRA obligations and some co-invest exposures. If you look at the -- in aggregate, about 43% of the CRE on-balance sheet investments is HPI, and that's what we're looking to sell down over time. Sure. Thank you for the question. I don't think it's the right run rate. I think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efficiency with respect to expenses. So I think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. I think on Transaction Banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. We had grown quickly. We're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high-quality deposits. As you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially, I think, reasonably in line with the industry, given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. But we did grow our client count. We remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall Investment Banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for Goldman Sachs. So on the alternative space, our fundraising activity, $15 billion in the quarter, $40 billion year-to-date has been broad-based. We have a broad-based platform. We have mentioned the secondaries fund. David covered some of the private credit spaces. These are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. They're particularly relevant. We expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly. Incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start to distribute carry. So incentive fees will be lumpy. It will depend on the performance of different funds, but we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. When we laid out at Investor Day the building blocks for our performance in the segment, we put on the page, not only the top line target information that David covered earlier, but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. So I think that's a source of upside for us. And Gerard, I'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have numerous real data points in market, both space for equities and across the leveraged finance space. So the conversations that we're having with our clients now who are looking to access the markets. They're informed by our leading role in insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. And so I think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market and what types of terms and pricing. Sure. No. Thanks, Gerard. Our Transaction Banking activity remains a strategic focus. The revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those things are linked. We have grown our client count, and we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term. No change in strategy. Sure. Thanks, Saul. So just a couple of things on glide path to help with the question in the context. So rate of growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very, very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with CECL. We expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further, and that has some positive impacts. And then as David mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional. I mean, we're working very, very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. We remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efficiency for the platforms for our clients and for Goldman Sachs. I think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with we manage the expense and the operating efficiency. So you have a couple of facts that are right. We did have a charge-off ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8 to 5.1 and lower charge-offs. We are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. It's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. We do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3 is appropriate, and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. So as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-offs. And as you look at our reporting on that with GreenSky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform, and we do expect that will show elevated charge-offs. No. Mike, I think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time, we gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. So I don't think -- I'd be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers, but I don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the forward, significantly less than that. I mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to give you a sense. So we probably have remaining mid-single digits. So we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. We do think of them as more onetime in nature. We, as you know, did a headcount reduction earlier in this year. That's not our current expectation to repeat that. If anything, we think that the work we've done to right-size the firm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our headcount on the forward. So we don't expect that type of severance to repeat itself. And we are taking into account as we set the compensation ratio, that severance payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the firm. We're very focused on pertaining to continue to drive the franchise."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, July 19, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Thank you. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note, [indiscernible] this information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Solomon. Let me pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, Carey and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%. Our results were impacted by several items related to businesses we are executing on a strategic transition and positioning the firm for the future. In particular, shifting our asset wealth management business to a less capital-intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition. All in, these items reduced our EPS for the second quarter by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Our results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular, headwinds facing our specific mix of businesses. Activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows and clients largely maintained a risk-off posture over the course of the quarter. CEOs around the world continue to be cautious as businesses grapple with persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions and slower growth. But we know the corporate activity and capital formation are core to our financial system and there are a number of structural catalysts that should lead to increased levels of activity. And we're seeing it begin to pick up in a few spots already, particularly equity capital markets and M&A dialogue. There's no question, recent economic data in the U.S. indicates the Fed's efforts to fight inflation are showing progress and we are starting to see more optimism about the forward trajectory. However, the year unfolds, we stand ready to help our clients navigate the evolving backdrop while maintaining a prudent risk posture and operating the firm more efficiently. Importantly, we laid out a clear set of strategic goals at our Investor Day in February and we are in execution mode. We have 2 incredibly strong client franchises a world-class global banking and markets business, we continue to deliver solid returns even in an environment with reduced activity levels and a scaled asset and wealth management platform that continues to show very strong underlying trends aligned with our Investor Day goals with growth and more recurring revenues of management and other fees and private banking and lending. These businesses are supported by a number of things. First, a long track record of serving the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals, building relationships as a trusted adviser is core to what Goldman Sachs does. Next, the client-centric mindset. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our efforts to bring to bear the best of the firm's capabilities and holistically serve clients with our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. Client feedback continues to be highly encouraging and we see opportunities to make further gains. We also have a global, broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions a key differentiator of value to our clients around the world. We have exceptional people. They are differentiated and they work hard to make a difference for our clients. And lastly, this is all underpinned by a culture of collaboration and excellence. We are also pleased that our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business and multiyear progress, deploy our capital. We continue to execute on the $30 billion share repurchase program we announced in February and we recently announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend. We have made it a priority to grow our dividend to a competitive rate. And since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our dividend from $0.80 to $2.75 per share per quarter. Given our ongoing strategic efforts to lower the firm's capital density and reduce earnings volatility, we are well positioned to grow it further. As I said, we are laser focused on executing on our strategy. This moment in the economic cycle creates meaningful headwinds for Goldman Sachs and our business mix. At the same time, we are making tough decisions that are driving the strategic evolution of the firm. Given both these factors, that should come as no surprise that we're going to a period of lower results. I remain fully confident that we will deliver on our through-the-cycle targets of mid-teens returns on at significant value for shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $10.9 million [ph] and net earnings of $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.08. As David mentioned, we have provided additional detail this quarter on 3 items that impacted our results. These items are a gain in connection with our sale process for the market's unsecured loan portfolio as well as the business' operating results. Losses from our historical principal investments within Asset and Wealth Management and results related to GreenSky, including a goodwill impairment in consumer platforms. In aggregate, for the second quarter, these 3 items impacted net earnings by $1.4 billion and reduced our EPS by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 4; Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Advisory revenues of $645 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid significantly lower industry completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $338 million as we saw some signs of reopening in the capital markets, although volumes continue to remain well below medium and long-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues were slightly down versus the second quarter of 2022 as activity remains muted. Nonetheless, our client franchise remains very strong and we remain well positioned to support the needs of our clients. We ranked number one in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and high-yield debt on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, primarily in advisory. Fixed net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter as clients remained in a risk-off posture, relative to an active prior year quarter, particularly in commodities, rates and currencies. Fixed financing revenues were $622 million. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-on-year. Equities financing revenues were a record $1.4 billion as we benefited from our ongoing strategic focus and increased balances. This was largely offset by a decline in intermediation revenues, primarily in derivatives. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both second equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base and we continue to see attractive deployment opportunities to support further growth. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5; revenues of $3 billion were down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity and debt investments. Management and other fees increased 5% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher assets under supervision. Private Banking and lending revenues were also a record at $874 million. We continue to see positive momentum in this business as we benefit from higher deposit balances and NII. Results were supported by a gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of substantially all of the remaining Marcus loans portfolio. Equity investments generated losses of $403 million. More specifically, we had roughly $305 million of net losses in our private portfolio, primarily due to markdowns on investments in office-related commercial real estate and approximately $100 million of net losses in our public portfolio, largely driven by a loss related to a historical principal investment that we sold out of during the quarter. Importantly, we have now reduced the public portfolio to approximately $1 billion, down from more than $4.5 billion in 2021. Debt investments revenues were $197 million, with the year-over-year decline driven by weaker performance in real estate investments. This quarter, we also experienced approximately $485 million of impairments on our real estate-related CIE portfolio which are reflected in operating expenses. In aggregate, the results from Marcus loans and the losses from our historical principal investments negatively impacted our margins for the segment by approximately 15 percentage points for the first half of the year. Now moving to Page 6; total firm with assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $30 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows and representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning now to Page 7 on alternatives; alternative assets on supervision totaled $267 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $521 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $11 billion for the quarter and $25 billion for the first half of the year. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now over $200 billion and remains very well positioned to achieve our 2024 target of $225 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $53 billion, of which $24 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we reduced this portfolio by $3.6 billion which included sales of a number of CRE-related investments, bringing year-to-date reductions to approximately $6 billion and putting us well on pace to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8; revenues were $659 million, driven by growth in loan balances and consumer platforms. As noted earlier, we took a $504 million impairment charge on the goodwill associated with consumer platforms this quarter in connection our exploration of a potential sale of the GreenSky business. We will continue to evaluate its intangibles for impairment and should we decide to sell the business, we will also make a determination regarding moving Greensky to held for sale, similar to the action we took last quarter with respect to our markets unsecured loan portfolio. We will share further updates as appropriate. Additionally, you'll recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we said that we expected to reduce the efficiency ratio in Platform Solutions below 100% by the end of this year and we are making progress. Absent the impact of the goodwill impairment in consumer platforms, the efficiency ratio for the segment year-to-date would have been better than our stated goal. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, unchanged versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $615 million. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to continued growth and higher net charge-offs in our lending portfolio within consumer platforms. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments and a reserve build were partially offset by releases due to lower balances. Moving on to Page 10; we've added a new slide this quarter, providing additional detail on our CRE exposure. Starting with the left side of the page, CRE loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book, roughly 15%. And we are well diversified by property type with only 1% in the office category. Moving to the right side of the page, you can see additional detail on our CRE-related on-balance sheet alternative investments. We conducted a comprehensive asset-by-asset review of this portfolio this quarter and we have incorporated the feedback from our sell-down process. Office-related exposure represents approximately 2% of the aggregate portfolio and equity securities loans and debt securities and approximately 15% of the CIE investments in other category net of financings. Overall, the CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Furthermore, 50% of these investments are historical principal investments that we intend to exit over the medium term. We continue to remain highly focused on the overall risk management of this portfolio. Turning to expenses on Page 11; total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 34% which includes approximately $260 million of year-to-date state severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated this year and we have now largely reached this organ with line of sight to surpass it. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion. The increase in our non-compensation expense was entirely driven by the CIE and goodwill impairments I discussed previously. Absent these items, non-comp expense is down for the second consecutive quarter, even in the face of inflationary headwinds. Our effective tax rate for the first half of '20 was an increase in taxes on non-U.S. earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of roughly 22%. Next, capital on Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach which is 190 basis points over our new 13% requirement that will become applicable in October. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the results of the recent stress test and remain confident that our strategy to reduce the capital density of our business will continue to help improve our SEB over time. The 80 basis point reduction in our SEB will allow us to continue to remain nimble in dynamically deploying capital to support our client franchise. In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $750 million and common stock dividends of $864 million. Our Board has also approved a 10% increase in our dividend, to $2.75 per share beginning in the third quarter. This increase will enable us to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a competitive yield, complemented by our previously announced $30 million share repurchase program where we intend to step up the level of buybacks going forward. In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect a challenging backdrop as well as our ongoing execution of several strategic actions. These initiatives will help transition our business and improve our overall return profile. We remain confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: So I want to talk about how we build towards that that the medium-term ROE target. So obviously, this was -- this quarter was depressed by the write-downs. Let's start with a 9-ish starting point. We know capital markets activity will be better in normal time. So I know we're a lot closer than it looks right now. If you look at Page 7, where you spelled out the $3.6 billion of historical Principal Investments that declined in the quarter. Or if you want to do it year-to-date either way. My question related to that reducing capital intensity is in a good way, it didn't look like there was a big gain or loss related to those exits. A) Is that right? And B) how much capital that free up because I'm just trying to build towards that ultimate goal.\nDenis Coleman: So Glenn, thank you for the question. And I think in terms of our journey towards our through-the-cycle returns, there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at Investor Day as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efficiency. The capital efficiency has been a project that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had particular increases in those reductions over both the first and second quarter. As you know, about HPI down $6 billion. And as we -- if we ultimately reach our target, we expect the total AE reduction to be approximately $9 billion.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. I just -- Glenn, I just want to add 2 things, just looking at that because Denise focused on the AE and the continued journey. The one thing you didn't touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there were meaningful marks around that, there are some where you're reduce where -- it might be a public physician. So we mark those public positions that market that night and you sell that position at a discount. So there could be a slight loss. There are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to what you believe it's worth as you sell and you get a gain. But I wouldn't say there's anything material that I'd call out in the context of that process. But the important thing about the journey that I'd like to emphasize is we laid out clear in Investor Day that we were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these 2 big businesses. Clearly, at this point in time, given the lack of investment banking activity, our investment banking business is performing at a lower level of return and a lower level of activity than we've seen in nearly a decade. We don't believe that's constant. We believe that, that global markets and banking business can deliver mid-teens returns through the cycle and that obviously makes up more than 2/3 of the firm. In addition, Mark Nachmann laid out at our Investor Day, a very clear path on asset management to grow the top line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high single-digit percentage and we set a target to drive the margin which ex the legacy balance sheet up to 25%. At that point, that is a mid-teens return business. And as we continue to narrow the drag which we're making progress on in the platforms and I believe we'll narrow that to 0 and move past that, you've got these 2 businesses that are the firm that will be mid-teens through the cycle. So that's the way I'd think about it. But obviously, you need a better environment in this environment to see that.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate all that. And maybe 1 just big picture. Think a lot of banks that -- investment banks that have reported over the last couple of days have had varying degrees of optimism about capital markets activity returning. And I think in typical Goldman fashion, you all have been I think, appropriately conservative over the last couple of quarters. So maybe I'll just get a mark-to-market on what green shoots you may or may not be seeing. You mentioned your advisory pipeline was up; just like kind of contextualize that, that would be great.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I'd say on the following. It definitely feels better over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks than it felt earlier in the year. And I've talked in the past on this call and other times when I've talked to many of you about the fact that when you have a big reset, it takes 5 or 6 quarters to get that reset. It's not surprising that we're kind of at 6 quarters now and you're starting to see more activity. So it's definitely been a pickup in equity capital markets activity. That definitely feels better. There's more M&A dialogue I can't tell you exactly what the journey is. But when I go back and I look historically at other periods where the macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity, they tend to last for a year or so and then they start to improve. And so I think we're starting to see that here. It definitely feels better. I think the inflation data has been better. The client sentiment is better and now we'll have to watch and see that journey. But I know this activity level of 10-year loans and investment banking activity is not going to be the normal on a forward basis.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe just the first question, when we think about potential for obviously pick up in the back half, David, as you just mentioned but give us a sense of rightsizing the business, given the slowdown that we've seen over the last year or so, -- are we there headcount-wise, infrastructure-wise, where you want it to be on the expense base and as we anchor back to the efficiency target around 60%. Just give us a sense of how you think we get there and where the where Gold minister in terms of just rightsizing the expense base?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So I think we've made -- I'll make a couple of comments and Dennis will probably add on with some more granular detail. But I think we've made progress. We set out some targets at the beginning of the year. As you heard in Dennis' prepared remarks, we have them basically accomplished in line of sight for more. You've seen our noncomp expense ex these extraordinary items around impairments have been down for the second quarter in a row. We've been very focused on that. And there's been real work done there because there's certainly inflationary pressure on a bunch of the line items that are noncomp expenses. I think that with hindsight, I'm very glad that we were early in January is starting to work on the headcount sizing. We took a couple of actions so far this year and we feel good about where we are. I'd remind everybody. And we've said this before that we are resuming our regular performance-based process that we do with compensation at the end of the year which we had stopped during the pandemic and started again next year when we go through compensation, we will do a performance review but we have no other specific plans on the headcount now. We'll watch the trajectory of revenues in the environment as we go forward. We'll always make adjustments if something changes. But as we just said, we think we're operating an extraordinarily low activities of investment banking. We're not going to erode that franchise. That is a key franchise of the firm. So this is a moment that we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover. We obviously are focused on a bunch of efficiency uplift in processes and operations. We have a big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology and we feel good about that. So we think that over time, that's or early '24 thing but we think over time, that's something else that will benefit the trajectory. Dennis, do you have some specific extent?\nDenis Coleman: I mean just to add for you. So end of the second quarter, we ended -- headcount was 44,600 down about 2% on the quarter, about 8% year-to-date. I think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-year metric of down 5% because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter. But as David said, we're happy about taking the action early in the year, positioning the firm reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And just maybe a quick follow-up. I think if I heard you correctly, you mentioned goal to maybe step up a pace of buybacks in the back half. Just if you could maybe put some numbers around that, what level of buybacks we should expect? And how big a deal is the Fed Basel NPR, from what we're hearing, it may take 6, 12 months before we know what the final rules when they incorporate industry feedback look like? So how big of an unknown that is in terms of your capital deployment plans?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So you have pieces of the answer to my question to the question for my answer. So what we would say, obviously, very pleased with the CCAR results -- we have 190 basis points of cushion. We intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to continue to grow our activities there. We announced our increase in dividend. We've been very committed to sustainably growing our dividend and we're going to increase our level of buybacks. We are mindful of Basel III revisions but we also recognize that we will get a rule. There will be a comment period for the rule. There will be a period in which that's implemented, some suggestions in the beginning of 2026. That implementation may even have a phase-in period. So as we think about the way in which we manage capital we think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders. We obviously will make sure we're in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early -- but in the intervening period, we're going to continue to manage our capital to grow the firm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders and we thought we would indicate that, that intention is to step it up from where we are.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: David, there's been a fair amount of price speculation covering how you\u2019re -- the consumer business, specifically even some recently suggesting you might look to sell some additional receivables tied to partnership with Apple and GM. I know price speculation might not be representative of what's actually being discussed. So it might be helpful just to hear about your strategic priorities for the consumer business, maybe how your vision has evolved in recent months just given some of the challenges facing that business and maybe not fitting with your -- aligning with your core competencies.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So thanks for the question. And I frame it this way. As I think you know, we made difficult but appropriate decision over a year ago, working with our Board to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out the fall, the direction of travel and have been executing on that. And that included the wind down and the execution of the markets the wind down of the execution of the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio which has now been completed and obviously exploring options for GreenSky which we've been transparent on are in the process of. We've also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are long-term partnerships. We don't have unilateral rights with them. They definitely can operate better. We've been working hard to improve the operation of them which will reduce the drag and we're making good progress on that. And we're working with Apple and also with GM to do that. And so there's a significant focus on reducing that drag. And the drag of those credit card partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into 2024. We continue to have a very strong deposit platform. We launched an Apple savings platform which also was a successful launch to grow our deposit base. And so we'll continue to grow deposits and that's the course that we're on at the moment.\nSteven Chubak: It's great color. Maybe just for my follow-up on equity financing specifically. The contribution in the first half actually implies an incremental $1 billion in fees year-on-year. You've definitely been highlighting the commitment to grow the financing piece. And just wanted to better understand, one, the durability of the gains that you saw in the first half and as we look out over the next few years, how significant of a contribution to the trading business do you expect from the financing component both across equities as well as FIC?\nDavid Solomon: So I'm going to start with a high-level just strategic view of what I think we've done and we're focused on doing and then Dennis will give you a little bit more detail. But 1 of the things -- this has been a strategic priority for us because I certainly remember going back over the last decade, there were times where we did not have the largest equity business and we were not in a position with our clients and the equity franchise that we're in now. And there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time. But we've been very focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress and growing the financing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a real difference. And so, I look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it; very good about what the team has accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients. Now broadly, that financing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue but it obviously is affected by risk on, risk off and overall market level activities. And so there can be variability in it but there's a base stability there that's much more meaningful than intermediation revenues. Dennis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that from a risk and a capital perspective.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So that is the strategic direction of travel. We are allocating a lot of time and resources, human capital, financial capital to grow those activities Equities financing revenues are nearly 50% of overall equities revenue this quarter and that's something that has been growing. Even the combined FIC and equities financing as a percentage of pick and equities continue to grow. So remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that space with clients. And we're also observing that there's a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period. It's paying dividends both across dividend and intermediation and recognizing David's comments with respect to market valuation levels which drive changes in balances and changes in behavior, there's also activities that we've been taking to sort of systematically identify components of the client base across the financing activities and make sure that we're capturing more share in underpenetrated portions of the client base. So remain committed to growing that activity. It's relatively more durable than intermediation but like other line items, it can fluctuate on the forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Just one follow-up to that last question and then a different one. But just on the last question. So you mentioned durability when you were talking about financing, that was part of what I wanted to understand. Do you feel like this quarter of financing revenue is a good jump off point for us to grow from. And if there's any puts and takes on how you would think -- how would you want us to think about that level of durability, that would be helpful.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So I'll comment both on FICC and equities. In fixed income, we had slightly softer performance over period-on-period. That was driven by a component of fixed financing which is more episodic which is commodities-based financing, those activity levels were a lot higher. And so I think you see lack of contribution from commodities-based financing activity that was in prior periods but I think the forward for other components of our fixed financing, like collateralized lending and repo, I think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to grow those types of activities. I'm always cautious about predicting growth off of record performance. We're pleased with the equities financing performance in the second quarter and we do intend to grow that from here but we'll have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of period-over-period growth but we do think there is still unaddressed market share and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues.\nBetsy Graseck: And you highlighted capital obviously have excess, significant excess. So there's that flex between buybacks versus deploy. This is an opportunity to deploy. I guess the follow-up I had to that was in your comments earlier on the Basel III end game. I think you mentioned that you -- look, you're in a position to be opportunistic, whether or not you want to meet the requirements early. And I guess that was the question I had on when you say on time, of course but early just meaning within that phase-in period early. And again, I kind of asked the question with the context of you've got this opportunity in financing. So how should I think through meeting it early versus leaning into financing versus other options you might have.\nDavid Solomon: Yes, Betsy. So look, I appreciate that. I think there's a lot that's unknown about the direction of travel on this. And we're talking about years out. And so I think Dennis' message on early was in the context of the phase-in period, making sure we were getting there on time. But no, we are focused on deploying -- we generate a lot of capital because the firm generally through the cycle generates good earnings. We are going to return a bunch of that to shareholders and there are opportunities as we're talking about to deploy that in service of plants. Given the work we've done strategically, we now have much greater flexibility which gives us the option to look sharply as some of the deployment opportunities where maybe 6 to 12 months ago, we felt we needed to be more cautious. And at the same point, we have more capacity, as Dennis said, to step up buybacks. You should view that we're very, very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders and we'll be very thoughtful about the adjustment phase in of whatever comes when we understand it. But I'd just say there's a lot of uncertainty. It's a ways out; there's going to be comment periods. And so there's nothing going to be premature about what we do.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Look, I think you described here the rightsizing with investment equity debt CIE, the consumer and with head count is what were any [indiscernible] and where are you on the rightsizing of headcount? And the big picture question for David is simply, is this as bad as it gets? Do you feel comfortable that you captured everything with any severance to marches to GreenSky to CIE with debt investment -- debt equity investment and that you were conservative enough? Are we going to keep seeing 9% ROEs or does this accelerate your journey to that 15% midterm ROE?\nDenis Coleman: Okay. Mike, it's Dennis. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to David. So we called out our severance expense year-to-date was $260 million the vast majority of that was in the first quarter in connection with much, much larger levels of headcount reductions then. The reason that we're making an effort to call it out, you will also notice that our comp ratio net of business at 34%. We're just making an effort to provide transparency in terms of what components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance. And we think that's important because with the balance -- we're going to be focused on our pay-for-performance Ethos as well as balancing returns for shareholders but making sure that we have the capacity this year to protect our talent, protect the franchise, make sure we're positioned to capture the upside. So, the severance disclosures are just designed to help understand the financial impact of the actions we've taken David will give you more color but we've largely done what we set out to do. We're on target for the payroll efficiencies and that I'll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and expense.\nDavid Solomon: And Mike, to your bigger question, this was a meaningful quarter of putting some things that we strategically decided to do behind us. With respect to the balance sheet, I think one of the things that's very important to call out, this is an environment at the moment that's been hard on that legacy balance sheet. We are reducing the legacy balance sheet but we could just as well next quarter, if the environment improves, of positive revenues from that legacy balance sheet too. But if the environment got worse, we still have balance sheet to reduce. So I've been around the firm a long time. This was obviously a tough quarter but we also had one-off items that we put in. We're going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and we're going to continue to move forward. I think the environment feels better, if the environment feels better and the environment turns out to be better, you'll see better performance. But I feel very, very good about the strategic decisions that we're making, the execution that we're working on, the progress we're making in asset and wealth management and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment.\nMike Mayo: And can you remind us -- so you're taking this pain the charges and you're looking to get to mid-teens ROE in the medium term. How do you define medium term? And what should we be looking at along the way because to the extent that this accelerates this transition. It'd be nice to see some metrics externally for that progress?\nDavid Solomon: Well, we're going to make progress, Mike, over the next couple of years, the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make meaningful progress. But I'd just highlight, when you go back to our core business, banking and markets, where we are a leader and I think given the mix of that business is performing well and what's not a perfect environment for that business, if that business, we really believe will deliver mid-teens through the cycle. The investment banking returns right now are at a very, very significant low but we do have a 14% ROE to date in Global Banking and Markets. So an improved environment should help us. The asset management journey is going to take and we were very clear about this in February, it's going to take 2 to 3 more years for us to continue to make progress on the journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift. And we're working on it. We see a clear line of sight and we're going to make progress.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: You spoke earlier to green shoots that you're seeing in the banking side given how important sponsors are to your banking franchise, curious to drill down and specifically understand what you're seeing with that cohort and whether or not we need to see the levered loan market recover before they can come back in full force?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So thanks for that question, Brennan. It's a good question. It's an important thing. I'm glad you're asking us to highlight it because I think about it this way and it's very, very important. When you look at our M&A business, a significant contributor to our M&A business is M&A responses and that's come to a halt. It's come to a halt. There are 2 aspects of it. There's buy side and the sell side. The buy side obviously also give us financing and other capital markets activity. The sell side sometimes gives staple and financing opportunity, too but that stuff has kind of come to a hall. Here's one thing I know about financial sponsors. Number one, they own a bunch of assets. They're all for sale and they all will be sold. This environment has slowed down the pace of sale in a better environment that will accelerate. And I think we're going to see that accelerate as we look forward from here. This has been a particularly slow environment for that. Secondly, they have enormous dry powder, okay? And they can't make money unless they deploy. And so as soon as you get to a place, the values reset and financing costs are understood, you start to see people deploy. We're starting to see some of that. You saw this quarter, obviously, a very, very big transaction around FIS. And so you're going, I think [indiscernible] as we move forward. So this is a very, very important part of the investment banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown given the volatility of change in the environment. And I'm not smart enough to tell you this quarter, next quarter but it will meaningfully improve and it's an important component to investment banking activity. And it's one of the reasons why investment in banking activity is running at kind of from an activity level, kind of 10-year lows. And the other part of your question, Brennan, speaks to availability and health of financing markets. I think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions. We believe we can distribute risk into the market. There's also a number of principal in buckets, both with our clients and within our own funds that are capable of deploying financing to support transaction activity in this environment that could also be an attractive source of activity for the firm.\nBrennan Hawken: Great, I appreciate it. And then for my second, you started the process of selling GreenSky. We saw the goodwill impairment. What's been the reception to that asset? And has that impacted your expectation for how quickly you could finalize that sale?\nDenis Coleman: Brennan, in terms of the process, we're obviously in the middle of the process. We have feedback. I think extra color, just to share with you in terms of how you think about potential on the forward. It's a business we bought for $1.7 billion. We integrated into Goldman Sachs. We're seeing it perform well. It's a good business. We had made the decision to explore alternatives because it's not the right fit necessarily for Goldman Sachs. We've written down the goodwill in the Consumer platform segment. There's no more goodwill to be written down. That business at this point has remaining unamortized intangibles approximately $625 million that we consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and we'll do so in the future. And should we move forward with the transaction with respect to GreenSky, it could happen in a number of different ways. We could sell the platform, we could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on balance sheet. And should we choose to sell the loan book, we'll designate that as held for sale, much like the Marcus loans process and you'll see the P&L impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the associated reserve. So those are the types of things that could occur on the forward given the strategic activity but I don't think there's anything else to say about the GreenSky process given where we are.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: In markets we hit on financing. So I just want to look at intermediation here. And obviously, results were off quite a bit from a great quarter last year. But based on the results, it also looks like you did better than the implication on the conference circuit late in the quarter. So just the implication there would be that June got a lot better for intermediation. So I just want to make sure kind of that read is correct. And then did June feel like a more normal month relative to the first couple? And has that continued? Just trying to think about the quarter and the cadence there?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So thanks, Kevin. I'd just say and you highlighted this appropriately, just pointing back. I mean, one of the big differences when you look at the year-over-year comparison is we're coming out of the period where the word started in Russia and there was an enormous activity in the commodity space. And we were very, very well positioned to serve clients in that space. And so we -- if you go back and you look at the second quarter 2022, we way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity and obviously didn't have that here. I think to the second part of your comment, yes, June was better. June was definitely better. And so there was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in risk on and what we're early in the quarter. But there's no question, there's more of a risk on sentiment in the month of July than it was earlier in the second quarter. And you just think about it, we're coming out of March, we were coming out of the banking crisis and you think about when we were on this call in early April, we're in a very different place in terms of investor sentiment overall. So there has been an improvement through the quarter. And I think it's noted appropriately.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, that's great. And then just on transaction banking and the momentum there, be great to just get an update on some of the kind of the drivers. And really, the question is, it's such a huge market as you guys identified when you got the business. It's still a very small driver for Goldman. And so just trying to think about the growth there? And are there opportunities for more step function growth if you add a certain capability? Or just how should we think about the opportunity to really -- this to become a much bigger business for Goldman?\nDavid Solomon: So I appreciate that question. I think it's -- I think you're right. I think we've got an interesting platform. It's been very constructive in bringing deposits to Goldman Sachs. But one of the things that we said over the last couple of quarters is we're working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments activity into the flow, so this delivers real revenue and real value over time, that's taking some time and it will take some time. I think it's a dispersed business where there are lots of providers for most people. These are our clients, so we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged for this. They like our technology but making changes in payment flows takes time. So I think the team here is very focused on the long-term investment in building those relationships. I think a particular opportunity for us is around what I call kind of financial sponsor companies, etcetera. We're obviously given our financial sponsors franchise. We have a very, very good opportunity set over time. But this is going to take time to execute. I think it's one of those things where we have a business that's performing fine but it's not making a meaningful contribution. But I think this is something where, over time, we'll work hard to figure out how this can make a more meaningful contribution to the firm with our client base.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: I wanted to ask about private banking and lending, even ex the $100 million gain this quarter. That continues to be an area of growth. Can you talk about the prospects as we think about going forward and the inputs to kind of continue the lower growth you've seen?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So it's highlighted as one of those areas within the overall Asset & Wealth Management business which we think has the combined benefit of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues, there's a couple of components inside of that line item. We've obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform which has been contributing nicely and that was the area in which we had our Marcus loans activities which on the for those will obviously have -- will not be contributing on the forward. But the other piece of it which is an area of strategic priority for us is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities. And we have, as I think David highlighted earlier, premium ultra-high net worth business that has been growing nicely. But we feel like we're relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with those clients and across the wealth space. And so we have some new leadership across the division in the past number of quarters and a very, very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible and we expect that will be a contributor to that line item as well on the forward.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. And then just as a follow-up, in terms of the balance sheet reduction outlook and as you think about line of sight which I think you used to give us some numbers and given capital markets may be opening up and a little bit more receptive to exit anything that you could point to or numerically talk about in the short term that you're planning on or have as I said, line of sight on?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I appreciate that question. So obviously, we took you to current on historical principal investments at 23.8%. You know that there is a year-end '24 target of below $15 billion. We said we are well on pace towards that target. I would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions. We have a large number of processes and positions that we're exploring for disposition. They're all in various stages of completeness from exclusivity to on offer to being marketed to being prepared. We've moved a large number of positions year-to-date and we have more that we're focused on moving from here. So I would offer that up as it's an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: So the SCB obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now. We are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that. And specifically with the sale of the Marcus loans and potentially sale of GreenSky loans and again, according to the media, potentially exit the credit card. I guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the SCB? Or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual FACA.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So look, you're familiar with the process as we are. There's various levels of transparency that you get through the process. Obviously, those contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the test. But the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our SCB towards the 5% area that we've been discussing is really attributable to the on-balance sheet investments. We think that has a very, very meaningful impact for us. And the thing I would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this year's test with this SCB of 5.5% due to be implemented in October, that's based on the snapshot of activity that the Fed took last year which means that all the activities that we're discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test. And assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year which I don't know. But if it is, we will continue to see benefit from our reduction of these on balance sheet investments. So the reason why we remain so focused on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really believe that, that's a very, very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until, obviously, any new news on that front.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. So focus much more on the legacy on balance sheet positions versus the consumer lending portfolios?\nDavid Solomon: Yes.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: David, in your opening comments, you were talking about you guys are still very focused on reaching a mid-teens ROE through the cycle. We all know the business has been depressed as you pointed out in your comments. Can you share with us, if you go -- we have -- the public has access to the geologic data your data is probably better than that. But if you look at the geologic data for '21 and '22, obviously, global investment banking revenues were unusually strong. Why would you think is a normal level for global investment banking revenues that you need to get to that mid-teens ROE that you're targeting?\nDavid Solomon: So again, I'd highlight that Global Banking and Markets, even in this environment, has close to 14% ROE for the first 6 months of the year in what's not a great environment for investment banking. We don't disclose the separate ROE for investment banking but I just highlight to you, it's running way, way below what it's run on average over the course of the last 5 in the last 10 years. We do not have to go back to 2021 kind of levels in order to see a material uplift in that investment banking ROE which would bolster the overall through-the-cycle uplift of our Global Banking and Markets franchise. I'm sure in my lifetime, maybe not my career, I'll see another year like 2021 but 2021 falls into that category of years that come along once in a decade, I wouldn't call that normal either. But I would say that this is not normal and normalize somewhere in between. Our average, I hate the word normal, average lies somewhere in between.\nDenis Coleman: The only thing I would add which I'm sure is intuited to, Gerard, some of the activities that are not contributing us substantially right now are very capital-efficient activities. And so looking at deal logic levels of activity or revenues are 1 metric but some of them are very, very beneficial to our overall results. And they also have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence. So in environments of more active levels of investment banking, we see some positive impact across the rest of the firm that's not necessarily captured simply from the Delta explained in that investment banking line.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. One other thing, Gerard, I'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. If you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. There's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. You can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. You can see that from 2001 to 2002. You can see that from 2007 to 2008. You can see that in 2010 to 2011. And obviously, you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. What's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy, etcetera, I don't think it's going to be different this time. I think this is a cycle. We haven't seen a cycle in a while. And the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity, IPOs, equity financing, destiny, that's a fundamental part of our economy. It's not going away. It's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters.\nGerard Cassidy: Very helpful. And then Dennis, a technical question for you on GreenSky. You mentioned that you still have intangibles and you are going to think -- or you still have a determination to make whether GreenSky should move into held for sale. Two-part question. What will trigger that to move it into held for sale? Then should you do that? And if there's an intangible impairment, do you have to take that impairment at that time when you move it into held for sale or you can wait for a later date?\nDavid Solomon: So, thank you. The decision as to whether and when we move it to held for sale is when we make a decision affirmatively that we are selling the business and we're selling the loan portfolio and we will. When we make that decision, we will designate it as such and you will see the P&L consequences of that designation at that point in time. We evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment. And in the next quarter, we will also analyze the intangibles for impairment.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities.\nJames Mitchell: Just on Platform Solutions profitability. I appreciate you getting to an efficiency ratio already below 100%. But the other drag on profits is credit. I think you guys noted that in consumer platforms had a 5.8% net charge-off ratio. I would imagine point of sale is lower than cards. So that would imply cards as well north of 6% in terms of that charge-off ratio. How do we -- is that right? And how do we think about the credit quality in that book and where you see it kind of normalizing? SP1 Sure. So a couple of things. On the one hand, the net charge-off in consumer at 5 for the quarter, given the nature of our portfolio, its maturity, the overall operating environment we do expect that, that will continue to tick up over the next couple of quarters.\nCarey Halio: But you'll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well. And that's because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected. We had put together provisions on a conservative basis. And now as we have more and more data coming through, we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage ratio. So I'd say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated.\nJames Mitchell: Okay. Maybe just a follow-up question on Wealth Management. I haven't really talked about it in a while but whether it's with AECO and trying to move a little bit down market from the ultra-high net port space. Can you talk to the progress you've made there? And what kind of where you're seeing investments in growth?\nDavid Solomon: So AECO, within the overall platform, ACO is something we continue to grow. We continue to be focused on. It's extremely well received, in particular, by a number of our C-suite clients. It's part of our approach to having a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment. We do see opportunities to continue to expand our offering. We also see opportunities to expand within the ultra-high net worth space, both in the United States and abroad and we have a very, very long track record of delivering and we believe we are actually despite the franchise under-penetrated and continue to grow that as well.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. Please continue with any closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: Yes. We just want to thank you for joining. And obviously, if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me or Johan and the rest of the team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you, everybody.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you, Carey and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This quarter, we produced net revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%. Our results were impacted by several items related to businesses we are executing on a strategic transition and positioning the firm for the future. In particular, shifting our asset wealth management business to a less capital-intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition. All in, these items reduced our EPS for the second quarter by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Our results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular, headwinds facing our specific mix of businesses. Activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows and clients largely maintained a risk-off posture over the course of the quarter. CEOs around the world continue to be cautious as businesses grapple with persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions and slower growth. But we know the corporate activity and capital formation are core to our financial system and there are a number of structural catalysts that should lead to increased levels of activity. And we're seeing it begin to pick up in a few spots already, particularly equity capital markets and M&A dialogue. There's no question, recent economic data in the U.S. indicates the Fed's efforts to fight inflation are showing progress and we are starting to see more optimism about the forward trajectory. However, the year unfolds, we stand ready to help our clients navigate the evolving backdrop while maintaining a prudent risk posture and operating the firm more efficiently. Importantly, we laid out a clear set of strategic goals at our Investor Day in February and we are in execution mode. We have 2 incredibly strong client franchises a world-class global banking and markets business, we continue to deliver solid returns even in an environment with reduced activity levels and a scaled asset and wealth management platform that continues to show very strong underlying trends aligned with our Investor Day goals with growth and more recurring revenues of management and other fees and private banking and lending. These businesses are supported by a number of things. First, a long track record of serving the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals, building relationships as a trusted adviser is core to what Goldman Sachs does. Next, the client-centric mindset. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our efforts to bring to bear the best of the firm's capabilities and holistically serve clients with our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. Client feedback continues to be highly encouraging and we see opportunities to make further gains. We also have a global, broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions a key differentiator of value to our clients around the world. We have exceptional people. They are differentiated and they work hard to make a difference for our clients. And lastly, this is all underpinned by a culture of collaboration and excellence. We are also pleased that our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business and multiyear progress, deploy our capital. We continue to execute on the $30 billion share repurchase program we announced in February and we recently announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend. We have made it a priority to grow our dividend to a competitive rate. And since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our dividend from $0.80 to $2.75 per share per quarter. Given our ongoing strategic efforts to lower the firm's capital density and reduce earnings volatility, we are well positioned to grow it further. As I said, we are laser focused on executing on our strategy. This moment in the economic cycle creates meaningful headwinds for Goldman Sachs and our business mix. At the same time, we are making tough decisions that are driving the strategic evolution of the firm. Given both these factors, that should come as no surprise that we're going to a period of lower results. I remain fully confident that we will deliver on our through-the-cycle targets of mid-teens returns on at significant value for shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Yes. I just -- Glenn, I just want to add 2 things, just looking at that because Denise focused on the AE and the continued journey. The one thing you didn't touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there were meaningful marks around that, there are some where you're reduce where -- it might be a public physician. So we mark those public positions that market that night and you sell that position at a discount. So there could be a slight loss. There are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to what you believe it's worth as you sell and you get a gain. But I wouldn't say there's anything material that I'd call out in the context of that process. But the important thing about the journey that I'd like to emphasize is we laid out clear in Investor Day that we were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these 2 big businesses. Clearly, at this point in time, given the lack of investment banking activity, our investment banking business is performing at a lower level of return and a lower level of activity than we've seen in nearly a decade. We don't believe that's constant. We believe that, that global markets and banking business can deliver mid-teens returns through the cycle and that obviously makes up more than 2/3 of the firm. In addition, Mark Nachmann laid out at our Investor Day, a very clear path on asset management to grow the top line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high single-digit percentage and we set a target to drive the margin which ex the legacy balance sheet up to 25%. At that point, that is a mid-teens return business. And as we continue to narrow the drag which we're making progress on in the platforms and I believe we'll narrow that to 0 and move past that, you've got these 2 businesses that are the firm that will be mid-teens through the cycle. So that's the way I'd think about it. But obviously, you need a better environment in this environment to see that. Sure. I'd say on the following. It definitely feels better over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks than it felt earlier in the year. And I've talked in the past on this call and other times when I've talked to many of you about the fact that when you have a big reset, it takes 5 or 6 quarters to get that reset. It's not surprising that we're kind of at 6 quarters now and you're starting to see more activity. So it's definitely been a pickup in equity capital markets activity. That definitely feels better. There's more M&A dialogue I can't tell you exactly what the journey is. But when I go back and I look historically at other periods where the macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity, they tend to last for a year or so and then they start to improve. And so I think we're starting to see that here. It definitely feels better. I think the inflation data has been better. The client sentiment is better and now we'll have to watch and see that journey. But I know this activity level of 10-year loans and investment banking activity is not going to be the normal on a forward basis. Yes. So I think we've made -- I'll make a couple of comments and Dennis will probably add on with some more granular detail. But I think we've made progress. We set out some targets at the beginning of the year. As you heard in Dennis' prepared remarks, we have them basically accomplished in line of sight for more. You've seen our noncomp expense ex these extraordinary items around impairments have been down for the second quarter in a row. We've been very focused on that. And there's been real work done there because there's certainly inflationary pressure on a bunch of the line items that are noncomp expenses. I think that with hindsight, I'm very glad that we were early in January is starting to work on the headcount sizing. We took a couple of actions so far this year and we feel good about where we are. I'd remind everybody. And we've said this before that we are resuming our regular performance-based process that we do with compensation at the end of the year which we had stopped during the pandemic and started again next year when we go through compensation, we will do a performance review but we have no other specific plans on the headcount now. We'll watch the trajectory of revenues in the environment as we go forward. We'll always make adjustments if something changes. But as we just said, we think we're operating an extraordinarily low activities of investment banking. We're not going to erode that franchise. That is a key franchise of the firm. So this is a moment that we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover. We obviously are focused on a bunch of efficiency uplift in processes and operations. We have a big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology and we feel good about that. So we think that over time, that's or early '24 thing but we think over time, that's something else that will benefit the trajectory. Dennis, do you have some specific extent? Yes. So thanks for the question. And I frame it this way. As I think you know, we made difficult but appropriate decision over a year ago, working with our Board to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out the fall, the direction of travel and have been executing on that. And that included the wind down and the execution of the markets the wind down of the execution of the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio which has now been completed and obviously exploring options for GreenSky which we've been transparent on are in the process of. We've also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are long-term partnerships. We don't have unilateral rights with them. They definitely can operate better. We've been working hard to improve the operation of them which will reduce the drag and we're making good progress on that. And we're working with Apple and also with GM to do that. And so there's a significant focus on reducing that drag. And the drag of those credit card partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into 2024. We continue to have a very strong deposit platform. We launched an Apple savings platform which also was a successful launch to grow our deposit base. And so we'll continue to grow deposits and that's the course that we're on at the moment. So I'm going to start with a high-level just strategic view of what I think we've done and we're focused on doing and then Dennis will give you a little bit more detail. But 1 of the things -- this has been a strategic priority for us because I certainly remember going back over the last decade, there were times where we did not have the largest equity business and we were not in a position with our clients and the equity franchise that we're in now. And there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time. But we've been very focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress and growing the financing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a real difference. And so, I look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it; very good about what the team has accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients. Now broadly, that financing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue but it obviously is affected by risk on, risk off and overall market level activities. And so there can be variability in it but there's a base stability there that's much more meaningful than intermediation revenues. Dennis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that from a risk and a capital perspective. Yes, Betsy. So look, I appreciate that. I think there's a lot that's unknown about the direction of travel on this. And we're talking about years out. And so I think Dennis' message on early was in the context of the phase-in period, making sure we were getting there on time. But no, we are focused on deploying -- we generate a lot of capital because the firm generally through the cycle generates good earnings. We are going to return a bunch of that to shareholders and there are opportunities as we're talking about to deploy that in service of plants. Given the work we've done strategically, we now have much greater flexibility which gives us the option to look sharply as some of the deployment opportunities where maybe 6 to 12 months ago, we felt we needed to be more cautious. And at the same point, we have more capacity, as Dennis said, to step up buybacks. You should view that we're very, very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders and we'll be very thoughtful about the adjustment phase in of whatever comes when we understand it. But I'd just say there's a lot of uncertainty. It's a ways out; there's going to be comment periods. And so there's nothing going to be premature about what we do. And Mike, to your bigger question, this was a meaningful quarter of putting some things that we strategically decided to do behind us. With respect to the balance sheet, I think one of the things that's very important to call out, this is an environment at the moment that's been hard on that legacy balance sheet. We are reducing the legacy balance sheet but we could just as well next quarter, if the environment improves, of positive revenues from that legacy balance sheet too. But if the environment got worse, we still have balance sheet to reduce. So I've been around the firm a long time. This was obviously a tough quarter but we also had one-off items that we put in. We're going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and we're going to continue to move forward. I think the environment feels better, if the environment feels better and the environment turns out to be better, you'll see better performance. But I feel very, very good about the strategic decisions that we're making, the execution that we're working on, the progress we're making in asset and wealth management and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment. Well, we're going to make progress, Mike, over the next couple of years, the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make meaningful progress. But I'd just highlight, when you go back to our core business, banking and markets, where we are a leader and I think given the mix of that business is performing well and what's not a perfect environment for that business, if that business, we really believe will deliver mid-teens through the cycle. The investment banking returns right now are at a very, very significant low but we do have a 14% ROE to date in Global Banking and Markets. So an improved environment should help us. The asset management journey is going to take and we were very clear about this in February, it's going to take 2 to 3 more years for us to continue to make progress on the journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift. And we're working on it. We see a clear line of sight and we're going to make progress. Yes. So thanks for that question, Brennan. It's a good question. It's an important thing. I'm glad you're asking us to highlight it because I think about it this way and it's very, very important. When you look at our M&A business, a significant contributor to our M&A business is M&A responses and that's come to a halt. It's come to a halt. There are 2 aspects of it. There's buy side and the sell side. The buy side obviously also give us financing and other capital markets activity. The sell side sometimes gives staple and financing opportunity, too but that stuff has kind of come to a hall. Here's one thing I know about financial sponsors. Number one, they own a bunch of assets. They're all for sale and they all will be sold. This environment has slowed down the pace of sale in a better environment that will accelerate. And I think we're going to see that accelerate as we look forward from here. This has been a particularly slow environment for that. Secondly, they have enormous dry powder, okay? And they can't make money unless they deploy. And so as soon as you get to a place, the values reset and financing costs are understood, you start to see people deploy. We're starting to see some of that. You saw this quarter, obviously, a very, very big transaction around FIS. And so you're going, I think [indiscernible] as we move forward. So this is a very, very important part of the investment banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown given the volatility of change in the environment. And I'm not smart enough to tell you this quarter, next quarter but it will meaningfully improve and it's an important component to investment banking activity. And it's one of the reasons why investment in banking activity is running at kind of from an activity level, kind of 10-year lows. And the other part of your question, Brennan, speaks to availability and health of financing markets. I think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions. We believe we can distribute risk into the market. There's also a number of principal in buckets, both with our clients and within our own funds that are capable of deploying financing to support transaction activity in this environment that could also be an attractive source of activity for the firm. Yes. So thanks, Kevin. I'd just say and you highlighted this appropriately, just pointing back. I mean, one of the big differences when you look at the year-over-year comparison is we're coming out of the period where the word started in Russia and there was an enormous activity in the commodity space. And we were very, very well positioned to serve clients in that space. And so we -- if you go back and you look at the second quarter 2022, we way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity and obviously didn't have that here. I think to the second part of your comment, yes, June was better. June was definitely better. And so there was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in risk on and what we're early in the quarter. But there's no question, there's more of a risk on sentiment in the month of July than it was earlier in the second quarter. And you just think about it, we're coming out of March, we were coming out of the banking crisis and you think about when we were on this call in early April, we're in a very different place in terms of investor sentiment overall. So there has been an improvement through the quarter. And I think it's noted appropriately. So I appreciate that question. I think it's -- I think you're right. I think we've got an interesting platform. It's been very constructive in bringing deposits to Goldman Sachs. But one of the things that we said over the last couple of quarters is we're working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments activity into the flow, so this delivers real revenue and real value over time, that's taking some time and it will take some time. I think it's a dispersed business where there are lots of providers for most people. These are our clients, so we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged for this. They like our technology but making changes in payment flows takes time. So I think the team here is very focused on the long-term investment in building those relationships. I think a particular opportunity for us is around what I call kind of financial sponsor companies, etcetera. We're obviously given our financial sponsors franchise. We have a very, very good opportunity set over time. But this is going to take time to execute. I think it's one of those things where we have a business that's performing fine but it's not making a meaningful contribution. But I think this is something where, over time, we'll work hard to figure out how this can make a more meaningful contribution to the firm with our client base. Sure. So it's highlighted as one of those areas within the overall Asset & Wealth Management business which we think has the combined benefit of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues, there's a couple of components inside of that line item. We've obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform which has been contributing nicely and that was the area in which we had our Marcus loans activities which on the for those will obviously have -- will not be contributing on the forward. But the other piece of it which is an area of strategic priority for us is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities. And we have, as I think David highlighted earlier, premium ultra-high net worth business that has been growing nicely. But we feel like we're relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with those clients and across the wealth space. And so we have some new leadership across the division in the past number of quarters and a very, very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible and we expect that will be a contributor to that line item as well on the forward. Sure. I appreciate that question. So obviously, we took you to current on historical principal investments at 23.8%. You know that there is a year-end '24 target of below $15 billion. We said we are well on pace towards that target. I would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions. We have a large number of processes and positions that we're exploring for disposition. They're all in various stages of completeness from exclusivity to on offer to being marketed to being prepared. We've moved a large number of positions year-to-date and we have more that we're focused on moving from here. So I would offer that up as it's an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress. Sure. So look, you're familiar with the process as we are. There's various levels of transparency that you get through the process. Obviously, those contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the test. But the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our SCB towards the 5% area that we've been discussing is really attributable to the on-balance sheet investments. We think that has a very, very meaningful impact for us. And the thing I would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this year's test with this SCB of 5.5% due to be implemented in October, that's based on the snapshot of activity that the Fed took last year which means that all the activities that we're discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test. And assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year which I don't know. But if it is, we will continue to see benefit from our reduction of these on balance sheet investments. So the reason why we remain so focused on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really believe that, that's a very, very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until, obviously, any new news on that front. Yes. So again, I'd highlight that Global Banking and Markets, even in this environment, has close to 14% ROE for the first 6 months of the year in what's not a great environment for investment banking. We don't disclose the separate ROE for investment banking but I just highlight to you, it's running way, way below what it's run on average over the course of the last 5 in the last 10 years. We do not have to go back to 2021 kind of levels in order to see a material uplift in that investment banking ROE which would bolster the overall through-the-cycle uplift of our Global Banking and Markets franchise. I'm sure in my lifetime, maybe not my career, I'll see another year like 2021 but 2021 falls into that category of years that come along once in a decade, I wouldn't call that normal either. But I would say that this is not normal and normalize somewhere in between. Our average, I hate the word normal, average lies somewhere in between. Yes. One other thing, Gerard, I'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. If you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. There's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. You can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. You can see that from 2001 to 2002. You can see that from 2007 to 2008. You can see that in 2010 to 2011. And obviously, you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. What's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy, etcetera, I don't think it's going to be different this time. I think this is a cycle. We haven't seen a cycle in a while. And the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity, IPOs, equity financing, destiny, that's a fundamental part of our economy. It's not going away. It's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters. So, thank you. The decision as to whether and when we move it to held for sale is when we make a decision affirmatively that we are selling the business and we're selling the loan portfolio and we will. When we make that decision, we will designate it as such and you will see the P&L consequences of that designation at that point in time. We evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment. And in the next quarter, we will also analyze the intangibles for impairment. So AECO, within the overall platform, ACO is something we continue to grow. We continue to be focused on. It's extremely well received, in particular, by a number of our C-suite clients. It's part of our approach to having a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment. We do see opportunities to continue to expand our offering. We also see opportunities to expand within the ultra-high net worth space, both in the United States and abroad and we have a very, very long track record of delivering and we believe we are actually despite the franchise under-penetrated and continue to grow that as well."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $10.9 million [ph] and net earnings of $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.08. As David mentioned, we have provided additional detail this quarter on 3 items that impacted our results. These items are a gain in connection with our sale process for the market's unsecured loan portfolio as well as the business' operating results. Losses from our historical principal investments within Asset and Wealth Management and results related to GreenSky, including a goodwill impairment in consumer platforms. In aggregate, for the second quarter, these 3 items impacted net earnings by $1.4 billion and reduced our EPS by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 4; Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $7.2 billion in the second quarter. Advisory revenues of $645 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid significantly lower industry completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $338 million as we saw some signs of reopening in the capital markets, although volumes continue to remain well below medium and long-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues were slightly down versus the second quarter of 2022 as activity remains muted. Nonetheless, our client franchise remains very strong and we remain well positioned to support the needs of our clients. We ranked number one in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and high-yield debt on a year-to-date basis. Additionally, our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter, primarily in advisory. Fixed net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter as clients remained in a risk-off posture, relative to an active prior year quarter, particularly in commodities, rates and currencies. Fixed financing revenues were $622 million. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-on-year. Equities financing revenues were a record $1.4 billion as we benefited from our ongoing strategic focus and increased balances. This was largely offset by a decline in intermediation revenues, primarily in derivatives. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both second equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base and we continue to see attractive deployment opportunities to support further growth. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5; revenues of $3 billion were down 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by weaker results in equity and debt investments. Management and other fees increased 5% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher assets under supervision. Private Banking and lending revenues were also a record at $874 million. We continue to see positive momentum in this business as we benefit from higher deposit balances and NII. Results were supported by a gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of substantially all of the remaining Marcus loans portfolio. Equity investments generated losses of $403 million. More specifically, we had roughly $305 million of net losses in our private portfolio, primarily due to markdowns on investments in office-related commercial real estate and approximately $100 million of net losses in our public portfolio, largely driven by a loss related to a historical principal investment that we sold out of during the quarter. Importantly, we have now reduced the public portfolio to approximately $1 billion, down from more than $4.5 billion in 2021. Debt investments revenues were $197 million, with the year-over-year decline driven by weaker performance in real estate investments. This quarter, we also experienced approximately $485 million of impairments on our real estate-related CIE portfolio which are reflected in operating expenses. In aggregate, the results from Marcus loans and the losses from our historical principal investments negatively impacted our margins for the segment by approximately 15 percentage points for the first half of the year. Now moving to Page 6; total firm with assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $30 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows and representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning now to Page 7 on alternatives; alternative assets on supervision totaled $267 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $521 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $11 billion for the quarter and $25 billion for the first half of the year. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now over $200 billion and remains very well positioned to achieve our 2024 target of $225 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $53 billion, of which $24 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the second quarter, we reduced this portfolio by $3.6 billion which included sales of a number of CRE-related investments, bringing year-to-date reductions to approximately $6 billion and putting us well on pace to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8; revenues were $659 million, driven by growth in loan balances and consumer platforms. As noted earlier, we took a $504 million impairment charge on the goodwill associated with consumer platforms this quarter in connection our exploration of a potential sale of the GreenSky business. We will continue to evaluate its intangibles for impairment and should we decide to sell the business, we will also make a determination regarding moving Greensky to held for sale, similar to the action we took last quarter with respect to our markets unsecured loan portfolio. We will share further updates as appropriate. Additionally, you'll recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year, we said that we expected to reduce the efficiency ratio in Platform Solutions below 100% by the end of this year and we are making progress. Absent the impact of the goodwill impairment in consumer platforms, the efficiency ratio for the segment year-to-date would have been better than our stated goal. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, unchanged versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $615 million. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to continued growth and higher net charge-offs in our lending portfolio within consumer platforms. Additionally, within our wholesale portfolio, impairments and a reserve build were partially offset by releases due to lower balances. Moving on to Page 10; we've added a new slide this quarter, providing additional detail on our CRE exposure. Starting with the left side of the page, CRE loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book, roughly 15%. And we are well diversified by property type with only 1% in the office category. Moving to the right side of the page, you can see additional detail on our CRE-related on-balance sheet alternative investments. We conducted a comprehensive asset-by-asset review of this portfolio this quarter and we have incorporated the feedback from our sell-down process. Office-related exposure represents approximately 2% of the aggregate portfolio and equity securities loans and debt securities and approximately 15% of the CIE investments in other category net of financings. Overall, the CRE investments are diversified across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Furthermore, 50% of these investments are historical principal investments that we intend to exit over the medium term. We continue to remain highly focused on the overall risk management of this portfolio. Turning to expenses on Page 11; total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 34% which includes approximately $260 million of year-to-date state severance costs. At Investor Day in February, we articulated this year and we have now largely reached this organ with line of sight to surpass it. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion. The increase in our non-compensation expense was entirely driven by the CIE and goodwill impairments I discussed previously. Absent these items, non-comp expense is down for the second consecutive quarter, even in the face of inflationary headwinds. Our effective tax rate for the first half of '20 was an increase in taxes on non-U.S. earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of roughly 22%. Next, capital on Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach which is 190 basis points over our new 13% requirement that will become applicable in October. As David mentioned, we are pleased with the results of the recent stress test and remain confident that our strategy to reduce the capital density of our business will continue to help improve our SEB over time. The 80 basis point reduction in our SEB will allow us to continue to remain nimble in dynamically deploying capital to support our client franchise. In the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $750 million and common stock dividends of $864 million. Our Board has also approved a 10% increase in our dividend, to $2.75 per share beginning in the third quarter. This increase will enable us to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a competitive yield, complemented by our previously announced $30 million share repurchase program where we intend to step up the level of buybacks going forward. In conclusion, our second quarter results reflect a challenging backdrop as well as our ongoing execution of several strategic actions. These initiatives will help transition our business and improve our overall return profile. We remain confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. So Glenn, thank you for the question. And I think in terms of our journey towards our through-the-cycle returns, there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at Investor Day as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efficiency. The capital efficiency has been a project that we've been working on for a number of years. We've had particular increases in those reductions over both the first and second quarter. As you know, about HPI down $6 billion. And as we -- if we ultimately reach our target, we expect the total AE reduction to be approximately $9 billion. I mean just to add for you. So end of the second quarter, we ended -- headcount was 44,600 down about 2% on the quarter, about 8% year-to-date. I think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-year metric of down 5% because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter. But as David said, we're happy about taking the action early in the year, positioning the firm reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies. Sure. So you have pieces of the answer to my question to the question for my answer. So what we would say, obviously, very pleased with the CCAR results -- we have 190 basis points of cushion. We intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to continue to grow our activities there. We announced our increase in dividend. We've been very committed to sustainably growing our dividend and we're going to increase our level of buybacks. We are mindful of Basel III revisions but we also recognize that we will get a rule. There will be a comment period for the rule. There will be a period in which that's implemented, some suggestions in the beginning of 2026. That implementation may even have a phase-in period. So as we think about the way in which we manage capital we think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders. We obviously will make sure we're in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early -- but in the intervening period, we're going to continue to manage our capital to grow the firm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders and we thought we would indicate that, that intention is to step it up from where we are. Sure. So that is the strategic direction of travel. We are allocating a lot of time and resources, human capital, financial capital to grow those activities Equities financing revenues are nearly 50% of overall equities revenue this quarter and that's something that has been growing. Even the combined FIC and equities financing as a percentage of pick and equities continue to grow. So remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that space with clients. And we're also observing that there's a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period. It's paying dividends both across dividend and intermediation and recognizing David's comments with respect to market valuation levels which drive changes in balances and changes in behavior, there's also activities that we've been taking to sort of systematically identify components of the client base across the financing activities and make sure that we're capturing more share in underpenetrated portions of the client base. So remain committed to growing that activity. It's relatively more durable than intermediation but like other line items, it can fluctuate on the forward. Sure. So I'll comment both on FICC and equities. In fixed income, we had slightly softer performance over period-on-period. That was driven by a component of fixed financing which is more episodic which is commodities-based financing, those activity levels were a lot higher. And so I think you see lack of contribution from commodities-based financing activity that was in prior periods but I think the forward for other components of our fixed financing, like collateralized lending and repo, I think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to grow those types of activities. I'm always cautious about predicting growth off of record performance. We're pleased with the equities financing performance in the second quarter and we do intend to grow that from here but we'll have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of period-over-period growth but we do think there is still unaddressed market share and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues. Okay. Mike, it's Dennis. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to David. So we called out our severance expense year-to-date was $260 million the vast majority of that was in the first quarter in connection with much, much larger levels of headcount reductions then. The reason that we're making an effort to call it out, you will also notice that our comp ratio net of business at 34%. We're just making an effort to provide transparency in terms of what components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance. And we think that's important because with the balance -- we're going to be focused on our pay-for-performance Ethos as well as balancing returns for shareholders but making sure that we have the capacity this year to protect our talent, protect the franchise, make sure we're positioned to capture the upside. So, the severance disclosures are just designed to help understand the financial impact of the actions we've taken David will give you more color but we've largely done what we set out to do. We're on target for the payroll efficiencies and that I'll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and expense. Brennan, in terms of the process, we're obviously in the middle of the process. We have feedback. I think extra color, just to share with you in terms of how you think about potential on the forward. It's a business we bought for $1.7 billion. We integrated into Goldman Sachs. We're seeing it perform well. It's a good business. We had made the decision to explore alternatives because it's not the right fit necessarily for Goldman Sachs. We've written down the goodwill in the Consumer platform segment. There's no more goodwill to be written down. That business at this point has remaining unamortized intangibles approximately $625 million that we consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and we'll do so in the future. And should we move forward with the transaction with respect to GreenSky, it could happen in a number of different ways. We could sell the platform, we could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on balance sheet. And should we choose to sell the loan book, we'll designate that as held for sale, much like the Marcus loans process and you'll see the P&L impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the associated reserve. So those are the types of things that could occur on the forward given the strategic activity but I don't think there's anything else to say about the GreenSky process given where we are. The only thing I would add which I'm sure is intuited to, Gerard, some of the activities that are not contributing us substantially right now are very capital-efficient activities. And so looking at deal logic levels of activity or revenues are 1 metric but some of them are very, very beneficial to our overall results. And they also have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence. So in environments of more active levels of investment banking, we see some positive impact across the rest of the firm that's not necessarily captured simply from the Delta explained in that investment banking line."

I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, April 18, 2023. Thank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\nCarey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer, Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.\nDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment. We produced net revenues of $12.2 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.79 and an ROE of 11.6% and an ROTE of 12.6%. The first quarter was certainly volatile, particularly for the banking sector. After a fairly benign operating environment at the start of the year, in March, we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the United States. Stress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the financial sector where we saw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order. These stresses were not limited to the U.S., as we saw when regulators help arrange the combination of Switzerland's two largest financial institutions. It's important to appreciate the size of the disruption. Some of the market moves during the period were staggering, particularly in interest rates. To give you a sense of the magnitude, there have been just four days in the past 25 years that have seen two-year yields move by 50 basis points or more intraday. One was in September 2008 and three of them occurred in mid-March this year. Monday, March 13th was the biggest one-day move in the U.S. Treasury two-year yield in over 35 years. As we sit here today, it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us. Prompt action by regulators was vital in bolstering confidence and stabilizing market sentiment. The events of the first quarter acted as another real-life stress test and they demonstrated the resilience of the country's largest financial institutions. The G-SIBs have been a source of strength for the financial system. We joined a consortium with 10 other large institutions in making a $30 billion uninsured term deposit into First Republic Bank to send the strong vote of confidence in and commitment to the U.S. banking sector. As for Goldman Sachs, our long-standing and deeply rooted risk management culture helped us navigate this unusual environment. In our 154-year history, we have lived and managed through many periods of disruption, and it's our rigorous processes and planning for tailored scenarios before the stress that enable us to react quickly and effectively when they do occur. While it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't always execute perfectly, our risk management culture, strong liquidity, and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients. Given this backdrop, it was clear our clients needed help managing their risks and turn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities. Both FICC and Equities had a strong quarter, as we helped clients with their intermediation and financing needs. Underwriting activity, however, remained extremely muted and below recent averages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful way given the market disruption. All-in, Global Banking & Markets delivered industry-leading returns of 16.6%, in line with our through-the-cycle targets even while advisory and capital markets activity remained muted. This franchise continues to show impressive resilience in a variety of market environments, given our broad and diversified set of businesses. Management fees across Asset & Wealth Management grew sequentially, but segment returns were in the mid-single-digits as our on-balance sheet investments remained susceptible to volatility in asset prices. It is a strategic priority to continue to reduce these positions. And while we've made progress, there is still work to do. In Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards profitability. We also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer platform businesses. In the first quarter, we sold a portion of our Marcus loan portfolio and transferred the remainder to held-for-sale. While this activity is now reflected in our AWM segment, it is an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space. Denis will take you through the financial impact of that momentarily. Additionally, we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of GreenSky. We believe GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with first quarter originations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a weighted FICO on total originations of over 780. Given our current strategic priorities however, we may not be the best long-term holder of this business. We will update you on our progress if and when there are material developments. As I close, I'd like to say a few words about the forward outlook. The recent events in the banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a credit contraction given the environment is limiting banks' appetites to extend credit. This is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we're watching closely. Businesses and consumers continue to adjust to higher interest rates. While the forward trajectory is still unclear, we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and we are operating the firm such that we are well prepared in the event that the environment weakens further. Overall, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. As the events of the past quarter have illustrated, we are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around the world to continue serving the broad range of clients' needs with excellence. And while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of February, we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth Management business, and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.79. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.4 billion in the first quarter, which generated an industry-leading ROE for the segment of 16.6%. Advisory revenues of $818 million were down 27% amid lower industry completions. Underwriting revenues continued to be below recent averages and were lower year-over-year. Despite the difficult backdrop, we were number one in the league tables for completed M&A and high-yield debt underwriting. We also ranked second for equity and equity-related underwriting. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter, primarily in Advisory, but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the year and 2024, particularly for strategic M&A. We also expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen broadly, but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogs in the first two weeks of the second quarter. FICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter, down 17%, as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than offset by significantly lower currencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the first quarter of 2022. In FICC financing, revenues rose slightly year-over-year. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, down 7% year-on-year. A decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record financing revenues of $1.3 billion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances coupled with improved customer spreads. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion rose 24% year-over-year, given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as management and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. Though underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and lending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year, driven by the partial sale of our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions. The associated revenue reduction of $470 million was largely offset by a reserve release of $440 million. Additionally, we benefited from NII and incremental reserve releases associated with paydowns. All-in, the Marcus loan portfolio was profitable for the quarter. Net revenues for equity investments were $119 million, driven by $229 million in revenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public portfolio, partially offset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity portfolio, primarily within real estate. This quarter, we experienced approximately $355 million of impairments on our CIE portfolio, which are reflected in operating expenses. Debt investments revenues were $408 million, driven by net interest income of $363 million. Moving on to Page 6, total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49 billion of net inflows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide flows in the money market funds. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $494 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion, relatively solid given the current environment, and bringing total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day to $193 billion. While we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for the rest of 2023, we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain confident in achieving our 2024 target of $225 billion. On balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $57 billion, of which $27 billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments by $2.3 billion in the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density, including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by 2024 year-end. I'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues of $564 million more than doubled year-over-year, driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms. This week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Apple through this additional offering and to introduce another source of deposit funding for the firm. In transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus year-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter amid higher deposit costs. As we spoke about at our Investor Day in February, we're focused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service provider. In this regard, we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as our client count grew by approximately 20% in the first quarter. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income of $1.8 billion in the first quarter was down 14% relative to the fourth quarter, driven by increased funding costs supporting training activities within Global Banking & Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $171 million, including the previously mentioned reserve release associated with the Marcus unsecured lending portfolio and model updates, which were only partially offset by roughly $245 million in consumer net charge-offs. Spending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio, as of quarter-end, we had $29 billion of funded CRE loans. This portfolio is diversified by property type and includes $10 billion of exposure in the form of conservatively structured warehouse lending with typical LTVs of approximately 50%. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.4 billion. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter, but up versus last year. The majority of the year-over-year increase was driven by the aforementioned CIE impairments as well as expenses related to NNIP. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. For the full year, we expect a tax rate between 21% and 22%. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, 100 basis points above our current requirement and at the top end of our management buffer. In the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of over $2.5 billion and common stock dividends of roughly $870 million. While we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend, we would note that repurchases in any given quarter will vary. Though we find our stock price attractive at current levels in light of the current environment, we expect to moderate our repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. In conclusion, our first quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile environment. Our robust financial position allowed us to focus on serving our clients and helping them navigate this period of market disruption. Across our leading businesses in Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, we remain well positioned to continue to support our clients and execute on our strategic priorities. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi, there. Curious, you mentioned being optimistic about M&A in the back-half, particularly on the strategic side. I'm curious what and how you -- what you're seeing that gives you that confidence. Obviously it must be conversations. And then what about the sponsor community? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. And so appreciate the question, and you're right. It has to do with dialogs and things that we can see. I'd say as we came into the new year, there's no questions dialogs have picked up. There's no question -- and I always talk about this when we talk about it broadly, confidence affects the ability for people to move forward to be active in the M&A market and certainly what's gone on over the course of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogs. But when you think about big strategic activity, I think most big companies continue to operate from a position where they're trying to make sure they have the scale and the strength competitively to advance their strategies. And so those strategic dialogs are quite active. And if you actually look over the course of the last week or two, there have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that. We're seeing more dialogs like that and so we're hopeful that more of that will come to fruition. I just think that's a steady part of the diet. The companies need to continue to execute on to improve their strategic position. Now, with respect to financial sponsors, we're still going through a reset. I'm encouraged by the fact in the quarter, we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid offer between the value that a financial sponsor could achieve and the financing price came to a -- came to meet. There was a good data point and a sell-down of a legacy deal in the market, but I would say the financial sponsor activity is still muted and there is more upside as the reset on both value and financing cost continues. I think we're going to get there. I'd expect more in the second half of the year unless there was a really strong, a much more pronounced economic disruption because it just takes time for people to reset. We've now kind of gone through five quarters of reset. And so generally speaking, historically, you kind of see these things turn on after four to six quarters. So I would just expect more of a base level of activity from what's been very, very muted.\nGlenn Schorr: Appreciate that. And building on that, your comment about companies wanting to build on their strategic position, maybe we could talk a little bit about your transaction banking platform because it's still growing. I'm just curious on the March events that we saw, did it cause any rethinking or maybe encouragement in terms of the direction of what you're doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits? And did you notice any -- was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits acted during the March crisis? Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Glenn, it's Denis. Thanks for the question. I'd say that our conviction around the transaction banking business remains very, very strong. I think what we were able to observe in the first quarter, I highlighted in my script and it's something that we're focused on strategically, is, we grew the client count by about 20% in the quarter, which is a similar amount to all of last year. And we're very, very focused on continuing to improve our position with our clients, offer them more and more services and grow this business steadily over the long-term to create value. I think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the quarter, they were in line with our expectations, and as we indicated, they ended on a quarter-over-quarter basis up just about $1 billion.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, David, you referred to the hyper volatility in the rates market, but would appreciate if you can address just fixed-income trading, what happened there this quarter. Clearly there was some lagged performance versus peers. To the extent you can, just give us a flavor of what happened and your expectations around how things evolve from here, how are clients' macro funds holding up in face of this volatility.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So I appreciate the question. I mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just watching what I'd highlight is, I think we had a very solid quarter in FICC. We had nearly a $4 billion quarter. And just to put that in perspective, I think that's a top-decile quarter for that. I think we've had -- I think it was the eighth best quarter on record. I think we've got 96 quarters. So it was a solid performance and just the headline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid FICC quarter. It was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter, and I think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well. Now, some of the noise that I see just from the early morning release, our FICC business was down versus the first quarter of last year by 17%, but in the first quarter of last year, we had significant outperformance. If I remember correctly, our FICC revenues in the first quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the competitor average was kind of flat or down. And you can go look at that from a base perspective. We had much more significant outperformance in the first quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business. So if you remember back in the first quarter of 2022, the war with Ukraine started, there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities. And so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, I think FICC performance in the quarter was strong. We were there to serve our clients. And by any standards, it was a good quarter. I think given the environment that we're operating in, I would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients. It's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of movement and positioning, and so we're finding our clients active at the moment.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just separately, I guess, a big focus post Investor Day was picking up pace on asset sales. How does the environment over the last month influence that? Equity markets obviously held up pretty well ex the financials. So given the sense of just asset sale pace of that, how you're thinking about that and any change today versus Investor Day and how does that translate into pace of buybacks maybe in the back half of the year?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on the disposition of our historical principal investments, and we highlighted that we reduced them from just under $30 billion to just over $27 billion during the quarter. Then it's also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the $15 billion target number that we laid out over the course of the next 24 months. We feel good about that progress and we're going to continue to move to reduce that to zero over time. There are a lot of positions. There's no question when there are market headwinds, some of that might go a little bit slower, but we're on pace with what we're trying to do and are committed to it. And obviously, we see a big change in that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments out, the volatility in that business, we believe, will change meaningfully.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, David and Denis. Just to follow up on the question on the Markets business, March did feel like a very tough month for some of your institutional clients, particularly saw hedge fund closures, we are hearing of deleveraging. So how does that inform your view of the outlook for the trading businesses and your market share, particularly given, I guess, Goldman's exposure to the hedge fund community?\nDavid Solomon: So I appreciate that question. We're obviously very focused on share and our share gains. We do participate with the hedge fund community, but when you look at our big competitors, they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too. We also are very significant with the broad institutional community. As I said just in the previous question, our clients are active at the moment because there's a lot going on. We're very focused on our market share. As we said in our Investor Day, we laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can advance our position with the top 100 clients that we deal with in our markets business. We continue to be optimistic about our share position, our overall ability to serve our clients, and we do think in this environment, clients will continue to be active.\nChristian Bolu: Great. Thank you. And then maybe a question on capital return. Can you just clarify why you are slowing buybacks? Your capital ratio is seen very healthy to your point that the stock is attractive at this level. So not sure that I get it. And then any comments on your appetite for strategic acquisitions here? There's been a lot of stress in the wealth management space, which is a space I know you guys are interested in. So curious here, if you're conserving capital to go on the offense.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Christian, it's Denis. Thank you for the question around capital. And obviously, in this case, appreciating the starting point in Q1, where we significantly increased the amount of buyback activity in Q1. We remain very committed to return of capital to shareholders, committed to sustainably growing our dividend, committing to the overall capital return profile, but we're also observing opportunities to deploy into the franchise on behalf of clients. And there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment. And so our expectations is that buyback activity will be moderated, but we'll monitor that over the course of the quarter. As you say, we do like the stock price and remain committed to return of capital to shareholders.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: So I wanted to start off with a question on Platform Solutions. The business saw a step up in expense. I just wanted to understand how we should be thinking about the trajectory for expenses in the segment. And similarly, for provision going forward, just following this quarter's significant reserve release, we know you had accrued reserves pretty conservatively for that segment, but the top line momentum's good. It would just be helpful to get some perspective on how we should think about both the expense as well as the credit trajectory from here.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks. In terms of the overall trajectory for the segment, I think we have to step back. Our number one focus is driving towards profitability. We also mentioned that we look to continue to improve the efficiency ratio. That's certainly over the course of a period of time. Maybe not every given quarter, but we remain committed to what we outlined. As you say, we've seen good top line performance of the business. And on the reserve release, it was a function of owning our point-of-sale business for some period of time, been able to observe it, take in more data. And GreenSky is actually performing better than we had modeled. And so that was a contributor to the reserve release in the segment. As we think about it on a go-forward basis, it's obviously going to be a function of origination activities across the platform. We now have a reserve level of roughly 13% in the consumer space. So that can give you a sense of how to model provisions based on forward origination activity.\nSteven Chubak: That's great, Denis. And just for my follow-up on expense and maybe more like a ticky tack modeling question, the expenses were a bit higher than expectations, but I recall you noted at Investor Day the need to absorb some severance charges. You also had some pretty outsized impairments related to CIE portfolio. Was hoping you can maybe help us quantify the level of one-timers in the expense base this quarter just as we think about benchmarking versus some of your longer-term efficiency targets.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you. Thank you very much. So let me take that in pieces. In terms of -- on the compensation expense, any charges associated with severance and some of the actions that we took in the first quarter are included within our overall comp accrual, which is a 30% -- 33% of our revenues net of provisions. That's embedded inside of that number. In terms of the change in non-compensation expenses, they were flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but did include, as you know, $355 million of CIE impairments. And so we thought it was important to call that out. And that also explains a bunch of the year-over-year delta between Q1 '22 and Q1 '23. That together with full quarter impact of NNIP helps explain the delta in that line for the first quarter of this year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: So just a couple of quick questions here. One, on the consumer repositioning that you talked about today with the Marcus loan sales and with your comments around GreenSky, would you say that as those are done and dusted, that would be it for the consumer repositioning?\nDavid Solomon: I think, Betsy, what we said clearly is we're narrowing the focus. We continue to be focused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform. I do think there are opportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think about operating it, but we're going to continue to examine all the things that we can do to make that as successful as possible. As I just highlighted, we don't think we're necessarily the best owner of GreenSky. So we're taking action on that, and then we'll continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform -- the card platforms to profitability.\nBetsy Graseck: And so there's some nice capital release that comes from that. How should we anticipate you're going to be utilizing that as we look forward here?\nDenis Coleman: So as we see the capital release from some of those activities, that just gives us incremental flexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back in the franchise and/or returning that capital back to shareholders.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi, just a little bit more on the consumer repositioning strategy. How much in the Marcus loans, I think there were $4.5 billion at year-end, did you sell? And what do you intend to do with the rest?\nDenis Coleman: So we sold about $1 billion of the Marcus loans and the balance has been moved to held-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time.\nMike Mayo: And so the marks that you took on these loans, what -- on what -- how much of those marks were in the $4.5 billion? Was it only a subset or the entire portfolio?\nDenis Coleman: So we marked the entire -- we sold a portion of the portfolio, and then we marked the balance to market. And you'll see that reflected in the $470 million number moving through net revenues. And our reserve release was $440 million. If you think about the portfolio overall for the quarter, we generated incremental NII, and we had other net paydowns. So for the whole quarter, we generated revenues north of $150 million and it was profitable for the quarter. As we move forward into the second quarter, we'll continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the balance of those exposures.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to follow up first on a question that Glenn asked about the transactional banking. In the past, in conversations, I believe that you've indicated that a lot of the competitors are the regional banks there. So I want to confirm that that's the case. And then given some of the stress that we've seen and concerns around some of those providers, how are you adjusting your strategy in order to continue to build on the momentum that you seem to have shown here in the first quarter? And if we see that continued stress, would you pursue inorganic venues to add scale or capabilities?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. So appreciate the question, Brennan. The -- we think in transaction banking, we have a very good platform, a very good product. And the feedback that we're getting from clients about the product offering, how it works, what it allows corporate treasuries and CFOs to do is very positive. It's obviously attractive for us to take deposits, but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are operating on our platform. And so we're working hard to make sure, as we're adding clients, we're bringing the value that attaches the technology to what they're doing in a way that grows that platform. We are seeing positive results, but this takes time. These are long-cycle decisions. They're not day-to-day decisions on short-term trades. As Denis highlighted, we had good momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our platform. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. I do think, given the size and the strength of Goldman Sachs, as a G-SIB and the way we're positioned, we're well positioned to compete with our clients for this business, coupled with the fact that we have an excellent product offering. So we are going to stay focused on that and we expect the business to grow over time.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks for that color. Appreciate it. And then for my follow-up, you all just announced this morning the new deposit arrangement with Apple. And the yield on that is pretty close to Marcus, a little above. How should we think about the economics of that Apple relationship and the deposits specifically? And then how do you manage potential risk for cannibalization with your own Marcus offering? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: So thank you for the question. So obviously this is something that we launched yesterday that gives us another deposit channel. It's the opportunity for somebody that's a credit cardholder to put a deposit on. We've obviously looked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds -- who has a Marcus deposit and that overlap is small, but we'll obviously watch closely to see whether or not there is any cannibalization. But this is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and it's always good for us to broaden our deposit base. And so this is small at the moment and we'll watch it carefully, but I think it's an interesting opportunity for the firm.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good morning, David, Denis. I want to just touch on the equity financing strength in the quarter. I know you kind of highlighted spreads and customer activity, but also appreciate this is an area of focus for the firm bigger picture. So just love to think about kind of where we're jumping off of into the second quarter and whether the first quarter benefited from the market stress and that maybe you do syncretic things that happened during the quarter or if this is actually a reasonable kind of jumping off point, and just maybe a better outlook for that business for the rest of the year.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. I appreciate that question. I'll give you some context to help you understand sort of the sequential activity and the direction. So our overall balances were a lot lower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we reduced our footprint. And so as we came into the first quarter, we were able to re-expand the capacity, clients engaged with us. We saw an increase in balances, increase in client activities, increase in customer spreads. We've had in place for some time, a strategy to identify new types of clients that could come on to the platform and engage with us. And so I'd say that we're working sort of full speed ahead on that. We continue to be very, very focused on this as one of the key priorities within the Global Banking & Markets business.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Thanks, Denis. Just a bigger picture follow-up here. So it feels like Goldman generally takes market share during periods of stress. And so we just went through a pretty extreme period of stress in banking system and maybe we're getting on the other side of it, but perhaps not. And so with Credit Suisse now forcing an acquisition and capital likely becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly, are there new areas of maybe opportunity for Goldman to take market share just in terms of where you're going to lean in with your balance sheet as you've done in the past? How should we think about maybe a couple of the top areas where you feel like you can maybe incrementally take market share just as a result of what happened over the last month or so?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think our core banking and markets franchise is incredibly well positioned. You can see the performance this quarter. I certainly wouldn't call it a top quartile for investment banking, traditional capital markets, IPOs, M&A activity. But with a 16.7% ROE in our banking and markets segment, I think it's performing well. We have the breadth, the footprint, the global franchise, I think, to continue to strengthen our share. And as I commented a little bit earlier, we continue to be focused on looking at our performance on the top 100, now expand to the top 150 clients and making sure that we're moving up and capturing share and serving them well. I do think, given some of the things that have gone on, there are other opportunities. I think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in Europe. We see lots of customers that had had accounts at both large Swiss institutions with a consolidation. We're certainly seeing opportunities in our private wealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have. And so that's an area for share that we're focused on. So we continue to look across both Global Banking & Markets and also Asset & Wealth Management for opportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are very well positioned.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on the third-party fundraising. You had another great quarter, but certainly highlighted that a bit slow this year, and I guess that's not surprising given the environment. But could you talk kind of longer term, as you think about maybe a rebound as the economic conditions pick up? And also, the cycling of your vintages of funds in terms of what could be coming on line this year that might result in continued strength or some pockets of slowness as you kind of go through that cycle?\nDenis Coleman: So thanks a lot for the question. Obviously, this remains a big area of strategic focus for us. With $14 billion raised in the first quarter and now up to $193 billion, we feel very good about that. We indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the year, but we do have about 20 offerings in market on diversified basis across asset classes where we're actively looking to raise funds. I think it's really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise that's going to enable us to continue to raise those types of assets. Different strategies will play towards different types of environments and having the breadth of offering, I think, is proving to be beneficial. So even though we indicated it may slow later in this year, strong conviction that we'll be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated, just given what we see across our platform.\nDavid Solomon: And I'd just say, Dan, that one of the things that happens in this business is as you scale and you have the breadth that we have in this business, we set a target for 2024, but there is a longer-term goal on target, and there's lots of room for us to grow and continue to expand our footprint and position given the offering that we have across the broad alternative spectrum, the global nature of our platform. And so this is still -- these are long-dated fundraisings, long-cycle stuff, but there is a lot of runway for us once we get past the 2024 target too.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. And then just a follow-up, Denis, on the expense side. The $1 billion of savings from realization of programs that you highlighted at Investor Day, what was realized in the first quarter? Or maybe just remind us on the pacing of some of those savings as we think about the range of this year?\nDenis Coleman: So at Investor Day, we outlined that over the course of the year, we'd have run rate payroll expense of about $600 million and non-comp efficiency, about $400 million, and we see about half of that reflected in this year and the balance thereafter. I'd say we're on target for those initiatives and those efficiencies. And we continue to look at it, and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efficiency across our platform. One area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of professional fees. We continue to grind that down. And if you look at some of the sequential components of our overall non-compensation expense, you'll see we're making good progress against most of the line items.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, David. Good morning, Denis.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: David, in your comments about your principal investments, you mentioned obviously market conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of $15 billion by the end of '24. In those market conditions, is it more the IPO and ECM markets that have a bigger headwind for you in this area? Or is it just general market levels and the activity we're seeing?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I appreciate the question, Gerard. And I think all these things contribute. Financing availability contributes on certain assets; IPO market can contribute on certain assets, and just general valuations contribute on certain assets. I want to put the comments in perspective because I think that appropriately, we want to make sure people understand obviously that when there is a lot of volatility or there are tough markets, it might slow this down, but we laid out at our Investor Day a plan to move over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal investments. We continue to have a target to get to $15 billion by the end of 2024. We're confident that we're going to execute on that target. So I think the way to think about this is we laid out a multi-year plan to reduce this down to close to zero and we're moving along on that target. I wouldn't take the comments that on any quarter-to-quarter basis, things can slow down. I wouldn't overstate that, but I want people to be aware that if the market or the environment turns more difficult, that could potentially slow us down. But we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to work to execute on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And I know you guys touched on the share repurchases slowing it down a bit and here in the second quarter, you're very well capitalized. If market conditions -- I should ask, I guess, how important is it that the financial markets need to stabilize for you guys to maybe get more aggressive in the second half of the year in buying back the stock?\nDenis Coleman: Thanks for the question. Look, I think it gets back to how we think about our overall capital allocation framework, and we're looking at opportunities to deploy against our client franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment. Given some of the disruption that we're seeing in markets, we want to remain mindful of that. We want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and so we're looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating environment.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. I'd also -- I also just want to highlight, when we spoke at Investor Day, we said clearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks. That is still in place. Quarter-to-quarter may vary, but that is still in place. And so I just want that also kept in perspective too.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\nJames Mitchell: Hi, good morning. I think you hinted at improved dialog levels in underwriting to start the quarter. So can you just give a little more color what you're seeing in the market and maybe how you see the ECM and DCM environment evolving, assuming we don't have another major step back in the macro?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. I think there have been some greenshoots. There were certainly some greenshoots in February. Levels are still muted. There are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some significant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. But I still think we're below trend level. As I said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. Generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. But when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. We're kind of five quarters in. And so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile March, and I'd say things are still slow, but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. And we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year.\nJames Mitchell: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just on FICC financing, I know that's been a focus of growth as well outside of -- equities saw a pretty strong improvement in spreads and volume, but it doesn't look like we saw that in FICC. Anything to think about on the FICC side, on the financing space and how you see that going forward?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Still very, very committed to the FICC financing business, which, as we indicated, was up slightly year-over-year. There continue to be good opportunities to deploy on behalf of clients. I think a lot of the market share progress and client engagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one of the go-to calls for the provision of financing across the FICC space. So that, combined with the equity financing, remain real priorities for our Global Banking & Markets business. We feel good about it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas.\nJeremy Sigee: Thank you. Good morning. Could I get you to talk a bit more about the Credit Suisse opportunity in wealth management? You mentioned Europe, but could you also talk a bit about Asia and Latin America? Are those regions where you as a firm have sufficient strength in wealth management to take more share from the Swiss banks since they are disrupted or is that a bit more marginal for you?\nDavid Solomon: On the second part of the question, I think when you look at Latin America, it's more marginal for us, but there is -- we really do have a global footprint, and there are opportunities for us, especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars around the world. We also have very, very strong Latin American presence that comes into our presence in Florida, obviously, where our private wealth business is focused on Latin America. So there is opportunity there. We continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in Asia. We haven't been as focused on growth and investment in Asia as we have been in Europe over the course of the last couple of years. We did launch a private wealth joint venture over in Asia over the course of the last couple of months with ICBC, which I think is a small and slow opportunity, but is an opportunity for us. I think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation, as we look at very wealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform, they tend to have multiple providers. So whenever there is consolidation, there are opportunities to talk to people as people then rethink their footprint and the diversification of their footprint. And so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients.\nJeremy Sigee: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.\nAndrew Lim: Hi, good morning. So my first question is about your focus on credit cards on the consumer side. Perhaps you can talk more specifically about what you see as your competitive advantages there and how you think about sizing up in credit cards in this point of the cycle. It's perhaps arguably quite late and some would argue that credit card growth tends to be a reflection of individuals not being able to manage expenses in a high inflationary environment.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks. So as you know, we have our card platform business. We've been building that over the next -- over the last several years. We have partnership with General Motors, a partnership with Apple, and we've been steadily investing in those relationships and building our balances. As you indicate, given the overall environment, the total balances actually were down sequentially, just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting standards and origination volumes, but this is a business that we continue to invest in and believe it's an overall piece of the firm that is diversifying.\nAndrew Lim: Great. Okay. I've got a second question more broadly about the crisis that we saw in March and how you think about how it evolved and maybe the repo situation as well. So if we think about the SVB situation, obviously, they decided to sell a lot of their assets below market value, and in the process, crystallizing a lot of those losses. And I guess in retrospect, it would have been a lot easier for them to repo those assets with the Fed and avoid those mark-to-market losses. And I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to maybe why that didn't happen. It would have been obviously to afford a lot of the crisis confidence advice from that situation.\nDavid Solomon: I don't really have a -- I don't have a comment on that, Andrew. There are a variety of factors in the actions that they took. Ultimately, there was a bank run at SVB and that led to the situation we are. But I don't -- I'm not going to go back and recount what decisions that management and that board made around that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. First, Goldman specific and then general. The Goldman specific is why now on the consumer repositioning, GreenSky sale and Marcus loans? And then a more general question. To what degree did Silicon Valley impact the capital markets and the advisory appetite out there? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Thanks, Mike. So first, why now, it's actually not why now. It's like -- it's why over the last 12 months is, as you know, we made a strategic decision kind of 12 months ago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus, and we've been executing on it. And it's not narrowing that focus and making those decisions and executing on it are not things that can be done instantaneously. So we've gone through a very, very thoughtful process and we're moving forward in the execution of that. Again, I think these things also are just not like they're small in the overall scope of Goldman Sachs. The Marcus loan portfolio was profitable but small, wasn't strategic. GreenSky, as we highlighted today, we think it's a good business, good platform, and actually, as we watch it perform, it's performing well. But given the way we've narrowed our focus, not strategic for us. And so we're simply executing on the decisions that we laid out and we'll continue to do things that we think are right over time to deliver for our shareholders. On the second question, which is just what happened in March, how did it affect capital markets and M&A, I think it has a effect. It was a highly -- as I highlighted in my comments, this kind of an unusual few-week period with really, really outsized volatility, and as you and I discussed before, whenever you have that kind of volatility, it slows down capital markets activity. So I thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end of February. I noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well, debt markets are behaving reasonably well. I can't say that there won't be some other event that creates stress. There certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that could create volatility like the negotiation around the debt ceiling, just to point to an example, but I do think when you have that kind of volatility, it slows down or it has people push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital markets. So yes, [technical difficulty] quarter. It was certainly a pretty muted quarter for investment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole.\nOperator: We'll take a follow-up from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you. Just one quick question, Denis, maybe. Around the Apple savings deposit, how do you intend to use the funds that come in? I appreciate early days in terms of the level of inflows that you may get on that product, but is that money just going to sit in cash earning Fed funds? Just trying to figure out what the NII revenue impact could be tied to those deposits.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Ebrahim. So across the firm, we have multiple funding channels, multiple sources that we tap in our BAU activities. We have multiple deposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day. We view this as one incremental and diversifying source of deposits, enables us to deepen our relationship with Apple, tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve together who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of moving into a deposit account. And we'll take those deposits along with all the other deposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nCarey Halio: Yes. Thank you all for calling. We appreciate the time and interest in the firm. And if you have any additional questions, certainly feel free to call me or the rest of the Investor Relations team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you for participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment. We produced net revenues of $12.2 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.79 and an ROE of 11.6% and an ROTE of 12.6%. The first quarter was certainly volatile, particularly for the banking sector. After a fairly benign operating environment at the start of the year, in March, we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the United States. Stress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the financial sector where we saw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order. These stresses were not limited to the U.S., as we saw when regulators help arrange the combination of Switzerland's two largest financial institutions. It's important to appreciate the size of the disruption. Some of the market moves during the period were staggering, particularly in interest rates. To give you a sense of the magnitude, there have been just four days in the past 25 years that have seen two-year yields move by 50 basis points or more intraday. One was in September 2008 and three of them occurred in mid-March this year. Monday, March 13th was the biggest one-day move in the U.S. Treasury two-year yield in over 35 years. As we sit here today, it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us. Prompt action by regulators was vital in bolstering confidence and stabilizing market sentiment. The events of the first quarter acted as another real-life stress test and they demonstrated the resilience of the country's largest financial institutions. The G-SIBs have been a source of strength for the financial system. We joined a consortium with 10 other large institutions in making a $30 billion uninsured term deposit into First Republic Bank to send the strong vote of confidence in and commitment to the U.S. banking sector. As for Goldman Sachs, our long-standing and deeply rooted risk management culture helped us navigate this unusual environment. In our 154-year history, we have lived and managed through many periods of disruption, and it's our rigorous processes and planning for tailored scenarios before the stress that enable us to react quickly and effectively when they do occur. While it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't always execute perfectly, our risk management culture, strong liquidity, and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients. Given this backdrop, it was clear our clients needed help managing their risks and turn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities. Both FICC and Equities had a strong quarter, as we helped clients with their intermediation and financing needs. Underwriting activity, however, remained extremely muted and below recent averages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful way given the market disruption. All-in, Global Banking & Markets delivered industry-leading returns of 16.6%, in line with our through-the-cycle targets even while advisory and capital markets activity remained muted. This franchise continues to show impressive resilience in a variety of market environments, given our broad and diversified set of businesses. Management fees across Asset & Wealth Management grew sequentially, but segment returns were in the mid-single-digits as our on-balance sheet investments remained susceptible to volatility in asset prices. It is a strategic priority to continue to reduce these positions. And while we've made progress, there is still work to do. In Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards profitability. We also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer platform businesses. In the first quarter, we sold a portion of our Marcus loan portfolio and transferred the remainder to held-for-sale. While this activity is now reflected in our AWM segment, it is an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space. Denis will take you through the financial impact of that momentarily. Additionally, we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of GreenSky. We believe GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with first quarter originations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a weighted FICO on total originations of over 780. Given our current strategic priorities however, we may not be the best long-term holder of this business. We will update you on our progress if and when there are material developments. As I close, I'd like to say a few words about the forward outlook. The recent events in the banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a credit contraction given the environment is limiting banks' appetites to extend credit. This is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we're watching closely. Businesses and consumers continue to adjust to higher interest rates. While the forward trajectory is still unclear, we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and we are operating the firm such that we are well prepared in the event that the environment weakens further. Overall, I feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. As the events of the past quarter have illustrated, we are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around the world to continue serving the broad range of clients' needs with excellence. And while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of February, we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & Wealth Management business, and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. And so appreciate the question, and you're right. It has to do with dialogs and things that we can see. I'd say as we came into the new year, there's no questions dialogs have picked up. There's no question -- and I always talk about this when we talk about it broadly, confidence affects the ability for people to move forward to be active in the M&A market and certainly what's gone on over the course of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogs. But when you think about big strategic activity, I think most big companies continue to operate from a position where they're trying to make sure they have the scale and the strength competitively to advance their strategies. And so those strategic dialogs are quite active. And if you actually look over the course of the last week or two, there have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that. We're seeing more dialogs like that and so we're hopeful that more of that will come to fruition. I just think that's a steady part of the diet. The companies need to continue to execute on to improve their strategic position. Now, with respect to financial sponsors, we're still going through a reset. I'm encouraged by the fact in the quarter, we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid offer between the value that a financial sponsor could achieve and the financing price came to a -- came to meet. There was a good data point and a sell-down of a legacy deal in the market, but I would say the financial sponsor activity is still muted and there is more upside as the reset on both value and financing cost continues. I think we're going to get there. I'd expect more in the second half of the year unless there was a really strong, a much more pronounced economic disruption because it just takes time for people to reset. We've now kind of gone through five quarters of reset. And so generally speaking, historically, you kind of see these things turn on after four to six quarters. So I would just expect more of a base level of activity from what's been very, very muted. Yes. So I appreciate the question. I mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just watching what I'd highlight is, I think we had a very solid quarter in FICC. We had nearly a $4 billion quarter. And just to put that in perspective, I think that's a top-decile quarter for that. I think we've had -- I think it was the eighth best quarter on record. I think we've got 96 quarters. So it was a solid performance and just the headline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid FICC quarter. It was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter, and I think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well. Now, some of the noise that I see just from the early morning release, our FICC business was down versus the first quarter of last year by 17%, but in the first quarter of last year, we had significant outperformance. If I remember correctly, our FICC revenues in the first quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the competitor average was kind of flat or down. And you can go look at that from a base perspective. We had much more significant outperformance in the first quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business. So if you remember back in the first quarter of 2022, the war with Ukraine started, there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities. And so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, I think FICC performance in the quarter was strong. We were there to serve our clients. And by any standards, it was a good quarter. I think given the environment that we're operating in, I would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients. It's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of movement and positioning, and so we're finding our clients active at the moment. Yes. So we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on the disposition of our historical principal investments, and we highlighted that we reduced them from just under $30 billion to just over $27 billion during the quarter. Then it's also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the $15 billion target number that we laid out over the course of the next 24 months. We feel good about that progress and we're going to continue to move to reduce that to zero over time. There are a lot of positions. There's no question when there are market headwinds, some of that might go a little bit slower, but we're on pace with what we're trying to do and are committed to it. And obviously, we see a big change in that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments out, the volatility in that business, we believe, will change meaningfully. So I appreciate that question. We're obviously very focused on share and our share gains. We do participate with the hedge fund community, but when you look at our big competitors, they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too. We also are very significant with the broad institutional community. As I said just in the previous question, our clients are active at the moment because there's a lot going on. We're very focused on our market share. As we said in our Investor Day, we laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can advance our position with the top 100 clients that we deal with in our markets business. We continue to be optimistic about our share position, our overall ability to serve our clients, and we do think in this environment, clients will continue to be active. Good morning. Good morning. I think, Betsy, what we said clearly is we're narrowing the focus. We continue to be focused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform. I do think there are opportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think about operating it, but we're going to continue to examine all the things that we can do to make that as successful as possible. As I just highlighted, we don't think we're necessarily the best owner of GreenSky. So we're taking action on that, and then we'll continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform -- the card platforms to profitability. Yes. So appreciate the question, Brennan. The -- we think in transaction banking, we have a very good platform, a very good product. And the feedback that we're getting from clients about the product offering, how it works, what it allows corporate treasuries and CFOs to do is very positive. It's obviously attractive for us to take deposits, but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are operating on our platform. And so we're working hard to make sure, as we're adding clients, we're bringing the value that attaches the technology to what they're doing in a way that grows that platform. We are seeing positive results, but this takes time. These are long-cycle decisions. They're not day-to-day decisions on short-term trades. As Denis highlighted, we had good momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our platform. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. I do think, given the size and the strength of Goldman Sachs, as a G-SIB and the way we're positioned, we're well positioned to compete with our clients for this business, coupled with the fact that we have an excellent product offering. So we are going to stay focused on that and we expect the business to grow over time. So thank you for the question. So obviously this is something that we launched yesterday that gives us another deposit channel. It's the opportunity for somebody that's a credit cardholder to put a deposit on. We've obviously looked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds -- who has a Marcus deposit and that overlap is small, but we'll obviously watch closely to see whether or not there is any cannibalization. But this is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and it's always good for us to broaden our deposit base. And so this is small at the moment and we'll watch it carefully, but I think it's an interesting opportunity for the firm. Well, I think our core banking and markets franchise is incredibly well positioned. You can see the performance this quarter. I certainly wouldn't call it a top quartile for investment banking, traditional capital markets, IPOs, M&A activity. But with a 16.7% ROE in our banking and markets segment, I think it's performing well. We have the breadth, the footprint, the global franchise, I think, to continue to strengthen our share. And as I commented a little bit earlier, we continue to be focused on looking at our performance on the top 100, now expand to the top 150 clients and making sure that we're moving up and capturing share and serving them well. I do think, given some of the things that have gone on, there are other opportunities. I think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in Europe. We see lots of customers that had had accounts at both large Swiss institutions with a consolidation. We're certainly seeing opportunities in our private wealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have. And so that's an area for share that we're focused on. So we continue to look across both Global Banking & Markets and also Asset & Wealth Management for opportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are very well positioned. And I'd just say, Dan, that one of the things that happens in this business is as you scale and you have the breadth that we have in this business, we set a target for 2024, but there is a longer-term goal on target, and there's lots of room for us to grow and continue to expand our footprint and position given the offering that we have across the broad alternative spectrum, the global nature of our platform. And so this is still -- these are long-dated fundraisings, long-cycle stuff, but there is a lot of runway for us once we get past the 2024 target too. Good morning. Well, I appreciate the question, Gerard. And I think all these things contribute. Financing availability contributes on certain assets; IPO market can contribute on certain assets, and just general valuations contribute on certain assets. I want to put the comments in perspective because I think that appropriately, we want to make sure people understand obviously that when there is a lot of volatility or there are tough markets, it might slow this down, but we laid out at our Investor Day a plan to move over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal investments. We continue to have a target to get to $15 billion by the end of 2024. We're confident that we're going to execute on that target. So I think the way to think about this is we laid out a multi-year plan to reduce this down to close to zero and we're moving along on that target. I wouldn't take the comments that on any quarter-to-quarter basis, things can slow down. I wouldn't overstate that, but I want people to be aware that if the market or the environment turns more difficult, that could potentially slow us down. But we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to work to execute on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Yes. I'd also -- I also just want to highlight, when we spoke at Investor Day, we said clearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks. That is still in place. Quarter-to-quarter may vary, but that is still in place. And so I just want that also kept in perspective too. Yes. I think there have been some greenshoots. There were certainly some greenshoots in February. Levels are still muted. There are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some significant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. But I still think we're below trend level. As I said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. Generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. But when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. We're kind of five quarters in. And so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile March, and I'd say things are still slow, but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. And we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year. On the second part of the question, I think when you look at Latin America, it's more marginal for us, but there is -- we really do have a global footprint, and there are opportunities for us, especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars around the world. We also have very, very strong Latin American presence that comes into our presence in Florida, obviously, where our private wealth business is focused on Latin America. So there is opportunity there. We continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in Asia. We haven't been as focused on growth and investment in Asia as we have been in Europe over the course of the last couple of years. We did launch a private wealth joint venture over in Asia over the course of the last couple of months with ICBC, which I think is a small and slow opportunity, but is an opportunity for us. I think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation, as we look at very wealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform, they tend to have multiple providers. So whenever there is consolidation, there are opportunities to talk to people as people then rethink their footprint and the diversification of their footprint. And so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients. I don't really have a -- I don't have a comment on that, Andrew. There are a variety of factors in the actions that they took. Ultimately, there was a bank run at SVB and that led to the situation we are. But I don't -- I'm not going to go back and recount what decisions that management and that board made around that. Yes. Thanks, Mike. So first, why now, it's actually not why now. It's like -- it's why over the last 12 months is, as you know, we made a strategic decision kind of 12 months ago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus, and we've been executing on it. And it's not narrowing that focus and making those decisions and executing on it are not things that can be done instantaneously. So we've gone through a very, very thoughtful process and we're moving forward in the execution of that. Again, I think these things also are just not like they're small in the overall scope of Goldman Sachs. The Marcus loan portfolio was profitable but small, wasn't strategic. GreenSky, as we highlighted today, we think it's a good business, good platform, and actually, as we watch it perform, it's performing well. But given the way we've narrowed our focus, not strategic for us. And so we're simply executing on the decisions that we laid out and we'll continue to do things that we think are right over time to deliver for our shareholders. On the second question, which is just what happened in March, how did it affect capital markets and M&A, I think it has a effect. It was a highly -- as I highlighted in my comments, this kind of an unusual few-week period with really, really outsized volatility, and as you and I discussed before, whenever you have that kind of volatility, it slows down capital markets activity. So I thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end of February. I noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well, debt markets are behaving reasonably well. I can't say that there won't be some other event that creates stress. There certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that could create volatility like the negotiation around the debt ceiling, just to point to an example, but I do think when you have that kind of volatility, it slows down or it has people push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital markets. So yes, [technical difficulty] quarter. It was certainly a pretty muted quarter for investment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole. Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Ebrahim. So across the firm, we have multiple funding channels, multiple sources that we tap in our BAU activities. We have multiple deposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day. We view this as one incremental and diversifying source of deposits, enables us to deepen our relationship with Apple, tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve together who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of moving into a deposit account. And we'll take those deposits along with all the other deposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.79. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.4 billion in the first quarter, which generated an industry-leading ROE for the segment of 16.6%. Advisory revenues of $818 million were down 27% amid lower industry completions. Underwriting revenues continued to be below recent averages and were lower year-over-year. Despite the difficult backdrop, we were number one in the league tables for completed M&A and high-yield debt underwriting. We also ranked second for equity and equity-related underwriting. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter, primarily in Advisory, but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the year and 2024, particularly for strategic M&A. We also expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen broadly, but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogs in the first two weeks of the second quarter. FICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter, down 17%, as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than offset by significantly lower currencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the first quarter of 2022. In FICC financing, revenues rose slightly year-over-year. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter, down 7% year-on-year. A decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record financing revenues of $1.3 billion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances coupled with improved customer spreads. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion rose 24% year-over-year, given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as management and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. Though underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and lending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year, driven by the partial sale of our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions. The associated revenue reduction of $470 million was largely offset by a reserve release of $440 million. Additionally, we benefited from NII and incremental reserve releases associated with paydowns. All-in, the Marcus loan portfolio was profitable for the quarter. Net revenues for equity investments were $119 million, driven by $229 million in revenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public portfolio, partially offset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity portfolio, primarily within real estate. This quarter, we experienced approximately $355 million of impairments on our CIE portfolio, which are reflected in operating expenses. Debt investments revenues were $408 million, driven by net interest income of $363 million. Moving on to Page 6, total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inflows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. We also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49 billion of net inflows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide flows in the money market funds. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $494 million in management and other fees for the quarter. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion, relatively solid given the current environment, and bringing total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day to $193 billion. While we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for the rest of 2023, we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain confident in achieving our 2024 target of $225 billion. On balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $57 billion, of which $27 billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments by $2.3 billion in the quarter. We are committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density, including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by 2024 year-end. I'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues of $564 million more than doubled year-over-year, driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms. This week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Apple through this additional offering and to introduce another source of deposit funding for the firm. In transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus year-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter amid higher deposit costs. As we spoke about at our Investor Day in February, we're focused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service provider. In this regard, we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as our client count grew by approximately 20% in the first quarter. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income of $1.8 billion in the first quarter was down 14% relative to the fourth quarter, driven by increased funding costs supporting training activities within Global Banking & Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $171 million, including the previously mentioned reserve release associated with the Marcus unsecured lending portfolio and model updates, which were only partially offset by roughly $245 million in consumer net charge-offs. Spending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio, as of quarter-end, we had $29 billion of funded CRE loans. This portfolio is diversified by property type and includes $10 billion of exposure in the form of conservatively structured warehouse lending with typical LTVs of approximately 50%. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.4 billion. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter, but up versus last year. The majority of the year-over-year increase was driven by the aforementioned CIE impairments as well as expenses related to NNIP. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. For the full year, we expect a tax rate between 21% and 22%. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, 100 basis points above our current requirement and at the top end of our management buffer. In the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of over $2.5 billion and common stock dividends of roughly $870 million. While we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend, we would note that repurchases in any given quarter will vary. Though we find our stock price attractive at current levels in light of the current environment, we expect to moderate our repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. In conclusion, our first quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile environment. Our robust financial position allowed us to focus on serving our clients and helping them navigate this period of market disruption. Across our leading businesses in Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management, we remain well positioned to continue to support our clients and execute on our strategic priorities. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Glenn, it's Denis. Thanks for the question. I'd say that our conviction around the transaction banking business remains very, very strong. I think what we were able to observe in the first quarter, I highlighted in my script and it's something that we're focused on strategically, is, we grew the client count by about 20% in the quarter, which is a similar amount to all of last year. And we're very, very focused on continuing to improve our position with our clients, offer them more and more services and grow this business steadily over the long-term to create value. I think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the quarter, they were in line with our expectations, and as we indicated, they ended on a quarter-over-quarter basis up just about $1 billion. Sure. Christian, it's Denis. Thank you for the question around capital. And obviously, in this case, appreciating the starting point in Q1, where we significantly increased the amount of buyback activity in Q1. We remain very committed to return of capital to shareholders, committed to sustainably growing our dividend, committing to the overall capital return profile, but we're also observing opportunities to deploy into the franchise on behalf of clients. And there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment. And so our expectations is that buyback activity will be moderated, but we'll monitor that over the course of the quarter. As you say, we do like the stock price and remain committed to return of capital to shareholders. Sure. Thanks. In terms of the overall trajectory for the segment, I think we have to step back. Our number one focus is driving towards profitability. We also mentioned that we look to continue to improve the efficiency ratio. That's certainly over the course of a period of time. Maybe not every given quarter, but we remain committed to what we outlined. As you say, we've seen good top line performance of the business. And on the reserve release, it was a function of owning our point-of-sale business for some period of time, been able to observe it, take in more data. And GreenSky is actually performing better than we had modeled. And so that was a contributor to the reserve release in the segment. As we think about it on a go-forward basis, it's obviously going to be a function of origination activities across the platform. We now have a reserve level of roughly 13% in the consumer space. So that can give you a sense of how to model provisions based on forward origination activity. Thank you. Thank you very much. So let me take that in pieces. In terms of -- on the compensation expense, any charges associated with severance and some of the actions that we took in the first quarter are included within our overall comp accrual, which is a 30% -- 33% of our revenues net of provisions. That's embedded inside of that number. In terms of the change in non-compensation expenses, they were flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis, but did include, as you know, $355 million of CIE impairments. And so we thought it was important to call that out. And that also explains a bunch of the year-over-year delta between Q1 '22 and Q1 '23. That together with full quarter impact of NNIP helps explain the delta in that line for the first quarter of this year. So as we see the capital release from some of those activities, that just gives us incremental flexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back in the franchise and/or returning that capital back to shareholders. So we sold about $1 billion of the Marcus loans and the balance has been moved to held-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time. So we marked the entire -- we sold a portion of the portfolio, and then we marked the balance to market. And you'll see that reflected in the $470 million number moving through net revenues. And our reserve release was $440 million. If you think about the portfolio overall for the quarter, we generated incremental NII, and we had other net paydowns. So for the whole quarter, we generated revenues north of $150 million and it was profitable for the quarter. As we move forward into the second quarter, we'll continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the balance of those exposures. Sure. I appreciate that question. I'll give you some context to help you understand sort of the sequential activity and the direction. So our overall balances were a lot lower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we reduced our footprint. And so as we came into the first quarter, we were able to re-expand the capacity, clients engaged with us. We saw an increase in balances, increase in client activities, increase in customer spreads. We've had in place for some time, a strategy to identify new types of clients that could come on to the platform and engage with us. And so I'd say that we're working sort of full speed ahead on that. We continue to be very, very focused on this as one of the key priorities within the Global Banking & Markets business. So thanks a lot for the question. Obviously, this remains a big area of strategic focus for us. With $14 billion raised in the first quarter and now up to $193 billion, we feel very good about that. We indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the year, but we do have about 20 offerings in market on diversified basis across asset classes where we're actively looking to raise funds. I think it's really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise that's going to enable us to continue to raise those types of assets. Different strategies will play towards different types of environments and having the breadth of offering, I think, is proving to be beneficial. So even though we indicated it may slow later in this year, strong conviction that we'll be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated, just given what we see across our platform. So at Investor Day, we outlined that over the course of the year, we'd have run rate payroll expense of about $600 million and non-comp efficiency, about $400 million, and we see about half of that reflected in this year and the balance thereafter. I'd say we're on target for those initiatives and those efficiencies. And we continue to look at it, and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efficiency across our platform. One area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of professional fees. We continue to grind that down. And if you look at some of the sequential components of our overall non-compensation expense, you'll see we're making good progress against most of the line items. Thanks for the question. Look, I think it gets back to how we think about our overall capital allocation framework, and we're looking at opportunities to deploy against our client franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment. Given some of the disruption that we're seeing in markets, we want to remain mindful of that. We want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and so we're looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating environment. Sure. Still very, very committed to the FICC financing business, which, as we indicated, was up slightly year-over-year. There continue to be good opportunities to deploy on behalf of clients. I think a lot of the market share progress and client engagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one of the go-to calls for the provision of financing across the FICC space. So that, combined with the equity financing, remain real priorities for our Global Banking & Markets business. We feel good about it. Sure. Thanks. So as you know, we have our card platform business. We've been building that over the next -- over the last several years. We have partnership with General Motors, a partnership with Apple, and we've been steadily investing in those relationships and building our balances. As you indicate, given the overall environment, the total balances actually were down sequentially, just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting standards and origination volumes, but this is a business that we continue to invest in and believe it's an overall piece of the firm that is diversifying."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, October 15th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, operator, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $12.7 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.40 an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11.1%. Overall, I am pleased with our performance especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected items including the narrowing of our consumer footprint which reduced our ROE by 80 basis points. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises where we were effectively serving clients in a complex backdrop. Global Banking and Markets, we remained premier M&A advisor and a leading global risk intermediary. Across investment banking, corporate and sponsors remained actively engaged and we see significant pent-up demand from our clients. Our backlog rose again this quarter driven by advisory and we expect our leading investment banking franchises to benefit from the continued resurgence in activity. In FIC, we delivered record financing revenues and facilitated our clients\u2019 risk intermediation needs, particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter. And in equities, we reported a very strong performance across both intermediation and financing. Overall, our global broad e-platform remained exceptionally well positioned to support our clients\u2019 evolving needs across products and asset classes. In the Asset and Wealth Management, our position as a leading global active asset manager the top five alternatives player and a premier ultra-high network franchise afford us significant opportunities in secular growth areas. Our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter surpassing $3 trillion, and representing our 27th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows. We demonstrated further growth and more durable management, other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year. We remain confident in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high single digit pace over the coming years, and alternatives fundraising remains strong. We raised over $50 billion year-to-date, and now expect 2024 fundraising to exceed 60 billion, as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity, secondaries, and infrastructure. Wealth management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion, and our ultra-high net worth franchise is well positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading offerings and our lending offerings to clients. Our pre-tax margin and AWM is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid-20s target. We remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business, while also investing to drive growth across wealth management alternatives and solutions. As I look at the operating backdrop, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient. Inflation has been coming down, the recent unemployment data is supportive, and while we have seen some softness in consumer behavior, the tone of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructed. The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity. More broadly, clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world. The policy implications of global elections, particularly in the U.S. and the high levels of geopolitical instability. Against this backdrop are leading global franchises in supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves for a range of outcomes. Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on capital and Basel III revision. Although, we have closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory officials about the upcoming reproposal, we continue to have concerns about the overall regulatory process. There remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book, CCAR and the G-SIB buffer. We recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time, but as we've said before, we need to get this right. The final rule have a significant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Requiring too much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small, and will impact growth across the country. We look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and participating in the new comment period. We remain very engaged both as an industry and as a firm. In closing, I feel very good about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. We are leaning into our strengths. Our client franchise is stronger than ever, and we continue to harness our one Goldman Sachs approach. Our world-class talent, execution capabilities, and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a firm and allow us to provide differentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $8.40 up 54% year-over-year. ROE was 10.4% and ROTE of 11.1%. As David mentioned, our results were impacted by select items, including agreements to transition the GM card platform and to sell our portfolio of seller financing norms. In aggregate, these items reduced EPS by $0.62 and our ROE by 80 basis points. Now turning to performance by segment starting on Page 4. Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $875 million were up both sequentially and versus the prior year period. We remain number one in the league tables for announced and completed M&A for the year to date. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year over year to $385 million. As equity capital markets have continued to reopen, though volumes are still well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 46% year over year to 605 million amid higher leverage finance and investment grade activity. We are seeing increased client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Overall, our investment banking backlog rose quarter on quarter driven by advisory. FIC net revenues of $3 billion in the quarter were down from a strong performance last year amid a relatively quieter summer, though we saw a meaningful pickup in activity in September. A decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record FIC financing revenues of $949 million, which rose 30% year over year, primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion dollars in the quarter up 18% versus the prior year. Equities intermediation revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by strong performance across derivatives and cash products. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion rose versus the prior year amid higher average balances. Across FIC and equities financing revenues were a record $6.6 billion for the year to date. A direct result of the successful execution on our strategic priority to improve the durability of our revenue base. Moving to Asset and Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 16% year over year. Our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.4 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.6 billion for the quarter and $7.6 billion for the year to-date well on the way to achieving our $10 billion annual target for 2024. Private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to 756 million. We are seeing positive momentum in this business, and we remain focused on increasing lending penetration and expanding our loan product offerings. Incentive fees for the quarter were $85 million. We continue to expect to reach our annual target of $1 billion over the medium term, supported by approximately $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of the last quarter. Equity and debt investments revenues totaled $294 million reflecting NII in our debt portfolio and markups in our public equity portfolio. For the year to date, we generated one and a half billion in combined equity and debt investments revenues. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $3.1 trillion, bolstered by $37 billion of liquidity products net inflows, and $29 billion of long-term net inflows across asset classes. We continue to see traction in our solutions business where we are leveraging our SMA capabilities and outsource CIO platform to deliver customized multi-asset solutions. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $328 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $527 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $16 billion in the third quarter and over $50 billion for the year-to-date. This brings cumulative third-party fundraising to more than $300 billion since our Investor Day in 2020. We further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.7 billion in the third quarter to $10.9 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $5.4 billion. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income was $2.6 billion in the quarter up versus the prior year period, reflecting an increase in interest earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $192 billion up year-over-year, driven by an increase in other collateralized lending. For the third quarter, our provision for credit losses was $397 million, primarily driven by net charge offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by $70 million of net recoveries on previously impaired wholesale loans. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.3 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.2 billion down 14% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the firm, given ongoing inflationary pressures, competition for talent, and our desire to invest in our engineering and technology platforms. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.6%. For the full year, we continued to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on Slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $2 billion to common shareholders, including dividends of 978 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.6% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve reduced our SEB requirement by 20 basis points to 6.2%, following a successful appeal process, resulting in a standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio requirement of 13.7%, which became effective October 1st. We remain very engaged with our regulators on creating a less volatile and more transparent process. Given our 90-basis point buffer, we continue to have flexibility on capital deployment and are very well positioned to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders. In conclusion, our overall performance reflected the strength of our client franchise and the improving operating environment. We are executing on our strategy where we are maintaining and strengthening our leadership positions across Global Banking and Markets and leaning into secular growth opportunities in Asset and Wealth Management. Across both businesses, we are making strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams. Simply put, we are playing to our strengths as a firm and we remain confident in our ability to drive returns for shareholders while continuing to support our clients. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: So, trading question, I mean, markets business has been great, markets have been supportive. But I guess my question is to your comments on the regulatory perception perhaps of trading in general, and August looked like a spike in volatility, but looks like you did really well. This marks many quarters that you and others have done very well for years. Do you feel the business is managed better? Do you feel like your results mean anything towards the outcome on the regulatory side? I'm just curious on what the, if the evidence matters.\nDavid Solomon: I appreciate the question, Glenn, and I mean, it's a hard question to answer. I think we've been clear on some of the advocacy we're doing around the regulatory process, but I've also been clear on regulatory environments, ebb and flow and that people can be policy. And so, overtime, you see shifts in all this. And our job, and I think we've done this effectively over a very long period of time, is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the different regulatory environments. With respect to the business of markets which includes FIC intermediation and FIC financing and equities intermediation and equities financing, I think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that we've invested in over a long period of time. We have deep, deep client relationships, clients who rely on us for a package of services and that's not going away. And certainly, in this environment, this is an environment that's filled with uncertainty their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very, very active, on a broad global scale. I think that we've done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that I think have made the business more durable. Certainly, our focus and our emphasis on financing and the way we've grown and managed the financing businesses puts a level of durability into the business that's different than when the businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses. But intermediation continues to be an important service, and when you really step back and you step out a quarter to quarter and you look more year to year or year over year, these are very broad franchises across numerous silos, and they tend to be more resilient and more consistent than one might see when you look quarter to quarter. So, we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned, we\u2019ll continue to invest in it and grow it. I think one of the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world. They're correlated to market cap growth in the world. And as long as you believe, over the medium and long term, those trends will continue with our capital generation we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises over time, and we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that. How the regulators respond to that over time, I really think is a separate question. And we'll continue to be actively engaged, as we've said to you, we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. This one will be a short follow-up. With HPI was weak, but that'll happen on any given quarter. I think if you look over a long period of time, you've earned good returns on your historical principal investments. But as that book shrinks the 10.9 that's left, the 4 billion attributed to it, if I take a, should I -- is it okay to take a historical ROE on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going forward on HPI?\nDenis Coleman: Glenn, its Denis. I guess what I would suggest you take a look at, we have obviously a commitment to reducing the balance of the historical principal investments. As we continue to have success doing that, there will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved off of the balance sheet. But you will still see revenue generation associated with some of the co-invest positions that we retain as a piece of driving our overall growth of our third party fund management business as to guidance on future projected returns on that portfolio, I don't think I have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns, but I would suggest to you that we have a very diversified portfolio of exposures and a long standing track record of delivering good returns for our clients.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I just had a follow-up first on trading and maybe David would appreciate your perspective around when we read about non-bank trading venues, getting into fixed income markets, potentially sort of disrupting the business for the incumbents. Comment on that you may, you could in terms of other parallels to the equity business that we should draw? And how much of a competitive threat are the non-bank/non-regulated entities, especially given your comments around the regulatory backdrop and kind of the Basel game, reproposal and the opaqueness around that? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Yes, sure Ebrahim, and I appreciate the question. This gets a lot of attention, particularly in the press. But I think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about. And look, the equities journey is a relatively good journey. There's been lots of -- first of all, there's lots of competition in all these businesses. There's always been competition, but there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital allocators and asset managers in the world, the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an integrated basis. And that's very, very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients. There can always be competition and there always will be competition. I just highlight, our equity business is as large and as scaled and as profitable as ever. Even though over the last 25 years, there's been enormous competition in the equity business. There's been digitization, there's been changed, there are now a handful. By handful, I'd say less than a handful. There are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of the credit spaces, et cetera. And will they compete and will they win business? Of course, they'll win business. But these are big, big markets. We offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider, financier of those clients, which by the way is very, very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem works. While these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive, again, we feel very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these spaces.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Understood. And just a follow-up on -- back to ROE and conversations with investors around. You have done a good job over the last year or two, performance has been strong. Stocks reflected that. As we think about the journey here from a 12%, 13% ROE to something that's maybe 15% plus, the building blocks, one could argue that the market backdrop, not the best, but not the worst. What needs to happen for Goldman to get to a point where we are registering a 15%-type ROE on a more recurring basis? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Well, I appreciate the question. And we've been very clear, we have a mid-teens target and that we believe we are on the journey of executing towards it. I think the first thing that has to happen is we need to continue to execute over a period of time to deliver on that. And again, I think it's a pretty simple building block of a story. First, we have a Global Banking and Markets business, and you can go look at the performance over the last five years of that business and the returns that, that business has delivered. I would say that I still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity, and I just highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved, and we've made progress, we are still not operating at 10-year averages in M&A and equity volumes. M&A volumes year-to-date are 13% below 10-year averages. Now that's better than the 25% below 10-year averages that they were for the first nine months of last year and equity volumes at 27% below 10-year averages. Now that's better than the 34% to 35% that they were below 10-year averages for the first nine months last year. But there's no reason why we're not going to get back to 10-year average is a tailwind, but you can look at the performance in banking and markets, and that's one building block in the foundation for mid-teens returns. The second is our continued progress, which requires more time and more execution on our part around Asset and Wealth Management. And while we've improved the margins, we still have work to do on the margins and also the returns, and we continue to be very focused. But we are confident over the course of the next few years that we can bring the returns of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise into the mid-teens. The next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag associated with the platform business, that will get to a point where it basically becomes negligible. It's getting closer to that. And so, if you put those building blocks together, Global Banking and Markets, its actual performance with a little bit more of a tailwind, which obviously it benefits from continued progress on Asset and Wealth Management, that is our business, and we should be able to deliver those returns. We're focused on it. We have more work to do, but that is the path, and I think it's pretty clear.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\nChristian Bolu: Can you hear me? I just have a question on the trading business and the competitive landscape. How are you thinking about the -- maybe the broader competitive landscape with the -- with other banks? Your market share seemed to peak in 2022. It's been a bit choppy since then as a market share. Just curious, are you seeing signs of competitors coming back, increasing competition from anywhere. I'm just curious on your thoughts there.\nDavid Solomon: When you have leading market shares, our Global Banking & Markets franchise, you bounce around at different levels based on short-term activity, but what I'd say is if you step back and you look over the last five years, we took a step function up in our market share broadly across the plot. And so, from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see variability. But I still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position, and we're zealously focused on them. We're zealously focused on the top 150 clients, which obviously make a huge contribution to the markets business. We're obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there. And obviously, in a better M&A environment where there's more large cap M&A. You do see some movement in our market share. So that's a market share tailwind for us. They've always been competitive business, Christian. Again, we think we're very well positioned with our clients and have deep trusting long-term relationships and through our one Goldman Sachs operating ethos, a history of delivering for them through the cycle. There's always going to be competition, but we like the way our business is positioned. And I don't see anything that fundamentally changes that, but have operated in these businesses. We've operated in these businesses for a long time. There are always going to be competitive businesses.\nChinedu Bolu: Okay. On Private Banking, just another set of very strong results there, I think revenue growth up 10%. And if I'm doing my math correctly, organic flows are in the high single-digit range, which would put you, I think, best in class. So just remind us again like what's driving strength there? And then maybe any key initiatives for growth over the next couple of years that should help sustain this growth.\nDavid Solomon: Sure, I'll start. I don't know Denis might have something to add. But at a high level, this is a strategic decision that we have this big ultra-high net worth platform, and we were underinvested in lending to those clients. And there's a lot of historical reasons for why that's the case, starting with the fact that 15 years ago, we want a bank. And so, we really didn't look at the world that way. But lending into an ultra-high net worth franchise is a very good business, and it's a very important part of the business. And we understand that we've learned and we've seen it through investment banking, and we've seen it through market that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your client, including lending, you improve your market share position. So, when you look at our wealth franchise versus under other wealth franchises, we've been underpenetrated the lending to those wealth clients and we put in place resources a leadership team on a focused effort to increase that activity to these clients. While we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like JPMorgan, and I would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability for our clients. And Denis I don't know if there's anything you want to add on that?\nDenis Coleman: The only thing I'd amplify, which I think we've mentioned before, we feel like we've run this play before. So, we worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of services we provided them, improved our market share position with those clients. We've implemented the same thing across the GBM public businesses of FICC and equities. We stand underpenetrated relative to peers today, and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to the clients in the wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with those clients. As David said, we are allocating incremental resources, more specialist capabilities and giving our advisers the confidence to offer a competitive product to their clients to improve the overall relationship they have with their clients.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: The first question relates to why do you stop platform solution sets of business line? And what's happening with the Apple Card? And do you plan to exit that and take charges for that? And kind of what's going on with that? Again, two-thirds of the firm's global banking market, one-third is wealth and asset management, and then you have this kind of extra business there.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Thanks, Mike. I mean I know there's a lot of focus on that. I think we've been pretty clear in our messaging that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint. I don't have a lot more to say about where we are with Apple Card other than we're running it and improving it. And that's really all that I have to say. But I think the direction of travel at this point is pretty clear.\nMike Mayo: Well, back to the core business then, you said M&A is still 13% below 10-year averages. To what degree are 10-year averages less relevant because of the sponsor activity. You guys have said -- it seems like everyone has a different number, whether it's $1 trillion or $3 trillion of dry powder out there by sponsors that are ready, willing and able to pursue acquisitions. And I don't think you've ever had that level of dry powder before. So, could this be an M&A super cycle because all that money gets put to work? And if so, how would you change that 10-year average to adjust for that?\nDavid Solomon: I mean, one, I think there are long-term secular trends around M&A and market cap, which, by the way, are also meaningfully below trend I think that's more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact that there has not been a lot of large-cap M&A with the market cap expansion, especially around TAP, that might be permanent. It might not, but my guess is that will ebb and flow from time to time. But your sponsor point, Mike, is a very, very good point. And the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to turn on than I would have expected, but they will turn on. By the way, if that -- all that dry powder is deployed okay, M&A volumes versus the 10-year averages will go up. But by the way, if we were sitting here five years ago, 10-year average was lower five years ago than it is today because the 10-year average is definitely correlated to market cap growth and economic growth. So, I do think we'll operate a 10-year averages. I do think over time, by the end of the decade, the 10-year average will actually be higher that it's been with a historical lens. But I will say at the point lower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity. Some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we've highlighted. And I do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next 6, 12, 24 months.\nOperator: We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Can you hear me okay? Okay, super. Yes, I totally agree. We've been calling for capital markets rebound. It's really nice to see it coming through. Two questions. One on the expanding loan offerings that you mentioned earlier. And I know we touched on it briefly in the Q&A. Just a few questions ago. What I wanted to make sure I understood is, when you think about the RWA impact of reducing the private investments that you're doing, you're reducing that portfolio and then increasing the expanded loan offerings into Asset & Wealth Management. Do you see that as RWA neutral is the density of the loan offerings higher or lower than the investment, the private equity investments that you've got?\nDenis Coleman: Sure, Betsy. Very good question. So generally speaking, the density of the HPI that we have left to sell down is high and the density asset and wealth loans is low. So, migrating RWA towards the lending businesses improves the durability, the predictability, the recurring nature of it, it brings forth the holistic access to the clients, all their wealth management needs and it is more capital efficient for us. So that is an underpinning component of the strategy as well.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay, super. Right, because it's collateralized heavily, right? Okay. Then the other question I had was just on the GM cut. I wanted to make sure I understood this. So as far as I get it's signed but not closed yet. So, can you give us a sense as to when you think it's going to close? And are there any trailers in your P&L when it does close, for example, anything we should be aware of with regard to either payments to on the contract to GM? Or is there like a lot of cap that you have to be involved in? I'm just trying to make sure I understand how to model this as we go forward.\nDenis Coleman: Sure, Betsy. So, in terms of timing, it's signed but not closed. There has to be a conversion to the new issuer and then ultimately at closing of the platform transfer expectations we're targeting Q3 of 2025. So that's sort of timing from a modeling perspective. And I guess what I would tell you, we obviously have responsibility for operating the platform until that point in time. So, we will continue to incur call it, the run rate operating losses associated with that business. As a guide, I'd point you to where we were in Q1 and Q2 of this year, something on the order of negative $50 million or $60 million per quarter, just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here until closing.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I wanted to follow up a little bit on the investment backlog commentary. I know you said that advisory drove a lot of the growth in the backlog. But we did see some sponsors recently to the IPO market with some success. And so curious about what you're seeing on the ECM and IPO side, particularly as we see early signs of sponsors reengaging with that distribution channel?\nDavid Solomon: So, thanks for the question, Brennan. I mean there's no question equity activity picked up. But as I highlighted a few moments ago, volumes are still running 25% below 10-year averages. And IPOs running even more significantly below 10-year averages. I do think the sponsors, again, some of it is sponsor monetization. And because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher, they've been slow and they're kind of waiting for growth to bring up some of the values. But I do see an acceleration of activity and I expect it to continue, and there's no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldn't run a 10-year averages. And that those averages will grow over time with a growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of sponsored capital.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. And then we've seen several partnerships and some innovation getting announced in the private credit world recently. And given your heritage in that business, how do you plan to approach and prosecute that opportunity?\nDavid Solomon: Sure. We have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a one GS way, to some degree, on a differentiated way than many of the people we compete with. We obviously, as a credit originator in our investment banking business are one of the leading credit originators is not a leading position in leveraged loans and high-yield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that, we obviously, we originate and distribute. We also in our Asset & Management business, we are a leading player in private credit with $140 billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that. I think one of the things that's interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the street, there is plenty of capital that is interesting in deploying into private credit. The valuable part of the ecosystem is origination channels. And there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting origination channels and paltforms. But I would say when you look across Goldman Sachs, our origination ecosystem across both our Global Banking & Networks business and also in our Asset & Wealth Management business, is unique and differentiated and something that I think will continue to differentiate the firm as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform.\nOperator: We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: I wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the self-help levers, recognizing that the business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the noncore assets, whether it's in consumer or equity investments. Denis, I believe in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an 80 bp drag on ROE from consumer. And I was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture, just frame the drag on returns from various noncore activities today. And are there any remaining self-help levers that could bolster returns which may still be on the come?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. I think the 80-basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items, which we have identified as the selected items, which we have announced, we are in the process of disposing of. Obviously, if we complete -- if we were to completely exit all consumer-related activities, there would be more associated capital relief potential. And we can obviously across the AWM franchise moved down the vast majority of the HPI exposure, that currently has a little over $4 billion of attributed equity associated with it. So, you have the dynamic of sort of reducing the P&L components. And then over time, we will remove the capital. So, removing the capital associated with HPI and then ultimately moving the capital associated with the consumer businesses that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. And just for a follow-up on buybacks. Just stock is currently trading at 1.6x book, does suggest some expectation in the market for returns to get closer to mid-teens ROE target. Just wanted to hear your perspective on price sensitivity to buy back at current valuation levels and in anticipation, at least of David's response, citing prioritization of organic growth where do you see the most attractive opportunities to deploy capital organically today?\nDenis Coleman: Our capital deployment philosophy unchanged. I think if you take some of our comments in the prepared remarks about the outlook that we have, some of the engagement we're seeing from clients, potential opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition financing, that is an activity that's very core to Goldman Sachs. We have a historical leading market share position there given netting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities. And so that would be an attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across wealth and the financing business and public is an attractive place to deploy capital. And that is our priority as we sit here today with our 90 basis point buffer heading into the fourth quarter. But we also remain very committed, as we've said before, to sustainably growing our dividend. That's a core part of our philosophy. And we do believe it's important to also continue to return capital to shareholders. We do have a higher valuation. We do think about that. We are sensitive to that, but I don't believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldn't be also returning capital to shareholders.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan: Question on just the alternative asset management fundraising. And looking at the fee rates. So, the largest at bucket corporate equity is seeing a declining fee rate since the end of 2022. I know there were some legacy funds in there that are sensing, but it would just be great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rates, just given all that fundraising that you've done in alts in recent years. And just when we should think about the inflection occurring as recently raised AUM moves into fee earnings? And then we should think about kind of the right steady state because it would seem like out there.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Obviously, we put that disclosure out there, so you can track it and follow it over time. It's obviously very much mix dependent in terms of the nature of the particular at assets that are coming in thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our asset management franchise, an important to a lot of our investment in our clients are the services we provide through our OCIO offerings. But in certain of those portfolios, we do bring on board some Alts assets and the effective fee associated with that is lower than paid Goldman Sachs fund generated alternative fee. So, we have a multichannel asset accumulation strategy that we're deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business. And for us, having scale is an important contributor, ultimately, to driving margins, efficiencies and returns in the business, but not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee. So, you may see some slight variation in that over time.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the trading business, obviously, results have been incredibly resilient and the firm has gained market share. And so, I'd love to get a little bit of a flavor, if you can, just around how much of trading revenue today is driven by your electronic trading capabilities and how that's evolved over the past handful of years. I know there's been a lot of investment there, and you guys have some pretty differentiated offering. So, I just wanted to get a little bit of sense of that. And then how that plays into the story of market share from here just as you become more relevant with clients.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks for the question. I mean we look at equity and then frankly, even FICC trading activities, the strategy facing clients is multichannel again. So, we have voice. We have high-touch voice, and we have electronic, and increasingly, we're finding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients. So, we have both, call it, run rate, more plain vanilla intermediation activities. Now we have the capacity to either take on board more interesting structure or complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process. and the approach is to have a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Denis, I want to come back to a comment you made about reiterating the $1 billion goal for performance fees. And I think you said $4 billion of unrecognized gains. You're obviously run rating well below that here year-to-date. Can you talk about the time period you think to get to that $1 billion? And is there seasonality with certain maybe liquid products that are typically more recognized in the fourth quarter? Or is this something that should be more pro rata?\nDenis Coleman: So, the $4 billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying, completing harvesting and migrating their way to the end to their investment cycle. Given a lot of the other commentary that we've been discussing about level of activity, strategically, openness of capital markets, in particular, equity capital markets, sponsor monetization activity, et cetera, as it relates to our portfolio where we own some balance sheet investments, and we own investments in funds, we have not had as much monetization in line with where the market has been generally. So as activity improves, we will also see more monetization and we expect that over the next several years, we will move towards those medium-term targets of a run rate, $1 billion worth of incentive fees. But I can't tell you exactly the rates that comes in, that will be dependent on how ultimately these funds harvest and when we're in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive fees.\nDan Fannon: Got it. And then just a follow-up on wealth management, understanding the strategy of growing lending. But can you talk about the growth overall of the adviser base and how you're thinking about that over the next kind of one to two years in terms of net recruiting, hires and ultimately, investment in that business beyond just diversifying the revenue streams?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, I think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisers needs to be a strategic and sustained investment program. So rather than having it a sort of ebb and flow across different market environments or based on what the firm's perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at different years in the past. I think part of the strategy of investing in what is a really outstanding business at Goldman Sachs, where we're the premier ultra-high net worth firm, we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisers over multiple years. And so that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how we're looking to invest in that business. And when David makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across AWM and that we are focused not just on margins and returns, but investing to grow. One of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow is actually in the adviser footprint.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys share with us your Goldman is in a unique position, I think, to be able to share with investors the benefits of private credit. I think, David, you mentioned you have $140 billion in private credit assets. And when you see your clients choosing a channel to access monies from you, whether it's private credit or just lending. Can you share with us the advantages that you see through private credit or the regular loan portfolio that your customers may benefit from?\nDavid Solomon: So, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think one of the things that's interesting about this is, this gets framed in very binary ways. And obviously, private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things. It certainly refers to a lot of investment-grade lending, a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets. It can refer to direct lending in the below investment-grade business, which, by the way, is a component of our syndication activity and origination activity, particularly with sponsors. It can be direct lending for small and medium-sized enterprises. So, there's a wide range of things. When I listened to your question, when I pull away as you're asking in particular about leverage finance activity and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital. And I'd say they don't go in through the bias, they're actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution. And I think that one of the things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite distribute. We have an ability to direct lend. We have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs and their might needs might be different in different transactional situation. So, we like our positioning there. I do say that I believe from a secular perspective, there will be continued growth in private credit, particularly in the leveraged finance space. And so, we're looking to capture that. but it's more complicated. There are different channels, there's different origination efforts than sometimes the way this is all for trade. But we feel like we're well positioned across the spectrum to be a significant participant in this space.\nGerard Cassidy: And David, just a quick follow-up on that. That was very thorough. Who do you find these your primary competitors? Again, you're in a unique position, I think, to be able to benefit from this. Who do you bump into the most?\nDavid Solomon: Well, it depends what you're doing. So, it goes back to exactly what I said it, it depends what you're doing. If you're in the leverage finance market and you're looking at a syndicated capital structure and you're competing for that, you're going to bump into JPMorgan, for example. If on the other hand, you're looking at direct lenders, then you're going to bump into a bunch of people that play a leading role in that space, which can include people like HPS or Ares or other direct platforms. If you're looking at investment grade, insurance company balance sheet, you might run into Apollo. I mean it really depends on who the client is, what their need is and what the activity is. And it's actually quite a broad and complicated space.\nDenis Coleman: I mean the only thing I'd add, Gerard, if you just think about it, I think David has laid this out really well. If you think about where Goldman Sachs is positioned against this opportunity set. We have capacity to lend to alternative clients, for example, who are deploying into the private credit space. We have the capacity to underwrite and distribute different types of investment-grade and noninvestment-grade capital structures and we have the capacity to offer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposed to the asset class. And while we compete with all of those different parties that David enumerated, I'm hard-pressed to find many people that have the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us. So we really like our position in terms of the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC.\nSaul Martinez: I wanted to ask about the margin trajectory in Asset & Wealth Management. Year-to-date, you're at -- you got a 24% pretax margin. You've already reach the mid-20s medium-term target. I know you've talked about that margin expanding beyond mid-20s. But how do we think about where it can ultimately land in the time horizon around it? Obviously, you're growing your all business, you have $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees. You talked about the private banking and lending platform. Just can you get to a pretax margin of above 30% like your peers? And again, how do we think about the glide path from here and the time horizon around that?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thank you, Saul. So obviously, we've just arrived at our mid-20s target. I think it's important that we consolidate our position there. We think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as we scale top line, as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform, and we look to drive other operating efficiencies across the business segment. There are plenty of competitors that have margins as you cite, that are 30% or higher. So, our commitment is to continue to improve the margins. But we're also thinking increasingly about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the long term. So, we are going to try and find the balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long-term value in this segment. But for the time being, we think that both can be achieved.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could follow up on capital and just how you're thinking I know you talked about your capital strategy a bit. But how are you thinking about just capital allocation buybacks given the uncertainty around Basel, we have a proposal, we have the speech outlining the reproposal. We have an agency that seemingly one of the agencies, obviously, resisting seemingly the reproposal. We have an election that could play a big role in terms of influencing whatever outcome happens. So just -- I mean, how are you thinking about your capital? And why do you think a 90-basis point buffer is the write buffer given all that uncertainty.\nDenis Coleman: Okay. Thank you. Look, what I would say for the last period of quarters and years, we've been operating in an environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty. There's also been operating uncertainty as well. I think the economic trajectory, outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus frankly, that presents opportunities. So, we run a buffer so that we have pent-up capacity to support incoming client opportunities. But we also run the buffer given other uncertainties in the world, which include regulatory. As to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital position, I couldn't tell you right now. But we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we get that regulatory feedback. From everything we know, there are generally time lines associated with those rules coming into effect. And we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be prepared for other unexpected developments, including regulatory.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the third quarter, we produced net revenues of $12.7 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.40 an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11.1%. Overall, I am pleased with our performance especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected items including the narrowing of our consumer footprint which reduced our ROE by 80 basis points. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises where we were effectively serving clients in a complex backdrop. Global Banking and Markets, we remained premier M&A advisor and a leading global risk intermediary. Across investment banking, corporate and sponsors remained actively engaged and we see significant pent-up demand from our clients. Our backlog rose again this quarter driven by advisory and we expect our leading investment banking franchises to benefit from the continued resurgence in activity. In FIC, we delivered record financing revenues and facilitated our clients' risk intermediation needs, particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter. And in equities, we reported a very strong performance across both intermediation and financing. Overall, our global broad e-platform remained exceptionally well positioned to support our clients' evolving needs across products and asset classes. In the Asset and Wealth Management, our position as a leading global active asset manager the top five alternatives player and a premier ultra-high network franchise afford us significant opportunities in secular growth areas. Our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter surpassing $3 trillion, and representing our 27th consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows. We demonstrated further growth and more durable management, other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year. We remain confident in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high single digit pace over the coming years, and alternatives fundraising remains strong. We raised over $50 billion year-to-date, and now expect 2024 fundraising to exceed 60 billion, as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity, secondaries, and infrastructure. Wealth management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion, and our ultra-high net worth franchise is well positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading offerings and our lending offerings to clients. Our pre-tax margin and AWM is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid-20s target. We remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business, while also investing to drive growth across wealth management alternatives and solutions. As I look at the operating backdrop, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient. Inflation has been coming down, the recent unemployment data is supportive, and while we have seen some softness in consumer behavior, the tone of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructed. The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity. More broadly, clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world. The policy implications of global elections, particularly in the U.S. and the high levels of geopolitical instability. Against this backdrop are leading global franchises in supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves for a range of outcomes. Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on capital and Basel III revision. Although, we have closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory officials about the upcoming reproposal, we continue to have concerns about the overall regulatory process. There remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book, CCAR and the G-SIB buffer. We recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time, but as we've said before, we need to get this right. The final rule have a significant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. Requiring too much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small, and will impact growth across the country. We look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and participating in the new comment period. We remain very engaged both as an industry and as a firm. In closing, I feel very good about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. We are leaning into our strengths. Our client franchise is stronger than ever, and we continue to harness our one Goldman Sachs approach. Our world-class talent, execution capabilities, and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a firm and allow us to provide differentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail. I appreciate the question, Glenn, and I mean, it's a hard question to answer. I think we've been clear on some of the advocacy we're doing around the regulatory process, but I've also been clear on regulatory environments, ebb and flow and that people can be policy. And so, overtime, you see shifts in all this. And our job, and I think we've done this effectively over a very long period of time, is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the different regulatory environments. With respect to the business of markets which includes FIC intermediation and FIC financing and equities intermediation and equities financing, I think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that we've invested in over a long period of time. We have deep, deep client relationships, clients who rely on us for a package of services and that's not going away. And certainly, in this environment, this is an environment that's filled with uncertainty their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very, very active, on a broad global scale. I think that we've done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that I think have made the business more durable. Certainly, our focus and our emphasis on financing and the way we've grown and managed the financing businesses puts a level of durability into the business that's different than when the businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses. But intermediation continues to be an important service, and when you really step back and you step out a quarter to quarter and you look more year to year or year over year, these are very broad franchises across numerous silos, and they tend to be more resilient and more consistent than one might see when you look quarter to quarter. So, we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned, we'll continue to invest in it and grow it. I think one of the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world. They're correlated to market cap growth in the world. And as long as you believe, over the medium and long term, those trends will continue with our capital generation we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises over time, and we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that. How the regulators respond to that over time, I really think is a separate question. And we'll continue to be actively engaged, as we've said to you, we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately. Yes, sure Ebrahim, and I appreciate the question. This gets a lot of attention, particularly in the press. But I think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about. And look, the equities journey is a relatively good journey. There's been lots of -- first of all, there's lots of competition in all these businesses. There's always been competition, but there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital allocators and asset managers in the world, the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an integrated basis. And that's very, very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients. There can always be competition and there always will be competition. I just highlight, our equity business is as large and as scaled and as profitable as ever. Even though over the last 25 years, there's been enormous competition in the equity business. There's been digitization, there's been changed, there are now a handful. By handful, I'd say less than a handful. There are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of the credit spaces, et cetera. And will they compete and will they win business? Of course, they'll win business. But these are big, big markets. We offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider, financier of those clients, which by the way is very, very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem works. While these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive, again, we feel very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these spaces. Well, I appreciate the question. And we've been very clear, we have a mid-teens target and that we believe we are on the journey of executing towards it. I think the first thing that has to happen is we need to continue to execute over a period of time to deliver on that. And again, I think it's a pretty simple building block of a story. First, we have a Global Banking and Markets business, and you can go look at the performance over the last five years of that business and the returns that, that business has delivered. I would say that I still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity, and I just highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved, and we've made progress, we are still not operating at 10-year averages in M&A and equity volumes. M&A volumes year-to-date are 13% below 10-year averages. Now that's better than the 25% below 10-year averages that they were for the first nine months of last year and equity volumes at 27% below 10-year averages. Now that's better than the 34% to 35% that they were below 10-year averages for the first nine months last year. But there's no reason why we're not going to get back to 10-year average is a tailwind, but you can look at the performance in banking and markets, and that's one building block in the foundation for mid-teens returns. The second is our continued progress, which requires more time and more execution on our part around Asset and Wealth Management. And while we've improved the margins, we still have work to do on the margins and also the returns, and we continue to be very focused. But we are confident over the course of the next few years that we can bring the returns of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise into the mid-teens. The next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag associated with the platform business, that will get to a point where it basically becomes negligible. It's getting closer to that. And so, if you put those building blocks together, Global Banking and Markets, its actual performance with a little bit more of a tailwind, which obviously it benefits from continued progress on Asset and Wealth Management, that is our business, and we should be able to deliver those returns. We're focused on it. We have more work to do, but that is the path, and I think it's pretty clear. When you have leading market shares, our Global Banking & Markets franchise, you bounce around at different levels based on short-term activity, but what I'd say is if you step back and you look over the last five years, we took a step function up in our market share broadly across the plot. And so, from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see variability. But I still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position, and we're zealously focused on them. We're zealously focused on the top 150 clients, which obviously make a huge contribution to the markets business. We're obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there. And obviously, in a better M&A environment where there's more large cap M&A. You do see some movement in our market share. So that's a market share tailwind for us. They've always been competitive business, Christian. Again, we think we're very well positioned with our clients and have deep trusting long-term relationships and through our one Goldman Sachs operating ethos, a history of delivering for them through the cycle. There's always going to be competition, but we like the way our business is positioned. And I don't see anything that fundamentally changes that, but have operated in these businesses. We've operated in these businesses for a long time. There are always going to be competitive businesses. Sure, I'll start. I don't know Denis might have something to add. But at a high level, this is a strategic decision that we have this big ultra-high net worth platform, and we were underinvested in lending to those clients. And there's a lot of historical reasons for why that's the case, starting with the fact that 15 years ago, we want a bank. And so, we really didn't look at the world that way. But lending into an ultra-high net worth franchise is a very good business, and it's a very important part of the business. And we understand that we've learned and we've seen it through investment banking, and we've seen it through market that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your client, including lending, you improve your market share position. So, when you look at our wealth franchise versus under other wealth franchises, we've been underpenetrated the lending to those wealth clients and we put in place resources a leadership team on a focused effort to increase that activity to these clients. While we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like JPMorgan, and I would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability for our clients. And Denis I don't know if there's anything you want to add on that? Yes. Thanks, Mike. I mean I know there's a lot of focus on that. I think we've been pretty clear in our messaging that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint. I don't have a lot more to say about where we are with Apple Card other than we're running it and improving it. And that's really all that I have to say. But I think the direction of travel at this point is pretty clear. I mean, one, I think there are long-term secular trends around M&A and market cap, which, by the way, are also meaningfully below trend I think that's more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact that there has not been a lot of large-cap M&A with the market cap expansion, especially around TAP, that might be permanent. It might not, but my guess is that will ebb and flow from time to time. But your sponsor point, Mike, is a very, very good point. And the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to turn on than I would have expected, but they will turn on. By the way, if that -- all that dry powder is deployed okay, M&A volumes versus the 10-year averages will go up. But by the way, if we were sitting here five years ago, 10-year average was lower five years ago than it is today because the 10-year average is definitely correlated to market cap growth and economic growth. So, I do think we'll operate a 10-year averages. I do think over time, by the end of the decade, the 10-year average will actually be higher that it's been with a historical lens. But I will say at the point lower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity. Some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we've highlighted. And I do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next 6, 12, 24 months. So, thanks for the question, Brennan. I mean there's no question equity activity picked up. But as I highlighted a few moments ago, volumes are still running 25% below 10-year averages. And IPOs running even more significantly below 10-year averages. I do think the sponsors, again, some of it is sponsor monetization. And because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher, they've been slow and they're kind of waiting for growth to bring up some of the values. But I do see an acceleration of activity and I expect it to continue, and there's no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldn't run a 10-year averages. And that those averages will grow over time with a growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of sponsored capital. Sure. We have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a one GS way, to some degree, on a differentiated way than many of the people we compete with. We obviously, as a credit originator in our investment banking business are one of the leading credit originators is not a leading position in leveraged loans and high-yield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that, we obviously, we originate and distribute. We also in our Asset & Management business, we are a leading player in private credit with $140 billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that. I think one of the things that's interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the street, there is plenty of capital that is interesting in deploying into private credit. The valuable part of the ecosystem is origination channels. And there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting origination channels and paltforms. But I would say when you look across Goldman Sachs, our origination ecosystem across both our Global Banking & Networks business and also in our Asset & Wealth Management business, is unique and differentiated and something that I think will continue to differentiate the firm as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform. So, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think one of the things that's interesting about this is, this gets framed in very binary ways. And obviously, private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things. It certainly refers to a lot of investment-grade lending, a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets. It can refer to direct lending in the below investment-grade business, which, by the way, is a component of our syndication activity and origination activity, particularly with sponsors. It can be direct lending for small and medium-sized enterprises. So, there's a wide range of things. When I listened to your question, when I pull away as you're asking in particular about leverage finance activity and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital. And I'd say they don't go in through the bias, they're actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution. And I think that one of the things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite distribute. We have an ability to direct lend. We have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs and their might needs might be different in different transactional situation. So, we like our positioning there. I do say that I believe from a secular perspective, there will be continued growth in private credit, particularly in the leveraged finance space.

And it's actually quite a broad and complicated space."

            "name": "Denis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $8.40 up 54% year-over-year. ROE was 10.4% and ROTE of 11.1%. As David mentioned, our results were impacted by select items, including agreements to transition the GM card platform and to sell our portfolio of seller financing norms. In aggregate, these items reduced EPS by $0.62 and our ROE by 80 basis points. Now turning to performance by segment starting on Page 4. Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $875 million were up both sequentially and versus the prior year period. We remain number one in the league tables for announced and completed M&A for the year to date. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year over year to $385 million. As equity capital markets have continued to reopen, though volumes are still well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 46% year over year to 605 million amid higher leverage finance and investment grade activity. We are seeing increased client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Overall, our investment banking backlog rose quarter on quarter driven by advisory. FIC net revenues of $3 billion in the quarter were down from a strong performance last year amid a relatively quieter summer, though we saw a meaningful pickup in activity in September. A decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record FIC financing revenues of $949 million, which rose 30% year over year, primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion dollars in the quarter up 18% versus the prior year. Equities intermediation revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29% year over year, primarily driven by strong performance across derivatives and cash products. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion rose versus the prior year amid higher average balances. Across FIC and equities financing revenues were a record $6.6 billion for the year to date. A direct result of the successful execution on our strategic priority to improve the durability of our revenue base. Moving to Asset and Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 16% year over year. Our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.4 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.6 billion for the quarter and $7.6 billion for the year to-date well on the way to achieving our $10 billion annual target for 2024. Private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to 756 million. We are seeing positive momentum in this business, and we remain focused on increasing lending penetration and expanding our loan product offerings. Incentive fees for the quarter were $85 million. We continue to expect to reach our annual target of $1 billion over the medium term, supported by approximately $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of the last quarter. Equity and debt investments revenues totaled $294 million reflecting NII in our debt portfolio and markups in our public equity portfolio. For the year to date, we generated one and a half billion in combined equity and debt investments revenues. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $3.1 trillion, bolstered by $37 billion of liquidity products net inflows, and $29 billion of long-term net inflows across asset classes. We continue to see traction in our solutions business where we are leveraging our SMA capabilities and outsource CIO platform to deliver customized multi-asset solutions. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $328 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $527 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $16 billion in the third quarter and over $50 billion for the year-to-date. This brings cumulative third-party fundraising to more than $300 billion since our Investor Day in 2020. We further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.7 billion in the third quarter to $10.9 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $5.4 billion. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income was $2.6 billion in the quarter up versus the prior year period, reflecting an increase in interest earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $192 billion up year-over-year, driven by an increase in other collateralized lending. For the third quarter, our provision for credit losses was $397 million, primarily driven by net charge offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by $70 million of net recoveries on previously impaired wholesale loans. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.3 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.2 billion down 14% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the firm, given ongoing inflationary pressures, competition for talent, and our desire to invest in our engineering and technology platforms. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.6%. For the full year, we continued to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on Slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $2 billion to common shareholders, including dividends of 978 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.6% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve reduced our SEB requirement by 20 basis points to 6.2%, following a successful appeal process, resulting in a standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio requirement of 13.7%, which became effective October 1st. We remain very engaged with our regulators on creating a less volatile and more transparent process. Given our 90-basis point buffer, we continue to have flexibility on capital deployment and are very well positioned to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders. In conclusion, our overall performance reflected the strength of our client franchise and the improving operating environment. We are executing on our strategy where we are maintaining and strengthening our leadership positions across Global Banking and Markets and leaning into secular growth opportunities in Asset and Wealth Management. Across both businesses, we are making strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams. Simply put, we are playing to our strengths as a firm and we remain confident in our ability to drive returns for shareholders while continuing to support our clients. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. Glenn, its Denis. I guess what I would suggest you take a look at, we have obviously a commitment to reducing the balance of the historical principal investments. As we continue to have success doing that, there will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved off of the balance sheet. But you will still see revenue generation associated with some of the co-invest positions that we retain as a piece of driving our overall growth of our third party fund management business as to guidance on future projected returns on that portfolio, I don't think I have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns, but I would suggest to you that we have a very diversified portfolio of exposures and a long standing track record of delivering good returns for our clients. The only thing I'd amplify, which I think we've mentioned before, we feel like we've run this play before. So, we worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of services we provided them, improved our market share position with those clients. We've implemented the same thing across the GBM public businesses of FICC and equities. We stand underpenetrated relative to peers today, and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to the clients in the wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with those clients. As David said, we are allocating incremental resources, more specialist capabilities and giving our advisers the confidence to offer a competitive product to their clients to improve the overall relationship they have with their clients. Sure, Betsy. Very good question. So generally speaking, the density of the HPI that we have left to sell down is high and the density asset and wealth loans is low. So, migrating RWA towards the lending businesses improves the durability, the predictability, the recurring nature of it, it brings forth the holistic access to the clients, all their wealth management needs and it is more capital efficient for us. So that is an underpinning component of the strategy as well. Sure, Betsy. So, in terms of timing, it's signed but not closed. There has to be a conversion to the new issuer and then ultimately at closing of the platform transfer expectations we're targeting Q3 of 2025. So that's sort of timing from a modeling perspective. And I guess what I would tell you, we obviously have responsibility for operating the platform until that point in time. So, we will continue to incur call it, the run rate operating losses associated with that business. As a guide, I'd point you to where we were in Q1 and Q2 of this year, something on the order of negative $50 million or $60 million per quarter, just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here until closing. Sure. I think the 80-basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items, which we have identified as the selected items, which we have announced, we are in the process of disposing of. Obviously, if we complete -- if we were to completely exit all consumer-related activities, there would be more associated capital relief potential. And we can obviously across the AWM franchise moved down the vast majority of the HPI exposure, that currently has a little over $4 billion of attributed equity associated with it. So, you have the dynamic of sort of reducing the P&L components. And then over time, we will remove the capital. So, removing the capital associated with HPI and then ultimately moving the capital associated with the consumer businesses that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time. Our capital deployment philosophy unchanged. I think if you take some of our comments in the prepared remarks about the outlook that we have, some of the engagement we're seeing from clients, potential opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition financing, that is an activity that's very core to Goldman Sachs. We have a historical leading market share position there given netting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities. And so that would be an attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across wealth and the financing business and public is an attractive place to deploy capital. And that is our priority as we sit here today with our 90 basis point buffer heading into the fourth quarter. But we also remain very committed, as we've said before, to sustainably growing our dividend. That's a core part of our philosophy. And we do believe it's important to also continue to return capital to shareholders. We do have a higher valuation. We do think about that. We are sensitive to that, but I don't believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldn't be also returning capital to shareholders. Sure. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Obviously, we put that disclosure out there, so you can track it and follow it over time. It's obviously very much mix dependent in terms of the nature of the particular at assets that are coming in thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our asset management franchise, an important to a lot of our investment in our clients are the services we provide through our OCIO offerings. But in certain of those portfolios, we do bring on board some Alts assets and the effective fee associated with that is lower than paid Goldman Sachs fund generated alternative fee. So, we have a multichannel asset accumulation strategy that we're deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business. And for us, having scale is an important contributor, ultimately, to driving margins, efficiencies and returns in the business, but not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee. So, you may see some slight variation in that over time. Sure. Thanks for the question. I mean we look at equity and then frankly, even FICC trading activities, the strategy facing clients is multichannel again. So, we have voice. We have high-touch voice, and we have electronic, and increasingly, we're finding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients. So, we have both, call it, run rate, more plain vanilla intermediation activities. Now we have the capacity to either take on board more interesting structure or complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process. and the approach is to have a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses. So, the $4 billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying, completing harvesting and migrating their way to the end to their investment cycle. Given a lot of the other commentary that we've been discussing about level of activity, strategically, openness of capital markets, in particular, equity capital markets, sponsor monetization activity, et cetera, as it relates to our portfolio where we own some balance sheet investments, and we own investments in funds, we have not had as much monetization in line with where the market has been generally. So as activity improves, we will also see more monetization and we expect that over the next several years, we will move towards those medium-term targets of a run rate, $1 billion worth of incentive fees. But I can't tell you exactly the rates that comes in, that will be dependent on how ultimately these funds harvest and when we're in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive fees. Sure. So, I think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisers needs to be a strategic and sustained investment program. So rather than having it a sort of ebb and flow across different market environments or based on what the firm's perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at different years in the past. I think part of the strategy of investing in what is a really outstanding business at Goldman Sachs, where we're the premier ultra-high net worth firm, we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisers over multiple years. And so that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how we're looking to invest in that business. And when David makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across AWM and that we are focused not just on margins and returns, but investing to grow. One of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow is actually in the adviser footprint. I mean the only thing I'd add, Gerard, if you just think about it, I think David has laid this out really well. If you think about where Goldman Sachs is positioned against this opportunity set. We have capacity to lend to alternative clients, for example, who are deploying into the private credit space. We have the capacity to underwrite and distribute different types of investment-grade and noninvestment-grade capital structures and we have the capacity to offer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposed to the asset class. And while we compete with all of those different parties that David enumerated, I'm hard-pressed to find many people that have the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us. So we really like our position in terms of the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum. Sure. Thank you, Saul. So obviously, we've just arrived at our mid-20s target. I think it's important that we consolidate our position there. We think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as we scale top line, as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform, and we look to drive other operating efficiencies across the business segment. There are plenty of competitors that have margins as you cite, that are 30% or higher. So, our commitment is to continue to improve the margins. But we're also thinking increasingly about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the long term. So, we are going to try and find the balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long-term value in this segment. But for the time being, we think that both can be achieved. Okay. Thank you. Look, what I would say for the last period of quarters and years, we've been operating in an environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty. There's also been operating uncertainty as well. I think the economic trajectory, outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus frankly, that presents opportunities. So, we run a buffer so that we have pent-up capacity to support incoming client opportunities. But we also run the buffer given other uncertainties in the world, which include regulatory. As to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital position, I couldn't tell you right now. But we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we get that regulatory feedback. From everything we know, there are generally time lines associated with those rules coming into effect. And we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be prepared for other unexpected developments, including regulatory."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, July 15th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. We are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured. It is a sad moment for our country. There is no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come together and to treat one another with respect, civility, dignity, especially when we disagree. We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrate, that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society. Turning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. We delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the first-half of the year. We continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing number one rank in announcement completed M&A and ranked number two in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog is up significantly this quarter. From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A recovery. And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well positioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in activity. We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FIC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and financing needs. We continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 118 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees in private, banking, and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter. Our Assets Under Supervision had a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. We delivered a 23% margin for the first-half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of AWM. In alternatives, we raised $36 billion a year-to-date. We completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter, including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies, and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies. Given the stronger-than-anticipated fundraising in the first-half of the year, as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year. This is a testament to our investment performance, track record, and intense focus on client experience. We are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset growth management platform. Let me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there is a high level of geopolitical instability. Elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policy. And inflation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated. On the other hand the environment in the U.S. remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all-time highs. I am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Recently, our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon Valley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting edge of technology and AI. We all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovation in technology more broadly. The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it significant demand-related infrastructure and financing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise. Before I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results. The year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests. Given this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well positioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with our capital. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter. We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend which underscores our confidence in the durability of our franchise. Since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit in the second quarter, our 25th anniversary as a public company. We went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the firm, and it's been an eventful 25-years since then. We have persevered through a number of significant global events, including through the dotcom bubble, NASDAQ crash, September 11th, the financial crisis, and the pandemic. When I look back at how we overcame these challenges, immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stayed true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people. In closing, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise. We are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results in more detail.\nDennis Coleman: Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 11.6%. Now turning to performance by segment starting on page four. Global banking and markets produce revenues of $8.2 billion in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the prior year period. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $423 million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen. No volumes remain well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leverage finance activity. We are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Our backlog rose significantly quarter-on-quarter, driven by both advisory and debt underwriting. FIC net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Intermediation results rose on better performance in rates and currencies. FIC financing revenues were $850 million, a near record, and up 37% year-over-year. Equity's net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter up 7% year-on-year as higher intermediation results were helped by better performance in derivatives. Equity's financing revenues were $1.4 billion, down modestly from a record performance last year, but up 5% sequentially. Taken together, financing revenues were a record $2.2 billion for the second quarter and a record $4.4 billion for the first-half of the year. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both FIC and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base. I'm moving to asset wealth management on page five. Revenues of $3.9 billion were up 27% year-over-year. As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707million. Our premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products. A great example of the power of this unique platform. We expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint. Our pre-tax margin for the first-half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid-20s medium term target. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $2.9 trillion, supported by $31 billion of long-term net inflows, largely from our OCIO business, representing our 26th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $314 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $548 million in management and other fees. Rose third-party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36 billion for the first-half of the year. In the second quarter, we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion. On page nine, firmwide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter, up sequentially from an increase in higher yielding assets and a shift towards non-interest bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $282 million, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly $115 million related to our wholesale portfolio. Turning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, and included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our effective tax rate for the first-half of 2024 was 21.6%. For the full-year, we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on slide 11. In the quarter we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher than expected SCB requirement, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter. We will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement. Our board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter, a reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our confidence in the increasing durability of our franchise. In conclusion, we generated solid returns for the first-half of 2024, which reflects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy. We made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams, including record first-half revenues across FIC and equities financing, management and other fees, and private banking and lending. We remain confident in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by as we assemble the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi there. Thanks very much. So I liked your forward leaning comments on the IBC pipeline and I think I heard you say the demand for committed acquisition financing is high. Does that infer anything about us being any closer to an inflection point in private equity related M&A, sponsor related M&A? And then how much of an [Technical Difficulty] think you have as being maybe the big -- the only big bank that has a full on private credit platform, obviously DCM platform and lending platform? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Sure, good morning Glenn, and thanks for the question. You know, we're forward leaning in our comments, because we definitely see momentum pick up. But I just, again, want to highlight something that was definitely my part of the script. And I think Dennis amplified, which were still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still significantly below 10-year averages. And so for example, I think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on M&A. One of the reasons that M&A activity, one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why M&A activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. And so I think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025 kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity. We're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. And obviously, it's been way, way below the overall M&A activity as kind of another 20% to get to 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that and we're starting to see that increase. Now, as that increases, I just think the firm's incredibly well positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. We've been top kind of one, two, three in what I'll call leverage-financed activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community, but we combine it with a very, very powerful direct lending private credit platform. And so I just think we're in a very, very interesting position. The size and the scope of the companies that are out there that have to be refinanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds, you know, to their limited partners, I think bodes well over the course of the next three to five years. Different environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last two, 2.5 years.\nGlenn Schorr: I appreciate that. Maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, in your printed prepared remarks, that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter? Can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during the quarter? Thanks.\nDennis Coleman: Sure, Glenn. It's Dennis. I think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. And the results that reflect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. So that is, I think, a large explain of the delta.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I just wanted to spend some time on capital, the post, the SCB increase. One, maybe just from a business standpoint, if you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the firm has been leaning into the financing business. Do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual? So one, how does it impact the business? And second, Dennis, your comments on buybacks moderating, should we think more like 1Q levels of buybacks going forward? Thanks.\nDennis Coleman: Sure, Ibrahim. So a couple of comments. I guess first important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. So we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter, which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise. And with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly, there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition financing as David was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses. We have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders. Given the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter, we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital flexibility. And based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buffer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. So assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the financing business. And just separately in terms of sponsor-led activity, we waited all year for things to pick up. Is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets? Does it speak to inflated valuations that they're carrying these assets on? Just would love any context there, David, if you could? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I mean, I appreciate that. I don't think it's troubling. I wouldn't use the word troubling. But I do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. At the same point, there's pressure from LPs to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds. And as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. And so I think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. But I just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. I'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly, but we are going to go back to more normalized levels.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, can you hear me okay? Oh, okay. Sorry, [Multiple Speakers] All right. Well, thanks very much. I did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the expense line as we're going through this environment because, we've had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit, but I'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? Or is this just a one-off given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Betsy. So if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and benefit expense. We are sort of following the same protocol that we always do which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reflects the performance of the firm, as well as the overall competitive market for talent. So based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay and as we anticipate a continued pick up here in M&A, given everything you mentioned earlier, I would think that, that's positive operating leverage that should be coming your way. Would you agree with that or do I have something wrong there? Thanks.\nDennis Coleman: No, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. And we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations.\nBetsy Graseck: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged, Dennis, the record financing revenue, which clearly shows momentum behind the business. And it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now, it seems to reflect balance growth. So one, I want to confirm that that's fair? And could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon?\nDennis Coleman: Sure. Thank you, Brendan. So we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. We have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. We have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products. The business is very diversified by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. We've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. That's something that we're going to remain mindful of. But we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. And then next question is really sort of a follow on from Betsy's line of questioning. So year-to-date you've got a 64% efficiency ratio. You know, when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment, consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily, you know, how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue? You know, could you help us understand how revenue growth will continue to drive improvement in that efficiency ratio?\nDennis Coleman: Sure. So, thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. Obviously, our year-to-date efficiency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. Still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. As we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efficiency. But ultimately, the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor. But we do have visibility, for example, as we continue to move out of some of our CIE exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that. And we do have a very granular process internally, looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top line revenues.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. I mean, you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth and asset management. You have record financing for equities and FIC combined. You're number one in M&A. You have record management fees and record assets under supervision. Your efficiency has gone from 74% to 64%. Increase your dividend by 9% to signal your confidence, your CET1 ratios, 90 basis points above even the higher Fed requirements. David, you start off the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 11% ROE in the second quarter, that's not quite the 15% where you want it to be. So where's the disconnect from what you're generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Yes, thanks Mike. Appreciate the question. Look, we're on a journey. And, you know, the way I look at it, our returns for the first-half of the year at 12.8%. There are, you know, I think there are a couple of things, give gets in that. One, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through. And so that will come out. And at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the first-half of the year would be a little higher exit. And then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity. And I think that'll come back. I obviously can't predict. But if you look at the returns of the firm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm. And we're going to continue to focus on that. Now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in AWM. So you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the AWM, ROE is not where it needs to be. You heard our comments about the fact that we've gotten the margin up to 23%, but the ROE is still around 10%. We think we can continue to grow the business. As we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that AWM, ROE. And then you look across the firm and you have a stronger return profile. So I think we're making good progress. We didn't say and have not worked to do for sure. But we feel good about the progress.\nMike Mayo: And I assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier effect when mergers really kick in. Can you just describe what that multiplier effect could potentially look like based on pass cycles?\nDavid Solomon: What I would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. I'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously, if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that. But as a general matter, when there are more M&A transactions, whether with financial sponsors or big corporates, there is more financing attached to that. People need to raise capital to finance those transactions. They need to reposition balance sheets. They need to manage risks through structured transactions. And so there's a multiplier effect as those activities increase. We don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the M&A side.\nMike Mayo: And then lastly, for your returns, the denominator is a big factor. How does that work with the Fed? I know you can't say too much and regional people can disagree, but your whole point is that you've de-risked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the Fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. So how does this process work from here? Will we hear results about the SEB ahead, or is this something that's just behind closed doors?\nDavid Solomon: Look, as a general matter, what I'd say, Mike, as a general matter, we're supporters of stress testing. We believe it's an important component of the Fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. However, we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. The stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. It lacks transparency. It contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buffer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers. We don't believe that the results reflect the significant changes we've made in our business. They're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year-over-year. Now, despite all that, you know, we've got the capital flexibility to serve our clients. We'll continue to work with that capital flexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. But obviously we have more work to do given this result.\nMike Mayo: All right, thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question. Just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. They were down only modestly despite the absence of the Green Sky contribution. Just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping off point as we look at the next quarter?\nDennis Coleman: So, Steve, thank you for the question. I mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the Green Sky contribution. There actually is growth across the card portfolio. I think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.\nSteven Chubak: Understood and maybe just one more clarifying question. I know there's been a lot asked about the SEB. Really just wanted to better understand, Dennis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is actually above normal. Just how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to Basel III endgame. There's certainly been some favorable momentum per the press reports and even some public comments from regulators? But just want to better understand, given the uncertainty around both the SEB and Basel III endgame, where you're comfortable running on a CET1 basis over the near to medium term?\nDennis Coleman: Sure, thanks and I appreciate that question. I think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. And I think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal flexibility. And certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to Basel III endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution. It sounds from some of Powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into effect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs, but that buffer is designed to support clients return capital shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input.\nSteven Chubak: Helpful color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDennis Coleman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan: All right, great. Good morning, David and Dennis. A couple questions on AWM progress. So the first one is on the alts business specifically, and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the $1 billion medium term target for annual incentive fees? And now with over $500 billion in alts AUM and obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative. So I appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here, but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment, just given the mixed shift and the growth that you're seeing in AUM there?\nDennis Coleman: So Devin, I think it's a good question, and I think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. We laid it out as one of the building blocks at our Investor Day. The contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective. We do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously you know bounce around from time-to-time it is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years. So I think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know, should help the return profile of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures.\nDevin Ryan: Yes, okay, thanks, Dennis. And then follow-up, this is also kind of connected, but at a recent conference, you highlighted the margin profile of all the standalone businesses and asset and wealth management of public peers so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35% plus for alts and some of the public firms we know are obviously well above that. So I appreciate you're running the AWM segment is kind of one segment, but if alts does accelerate and we're looking at 60% of alts AUM isn't even the fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target, because you're already at 23% thus far in \u201824. So just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth, particularly from the alts segment as well?\nDennis Coleman: So that's a good question, Devin. I mean, it should be a significant unlock for us, because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is significant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall AWM margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy. And so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks, good morning. In terms of your on-balance sheet investments, you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter. Can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about?\nDennis Coleman: Sure. Thank you. Obviously, an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter, that was a decent reduction. We obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year. But our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. There's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year.\nDan Fannon: Understood. And as a follow-up, just within asset and wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target raised for the full-year given the success you've had. The private credit fund closing here in the first-half was big. Can you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large or increasing momentum as you think about second-half, but also as we even into next year?\nDennis Coleman: Sure. So, you know, obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know, once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. It's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the first-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year. And I think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity, credit, real estate, infrastructure. We had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter, but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of different strategies, both by asset class and by region. So we think we have a diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape specifically in banking and markets. I know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers, you know, are leaning in who haven't been a few years ago. And all these regional banks that I cover are also realizing that they need broader cap and market capabilities. So you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets. And I'm just wondering how you're seeing the competition impact you at this point?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, Matt, and I appreciate the question. I just say, you know, investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. I think our integrated One GS approach is a very, very competitive offering. I mean, we can have debates, but it's, I think, one of the top two offerings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at. There's always going to be competition there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading M&A share for 25-years. We have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. We've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. An then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk I think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time. And so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and financial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions is very well. They'll always be competitors, but I like where our franchise sits. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay helpful, it's unagreed. And then just separately, I hate to ask you about activity levels and stuff like that since the debate three, four weeks ago, but maybe I'll frame it. From your experience in presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like how do both institutional and corporate clients react? Do they kind of say, well, let's wait and see the other side? Is it just noise, because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: There are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity. I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but I think we're well positioned to serve our clients, regardless of the environment. And clients are very active at the moment, and I think they're probably going to continue to be active.\nMatt O'Connor: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, David. Good morning, Dennis. David, you said in your opening comments that you took the board out to Silicon Valley and you were impressed with the artificial intelligence and what we could expect in the future and the opportunities for Goldman to be able to finance some of the infrastructure needs that may come of that? Can you share with us the artificial intelligence that you guys are implementing within Goldman and how it's making you more productive, generating maybe greater revenues or even making it more efficient?\nDavid Solomon: Sure, I mean, at a high level, Gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity. And if you think about our business as a professional service firm, a people business, where we have lots of very, very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very, very powerful tool. So, you know we you know if you look and you think across the scale of our business I think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious. You can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter. You're all analysts on the phone. There's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. You think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what I'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there. When you look at the data sets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. For our engineering stack and we have close to 11,000 engineers inside the firm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful. So those are a handful. There are others. We have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. But again, I'd step back. Well, this will increase our productivity. The thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. And that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. People will need to make investment, they'll need financing, they'll need to scale. And so we're excited about that broad opportunity.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, Dennis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing there? It seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didn't have any charge-offs in the wholesale book?\nDennis Coleman: Sure. Thanks, Gerard. As you observe, the charge-off rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. What we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment. So while that was a contributing benefit to sort of call it the net PCL of the quarter with consumer charge-offs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future. And although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very, very diligently and consistently, it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business. But we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge-offs is about 0%.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Saul Martinez with HSBC.\nSaul Martinez: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on capital, I mean, it certainly is encouraging that your CET1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you did have a -- I think, a $16 billion reduction in RWA as your presentation talks about credit RWA is falling this quarter? I guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? And I guess more importantly, is there continued room for RWA optimization from here to help manage your capital levels?\nDennis Coleman: Sure, thanks, Saul. I appreciate that question. Capital optimization, RWA optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. On the quarter, there were reductions both in credit and market risk RWAs. Drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure and in some places lower levels of volatility. We try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity, as well as being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. So that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter benefit despite the buyback activity we executed. And it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under.\nSaul Martinez: Thank you, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-up on financing, FIC financing up 37% equities, the equity financing, now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. I guess how much more room is there, or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set, you know, to continue to grow from here? How much more space is there, you know, to use finding a thing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients?\nDennis Coleman: That's a good question, Saul. I think on the FIC financing side, as I indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. And you know, we think based on what we see currently, that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunities that across the client portfolio. So we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the GBM business. In equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have benefited from equity market inflation over the course of the year, but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients. And clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both FIC and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're finding some balance between helping them through financing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. So both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow.\nSaul Martinez: Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time there are no additional questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dennis Coleman",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the second quarter, we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 11.6%. Now turning to performance by segment starting on page four. Global banking and markets produce revenues of $8.2 billion in the second quarter, up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the prior year period. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $423 million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen. No volumes remain well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leverage finance activity. We are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Our backlog rose significantly quarter-on-quarter, driven by both advisory and debt underwriting. FIC net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. Intermediation results rose on better performance in rates and currencies. FIC financing revenues were $850 million, a near record, and up 37% year-over-year. Equity's net revenues were $3.2 billion in the quarter up 7% year-on-year as higher intermediation results were helped by better performance in derivatives. Equity's financing revenues were $1.4 billion, down modestly from a record performance last year, but up 5% sequentially. Taken together, financing revenues were a record $2.2 billion for the second quarter and a record $4.4 billion for the first-half of the year. Our strategic priority to grow financing across both FIC and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base. I'm moving to asset wealth management on page five. Revenues of $3.9 billion were up 27% year-over-year. As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707million. Our premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products. A great example of the power of this unique platform. We expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint. Our pre-tax margin for the first-half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid-20s medium term target. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $2.9 trillion, supported by $31 billion of long-term net inflows, largely from our OCIO business, representing our 26th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $314 billion at the end of the second quarter, driving $548 million in management and other fees. Rose third-party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36 billion for the first-half of the year. In the second quarter, we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion. On page nine, firmwide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter, up sequentially from an increase in higher yielding assets and a shift towards non-interest bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, flat versus the prior quarter. For the second quarter, our provision for credit losses was $282 million, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by a release of roughly $115 million related to our wholesale portfolio. Turning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, and included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our effective tax rate for the first-half of 2024 was 21.6%. For the full-year, we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on slide 11. In the quarter we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher than expected SCB requirement, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter. We will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buffer above our new requirement. Our board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter, a reflection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our confidence in the increasing durability of our franchise. In conclusion, we generated solid returns for the first-half of 2024, which reflects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy. We made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams, including record first-half revenues across FIC and equities financing, management and other fees, and private banking and lending. We remain confident in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Sure, Glenn. It's Dennis. I think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had significant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. And the results that reflect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. So that is, I think, a large explain of the delta. Sure, Ibrahim. So a couple of comments. I guess first important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. So we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter, which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise. And with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up significantly, there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition financing as David was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the financing businesses. We have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders. Given the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter, we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital flexibility. And based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buffer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders. No, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. And we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations. Sure. Thank you, Brendan. So we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. We have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. We have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products. The business is very diversified by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. We've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. That's something that we're going to remain mindful of. But we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate. Sure. So, thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. Obviously, our year-to-date efficiency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. Still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. As we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efficiency. But ultimately, the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor. But we do have visibility, for example, as we continue to move out of some of our CIE exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that. And we do have a very granular process internally, looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efficiencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top line revenues. So, Steve, thank you for the question. I mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the Green Sky contribution. There actually is growth across the card portfolio. I think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted. Sure, thanks and I appreciate that question. I think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. And I think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal flexibility. And certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to Basel III endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution. It sounds from some of Powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into effect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs, but that buffer is designed to support clients return capital shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buffer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input. Thank you. So Devin, I think it's a good question, and I think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. We laid it out as one of the building blocks at our Investor Day. The contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective. We do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously you know bounce around from time-to-time it is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years. So I think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know, should help the return profile of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures. So that's a good question, Devin. I mean, it should be a significant unlock for us, because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is significant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin profile of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall AWM margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy. And so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution. Sure. Thank you. Obviously, an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter, that was a decent reduction. We obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year. But our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. There's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year. Sure. So, you know, obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know, once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. It's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the first-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year. And I think one of the things that we find attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity, credit, real estate, infrastructure. We had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter, but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of different strategies, both by asset class and by region. So we think we have a diversified opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform. Sure. Thanks, Gerard. As you observe, the charge-off rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. What we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment. So while that was a contributing benefit to sort of call it the net PCL of the quarter with consumer charge-offs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future. And although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very, very diligently and consistently, it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business. But we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge-offs is about 0%. Sure, thanks, Saul. I appreciate that question. Capital optimization, RWA optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. On the quarter, there were reductions both in credit and market risk RWAs. Drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure and in some places lower levels of volatility. We try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity, as well as being efficient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. So that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter benefit despite the buyback activity we executed. And it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under. That's a good question, Saul. I think on the FIC financing side, as I indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. And you know, we think based on what we see currently, that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunities that across the client portfolio. So we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the GBM business. In equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have benefited from equity market inflation over the course of the year, but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients. And clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both FIC and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're finding some balance between helping them through financing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. So both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow."

            "content": "Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. We are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured. It is a sad moment for our country. There is no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come together and to treat one another with respect, civility, dignity, especially when we disagree. We cannot afford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reflection and action that celebrate, that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society. Turning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. We delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the first-half of the year. We continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing number one rank in announcement completed M&A and ranked number two in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog is up significantly this quarter. From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A recovery. And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well positioned to benefit from a continued resurgence in activity. We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FIC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and financing needs. We continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 118 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees in private, banking, and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter. Our Assets Under Supervision had a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. We delivered a 23% margin for the first-half of the year and are making progress on improving the return profile of AWM. In alternatives, we raised $36 billion a year-to-date. We completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter, including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies, and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies. Given the stronger-than-anticipated fundraising in the first-half of the year, as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year. This is a testament to our investment performance, track record, and intense focus on client experience. We are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset growth management platform. Let me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there is a high level of geopolitical instability. Elections across the globe could have significant implications for forward policy. And inflation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated. On the other hand the environment in the U.S. remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all-time highs. I am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence. Recently, our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon Valley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting edge of technology and AI. We all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovation in technology more broadly. The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it significant demand-related infrastructure and financing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise. Before I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results. The year-over-year increase in our stress capital buffer does not seem to reflect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity, which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests. Given this discrepancy, we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well positioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with our capital. In the second quarter, we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the first quarter. We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend which underscores our confidence in the durability of our franchise. Since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reflect on the significant milestone we hit in the second quarter, our 25th anniversary as a public company. We went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the firm, and it's been an eventful 25-years since then. We have persevered through a number of significant global events, including through the dotcom bubble, NASDAQ crash, September 11th, the financial crisis, and the pandemic. When I look back at how we overcame these challenges, immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stayed true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people. In closing, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise. We are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths effectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results in more detail. Sure, good morning Glenn, and thanks for the question. You know, we're forward leaning in our comments, because we definitely see momentum pick up. But I just, again, want to highlight something that was definitely my part of the script. And I think Dennis amplified, which were still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still significantly below 10-year averages. And so for example, I think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on M&A. One of the reasons that M&A activity, one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why M&A activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. And so I think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025 kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity. We're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. And obviously, it's been way, way below the overall M&A activity as kind of another 20% to get to 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that and we're starting to see that increase. Now, as that increases, I just think the firm's incredibly well positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. We've been top kind of one, two, three in what I'll call leverage-financed activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community, but we combine it with a very, very powerful direct lending private credit platform. And so I just think we're in a very, very interesting position. The size and the scope of the companies that are out there that have to be refinanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds, you know, to their limited partners, I think bodes well over the course of the next three to five years. Different environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last two, 2.5 years. Sure. I mean, I appreciate that. I don't think it's troubling. I wouldn't use the word troubling. But I do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. At the same point, there's pressure from LPs to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds. And as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. And so I think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. But I just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. I'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly, but we are going to go back to more normalized levels. Good morning, Betsy. Sure, Betsy. So if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and benefit expense. We are sort of following the same protocol that we always do which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reflects the performance of the firm, as well as the overall competitive market for talent. So based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves. Yes, thanks Mike. Appreciate the question. Look, we're on a journey. And, you know, the way I look at it, our returns for the first-half of the year at 12.8%. There are, you know, I think there are a couple of things, give gets in that. One, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through. And so that will come out. And at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the first-half of the year would be a little higher exit. And then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity. And I think that'll come back. I obviously can't predict. But if you look at the returns of the firm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the firm. And we're going to continue to focus on that. Now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in AWM. So you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the AWM, ROE is not where it needs to be. You heard our comments about the fact that we've gotten the margin up to 23%, but the ROE is still around 10%. We think we can continue to grow the business. As we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that AWM, ROE. And then you look across the firm and you have a stronger return profile. So I think we're making good progress. We didn't say and have not worked to do for sure. But we feel good about the progress. What I would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. I'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously, if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that. But as a general matter, when there are more M&A transactions, whether with financial sponsors or big corporates, there is more financing attached to that. People need to raise capital to finance those transactions. They need to reposition balance sheets. They need to manage risks through structured transactions. And so there's a multiplier effect as those activities increase. We don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the M&A side. Look, as a general matter, what I'd say, Mike, as a general matter, we're supporters of stress testing. We believe it's an important component of the Fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. However, we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. The stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. It lacks transparency. It contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buffer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difficult for us and all of our peers. We don't believe that the results reflect the significant changes we've made in our business. They're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year-over-year. Now, despite all that, you know, we've got the capital flexibility to serve our clients. We'll continue to work with that capital flexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. But obviously we have more work to do given this result. Sure, Matt, and I appreciate the question. I just say, you know, investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. I think our integrated One GS approach is a very, very competitive offering. I mean, we can have debates, but it's, I think, one of the top two offerings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at. There's always going to be competition there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading M&A share for 25-years. We have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. We've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. An then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk I think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time. And so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and financial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions is very well. They'll always be competitors, but I like where our franchise sits. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business. There are always exogenous factors that affect corporate activity and institutional client activity. I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but I think we're well positioned to serve our clients, regardless of the environment. And clients are very active at the moment, and I think they're probably going to continue to be active. Sure, I mean, at a high level, Gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity. And if you think about our business as a professional service firm, a people business, where we have lots of very, very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very, very powerful tool. So, you know we you know if you look and you think across the scale of our business I think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious. You can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter. You're all analysts on the phone. There's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. You think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what I'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there. When you look at the data sets we have across the firm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. For our engineering stack and we have close to 11,000 engineers inside the firm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful. So those are a handful. There are others. We have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. But again, I'd step back. Well, this will increase our productivity. The thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. And that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. People will need to make investment, they'll need financing, they'll need to scale. And so we're excited about that broad opportunity."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs' First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without consent. This call is being recorded today, April 15th, 2024. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial Officer, Dennis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.\nDavid Solomon: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We feel very good about our first quarter results, which reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our firm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter. As laid out in January, we have three strategic objectives, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class differentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at-scale. Across the firm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever. CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital, and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. Where we stand today, it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets, with the first few months of 2024 seen an reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit, and Rank is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing. In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. It's important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions. In Wealth Management, we saw significant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In Alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments despite a more difficult fundraising environment. And in Solutions, we continued -- we saw continued demand for our outsourced CIO and SMA offerings. These are all areas in which we still see significant opportunities and we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win. I also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation I have, Artificial Intelligence. While there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is an enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out, including the timeline for commercial impact, shape of potential regulations, impact on jobs, and where value will accrue in the ecosystem. Today, we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer-term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectations, there will be significant demand for AI-related infrastructure and as a result, financing, which will be a tailwind to our business. For our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We are focused on enhancing productivity, particularly for our developers, and increasing operating efficiency while maintaining a high bar for quality, security, and controls. Like with any emerging technology, a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial. Turning to the macro-environment, we continue to be constructive on the health of the US economy. The Fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I am also mindful that US equity markets are hovering near-record levels at a time when we see -- when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inflation, the commercial real estate market, and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth. But that said, the US economy has proven to be resilient, supported by a number of factors, including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration. So, while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain. Nonetheless, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people, and our culture of collaboration and excellence. Every day as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities, and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results for the quarter.\nDenis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $11.58, an ROE of 14.8%, and an ROTE of 15.9%. We provide details on the financial impact of selected items in the bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter. Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the first quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis. Turning to Page 4. Advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions. We remain number one in the league tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million, both rose significantly year-over-year amid an increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust. FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages, credit, and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to effectively make markets across a number of different geographies and asset classes. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time. Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially offset by lower financing spreads. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year. Record management and other fees were up 7% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder, we closed the sale of Personal Financial Management in November of last year, which contributed approximately $60 million in fees in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Based on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior year period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year in our private portfolio that was largely offset by a markdown on a large public position. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. We had $24 billion of long-term net inflows, largely in fixed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to Page 7, on Alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the quarter. We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in Alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year. More broadly, we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next five years. On-balance sheet Alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the first quarter, we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. We expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026 consistent with our target. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment profitability has improved with a pre-tax net loss of $117 million for the quarter. In line with our target, we expect to drive this business to pre-tax breakeven next year. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter, as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially offset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters. Turning to Page 10. We continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know, we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in AWM alternative equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at-risk related to CIEs. Turning to expenses on Page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reflecting improved operating performance for the firm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year, even inclusive of a $78 million FDIC special assessment charge, and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% and for the full year, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%. Now on to Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. We are currently running with a 170 basis point buffer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for significant modifications to the Basel III proposed rule, we should have materially more flexibility on capital deployment. We also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our leading global banking and markets franchise and our growing Asset & Wealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas for 2024 that we laid out in January, which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.\nGlenn Schorr: Hi. Thanks very much. It's a tough one because you are definitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out. And of course, the sustainability of banking is what it is. I noticed your lower pipeline. But the real question I have is, the sustainability of the whole package, meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything. Comp was up with that normally, but non-comp is down, the provision is down and RWA didn't increase even though you were growing your financing. So I'm giving you a softball here and just saying, what of that package can continue to stick?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I appreciate it, Glenn. And I think there are a bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know that we've been focused on is building a more durable business and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package. We've made significant progress over the course of the last five years. Certainly, building our financing business in our markets business is something that's more durable and more sustainable. We still think there's lots of room to grow. And look, the world is growing and when the world grows and our clients grow, they need us to finance them. We've got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base. And so we stay focused on that. We've doubled our management fees on our Asset & Wealth Management business over the last five years and we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. Those are more durable revenues. And there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. You've seen the margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like that business to have and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there. Overall, I think, we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very, very focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. And we've said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet shares sticky? I think the wallet shares are. What I can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these businesses and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where we're very well-positioned. And we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position.\nGlenn Schorr: I definitely appreciate all that. Can we talk just follow up on just the non-comp piece and talk -- you had some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuff. So are those at actually run-rate levels now going forward also because that was a nice positive surprise?\nDenis Coleman: Good morning, Glenn. It's Dennis. As we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very, very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. There clearly are inflationary pressures that impact a number of items in our non-comp expense. The sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. And so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very, very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. But I think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess I just wanted to follow up, David. You mentioned AI and would love this -- it's hard in our seats to figure out what's hype, what's real. If you can double-click on some of the comments you made around comparing what's going on with AI today versus maybe the dotcom bubble around the runway this might create for capital markets, IB, not just for this year, but beyond? And then also the other side around, is there line-of-sight of how much more efficient Goldman itself can get by deploying AI? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. So, I mean, big picture and look, I'm not a stock picker, so I'm not going to comment when you make a comparison to the Internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001, I'm not going to comment around that. I think we have -- we've got a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that I think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies. But broadly speaking, these technologies require certain things, including infrastructure, power, and these things require financing to drive the scale that's going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace. And that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that we've seen in the context of other areas of significant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time. So I actually think there's a very, very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses, and we're talking about a level of scale that is -- that is candidly unprecedented. And so I think that opportunity is something over the course, this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next five to 10 years and we're very, very focused on it and very engaged. And by the way, it's not just companies, it's governments, obviously that are making enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locale. And so all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on. Double-clicking and getting more narrowly focused on Goldman Sachs, I would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efficiency. Our use cases that we're testing and that we're implementing focus on those two areas. But I'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efficiency gain that becomes very cost accretive. I think one of the most important things for this firm and the success of this firm is the time our people spend with clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients, and these tools give us more productivity, and also when we look at our datasets and what we have internally and ability to deliver them a value-added package of information, thought process that we think can be differentiated. And so we're very focused on the productivity side, although, of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efficiency and we're also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's good color. Thank you. And just separately, for the Goldman stock, right, I think from an investor standpoint, a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of Asset Management. You've talked about the HPIs coming down, alt assets going up. Is -- how else should shareholders and prospective investors think about strategy around growing the Asset Management revenues and is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and in terms of how management is thinking about things today? Thank you.\nDavid Solomon: So we -- in January, we said to you, we thought high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. We're executing on that. We are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. Firm obviously generates a lot of capital. There could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. But at the moment, our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us and we are making good progress. But I think we put out a handful of metrics, both in terms of top-line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise, you saw that we highlighted $15 billion of fundraising in Alternatives in the first quarter. We said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this quarter -- this year. Obviously, the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year. That doesn't stop this year. We think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward. So we're focused on the things that matter in Asset Management. What matters? Performance matters, client experience matters. We're incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very -- very effectively.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\nChristian Bolu: Good morning, guys. Maybe I'll ask Glenn's question in a different way. If I look at that 18% ROE for the Global Bank and the Markets business, it really -- it really catches my eye here. So how would you characterize this quarter's performance? Is it like sort of normal-ish to you? Does it feel maybe peak-ish to you? Again just trying to figure out if 18% ROE is anywhere sustainable for that business.\nDavid Solomon: That was -- it was a -- it was -- there's no way to shade this. It was a strong quarter for Global Banking and Markets. Peak, I mean, I can point in the last few years to quarters in Global Banking and Markets where the returns were higher. But I certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in Global Banking and Markets. We've said clearly, we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. The performance this quarter was higher. There were performance last year was meaningfully lower. I think the right thing to focus on, Christian, is mid-teens through the cycle. That's the way we think about it. And there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter and I think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients, there is opportunity in the market. We're good at capturing that, delivering that for shareholders. And then when the environment is more tough though, this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at the past. But I would view this as a very strong quarter on Global Banking and Markets and not what we would target as the average run-rate for the business.\nChristian Bolu: Okay. That's very helpful. Maybe on to private wealth, if I'm reading Slide 9 correctly, you had something like $17 billion of inflows into Wealth Management AUS. So that would equate to something like 9% organic growth, which is well above peers, I would call it best-in-class. So can you give more color on what's driving that growth? Maybe any color by regions or products as to what's resonating with clients? And again, longer-term, how are you thinking about sustainability of that level of organic growth?\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Again, this I think comes down to focus and you know we made some very -- we talked about conscious decisions. We have talked about broadening our Wealth platform to get much more broadly into what I'd call kind of high net-worth Wealth Management. And with the sale of United Capital, we continue to be very focused on our ultra-high net-worth platform. It is an extraordinary platform. I do think it's a best-in-class platform. I do think that the ultra-high net-worth business is still a very fragmented business. While we have leading share, I think those shares are still on a global basis, a leader is a single-digit share. There's a lot of wealth in the world, there's a lot of wealth accumulating. But we are very, very well-positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. And I think the business is performing very, very well. So, our alts franchise, I think is differentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. I think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. We're expanding our private banking activity. That's not something that we have been focused on, which I think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager. So, I think there's a good runway for this business. I do think it's a best-in-class franchise that has room to grow. And I think you're seeing it perform well and we're very focused on it. I think the sharp decision around how we're going to focus this business, I think we're benefiting from at the moment.\nChristian Bolu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nDavid Solomon: Good morning, Betsy.\nDenis Coleman: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. All right. Great. Just want to make sure.\nDavid Solomon: We can hear you fine. Thank you.\nBetsy Graseck: All right. Thanks. So, just two follow-ups. One, I heard all the commentary about how the 1Q is run rate a little bit better than run rate on average over time. But it doesn't take away from the fact that 1Q was very strong. And I just wanted to understand, was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and fixed income, for example, that were different this quarter? And the reason I ask is, VaR efficiency was so strong, right? You've delivered very strong trading revenues on VaR that was, you know, basically flat Q-on-Q. I mean, a little down, a little up, depending on which asset -- which asset class you're looking at. So, was there anything in the -- in -- when you mentioned, you stepped into client activity and opportunity set, was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to do this in a way that didn't really tag VaR at all?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, Betsy, it's Denis. Nice to hear from you.\nBetsy Graseck: Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Look, to give you some color on that, I wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. I would say the revenue generation, the activity was broad-based. But in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes. And I would observe that over the course of the quarter, it was just a very benign operating environment. Credit spreads were tightening, equity valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our Global Banking and Markets business as well. The first quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. So we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. And as David said, that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter, particularly in FICC and Equities. So, when we talk about like a Global Banking and Markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance across both FICC and Equities in Q1.\nBetsy Graseck: Super. That's really helpful. Thanks for the incremental color there. Just one other follow-up. David, you mentioned you're able to deliver alts in a unique way to the Wealth platform that you've got. Could you just give us a little more color as to what you're thinking about there that we should understand? Thanks so much.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I think one of the things that our Wealth Management franchise finds very attractive is, we want an open platform. And so when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very, very broad, very, very deep, very, very unique offering as one of the top five or six alts providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products, what we're manufacturing out of our Asset Management business. But in addition, we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all different world-class managers around the world across the spectrum. And so I think that's a very, very unique offering that very, very affluent people who wealth manage at Goldman Sachs find super attractive and super differentiated.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask one on your M&A franchise. So the recovery in announced M&A has been really impressive, but really kind of dominated by strategic, and given your strong franchise among sponsors, I'm curious to get an update about what you're seeing among that cohort and maybe when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side.\nDavid Solomon: Yes. Brennan, that's -- I appreciate that question. And that's a sharp observation on your part. The sponsor activity is still muted, but I would say it's definitely picking up. The engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved. And as I've said before, sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things. And the level of activity has been incredibly muted. And when you look at the LP community, the LP community is putting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return. And so I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. I'd say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the first quarter than it was throughout 2023. But I would say it's still operating at lower levels. There's a lot of upside for our business. Our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity. And so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly. When I look at our leveraged finance deals book, it's still operating at historically very, very low levels. We feel fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital flexibility. That was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously very accretive and attractive business. We're not seeing it really accelerate yet, but I think it's coming. And certainly, the sustained level we've had over the -- the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not sustainable. It will pick up. It's just a question of when. And so that is a potential tailwind for our business in future quarters.\nBrennan Hawken: Great. Thanks. Thanks for that color, David. I appreciate it. And then another question on alts. So, fundraising looks really good. I know there can be some noise in the revenue. So, just curious about the alts revenue down year-over-year and the AUS only up sort of marginally sequentially. Could you give some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Brennan, it's Denis. So, a couple of things. Obviously, the movement in AUS is a function of how we fundraise, how we deploy, and overall levels. We have had a lot of success fundraising, not just in the last quarter at $14 billion, but now with the whole $265 billion-plus since the original Investor Day. But there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to use and actually moves into AUS. Not all of our funds that are raised are AUS-ing immediately. So I think that is something you can look out for in future periods. And then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts, as David was walking through our platform, our Wealth platform in terms of having Goldman Sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture, and third-party platform, some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform, and if we look over the sequential period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. David, you reiterated the desire for Goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus, but you still have some cleanup from the past charges this quarter for GreenSky, the GM Card, Platform Solutions still lost $117 million. So I'm just trying to figure out in this context where transaction banking stands. I mean, you had 8% year-over-year growth. So, that's decent. But three years ago, March 1st, you guys said transaction banking, you're building global payments around the world. And then March 8th of this year on Bloomberg, it says that you're closed in Japan and now you're focusing on the US and Europe. So on the one hand, are you simply pulling back your ambitions? On the other hand, maybe you have more financial discipline. You're making sure these adjacent activities are generating profits instead of just growth.\nDavid Solomon: Look, Mike, I think you summarized it well. I think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. We're looking hard -- we are -- I think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. We think we've got very, very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. But there's no question we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately and that it's not just top-line growth that it delivers profitability. It's something that sits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients. I think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately. And so we've narrowed that, but we remain committed, focused, and growing. And I think this is a medium and longer-term project that we will deliver on. It's small, but I think we've got the right focus. We made a hire to bolster the expertise in the leadership and we're moving forward on that strategy. And with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and cleanup. The after-tax loss from the platforms was less than $100 million. We've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or profitability in 2025 and we're executing against that.\nMike Mayo: Just to follow up on the transaction banking. You said some ambitions were too broad. Again, it's better to have profitable growth than just growth. So, point acknowledged. But what happened? I mean, where were you kind of underestimating expenses or the build-out costs or what was more difficult than you had anticipated?\nDavid Solomon: Well, I think there were a number of things, Mike, that came together. I think when you're building new businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance. And I think there were things where we thought we could do more globally and candidly when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in that context. And so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. That doesn't mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think for now, that's the right action. I'd say secondarily, the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds in a different lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. And so that's something else that went into the mix. And so look, I think one of the things that we try to do is to look at everything with facts, with data, with information to be unemotional and to be willing to say, okay, this isn't exactly right. So we're going to adjust. And I think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the firm and delivering for shareholders, driving profitable businesses that deliver accretive returns for shareholders. We'll get some things right, we'll get some things wrong. But when we look at the information of the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good morning. So, wanted to follow up, David, on --\nDenis Coleman: Good morning.\nDavid Solomon: Good morning.\nSteven Chubak: Good morning, guys. Wanted to follow up, David, with the earlier discussion just on sponsor-related activity. Private credit fundraising remains robust, but the syndicated markets are also reopening. Just wanted to better understand what you're seeing in terms of competition in syndicated versus private markets, how it's impacting your IB&O franchises. And just given some of the recent price coverage, maybe just speak to your growth ambitions in the private credit space more broadly.\nDavid Solomon: Sure. I'm going to -- I'll make a couple of comments, but I'm going to ask Denis to comment too because as you know, Denis -- Denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. But I'd just say first, the narrative that in some way, shape or form, this is -- this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, I think is an oversimplification. As transaction volumes increase, particularly in the sponsor community, the amount of activity that will come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully. We're very well-positioned for that. We are one of the largest players in that and that area is operating at cyclical lows at the moment. But that's going to continue to be a very, very important part of capital formation and it's not going away. The growth in private credit will continue. I think we're very well-positioned for that. We have about $130 billion of private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. I've said publicly, we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow, and we see a number of places where we can do that. We're very focused on that. I do think it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. And so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle, is a little bit unclear at the moment. But I think strategically, we're in a very, very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. And you can see that. I mean, I can point to a transaction that was done in the last -- in the last few months we did just that. And in fact, it wasn't just in credit, it was in equity too, you can look at the Endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender, but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors as an example of the way that I think that our franchise and our platform is differentiated. Denis, do you want to add anything to those comments?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. I think it's well-covered. I mean, I think there was -- there's been a lot of discussion over the past of the -- past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative, but the reality is, the syndicated alternative didn't really exist. And so it was really just a discussion around private credit. With first quarter activity levels, you now see a viable, functioning, and healthy syndicated loan market. The vast majority of the activity was actually refinancing. A lot of that refinancing was refinancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-based syndicated market. So the reality is, these are all just forms of credit made available to different borrowers. And over time, I think there'll be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions, in some cases, existing in the same capital structure. And I think we're just in a healthier environment, but from Goldman Sachs' perspective is positive because the data points that we now see across the leverage lending market make sponsor estimated weighted-average cost of capital much more observable and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsor-related change of control activity. So, I think the sort of two markets functioning side-by-side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for Goldman Sachs.\nSteven Chubak: Really helpful color. And for my follow-up, just on capital management. CET1 continues to build, you're well in excess of the regulatory minimums, the direction of travel on Basel III in terms of expectations around the proposal is certainly more favorable. At the same time, it now looks like you might be more constrained by the SLR, which declined to 5.4%. I know that's never intended to be the binding constraint, but I was hoping you could just speak to how you're managing to leverage constraint, which at least appears to be binding at the moment, and what we should expect in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation there.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, yes, you're right on all counts. Obviously, we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. The SLR is a slower-moving ratio as you know, but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time. And we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that. But I appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thanks so much. The first question just on kind of maybe a bigger picture on the wallet share in Markets. I know this has really been ongoing work for the firm and obviously, not just the quarter, but really the past few years, this has been pretty consistent story. So, if we kind of move aside financing, love to maybe just drill down on some of the individual products that are accelerating in Equities and FICC and where you're most pleased with the execution that has occurred over the last several years and then still where you see the biggest room to close any gaps that are maybe still there. Thanks.\nDavid Solomon: Well, at a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed and I think we got right over a period of time, that we started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in this business. The top 150 clients provide a very significant portion of all the activity in this franchise. And so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. I think the thing that we've done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos and the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the firm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago. And so it's something we're very focused on. There are times when there's more activity in commodities, there's time when there's more activity in credit, there's time when there's more activity in mortgages. It moves and it ebbs and flows, but what we're really trying to do is to make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most effective way and we've made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years. I think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top 150, I think we stand at slightly under top three with 117 of them, don't hold me to that number exactly. It's probably, okay, 117 of them. So, obviously, we have progress to make because there's no reason why Goldman Sachs shouldn't be top three with the overwhelming majority much closer to 90% of those 150. And also when you look at top three, there are also clients where we're third, where we absolutely should be first or second. And so we continue to drill down. We continue to go, talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them. And that discipline and that rigor, I think is helping us execute for them, but there's more work to do and we don't take our position for granted. We try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute both.\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks, David. Maybe a quick follow-up here for Denis. Just on the equity investments line, not a great quarter there, not a drag either. It feels like it's been some time since we've seen maybe a more normal quarter without big puts and takes. And so just given the reconstitution of that book, how would you frame what a more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective? And then how the private portfolio is positioned if we are moving into a better exit environment. Obviously, it's been tough there as well. Thanks.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, a couple of things, and may have been embedded in your question. But obviously looking at some of the -- on the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis. Just a reminder that in Q4 when we sold Personal Financial Management, that was reflected as a gain in equity investments of about $350 million that did not repeat. So that will give you some -- some insight into how that's trending sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio, sort of in line with what you're suggesting we might expect. And what we did see a particular markdown in the public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results. We also, as you know, have been -- have focused on selling down a portion of our historical principal investments. So a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what the market conditions are, will obviously contribute -- contribute to the ultimate performance. The other guidance that we've put out there generally, medium-term guidance is that across both equity and debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year. So you could put that in the quarter, about $500 million. Those are some pieces of color I'd give you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. Actually, just to follow up on the last question and comment, the run-off of the historical principal investment from the $15 billion here, the $2 billion that you just referenced, is that the run-off that you expect, or was that alluding to the revenues per year?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. Thanks. Let me clarify. I was making a comment with respect to revenue and then separately as it relates to the rundown of that portfolio, I guess the way to think of it, picking up questions from last earnings and/or this one. The progress that we made in the first quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year. And then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. So $1.5 billion per quarter is what you're implying from here for the rest of the year?\nDenis Coleman: On the historical principal investment portfolio, yes, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion per quarter for the balance of the year.\nOperator: We'll go next to Saul Martinez with HSBC.\nSaul Martinez: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about your financing business in Markets. And obviously, there's uncertainty about the Basel end-game proposal. As you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be for it to be materially lightened or even re-proposed. But one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities financing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. And if that part of the proposal isn't materially altered, it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your financing revenues? Is it a threat? Is it not a big deal? Can you offset it through pricing, product design? Just curious if you can provide a little color on that.\nDenis Coleman: Sure. So, obviously, where Basel III ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. But I'd say the breadth of our financing activities across both FICC and Equity are much broader than that particular component. And we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for financing across both FICC and Equities will remain high. We have leading market shares and capabilities there. So we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. And depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need, either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on Basel and the implications of it being softened, Denis, you mentioned more flexibility on capital deployment, if given the direction of travel on Basel. I mean, how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here? You did $1.5 billion. Is there -- do you feel like there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to 100% of earnings?\nDenis Coleman: Sure. I appreciate the question. We were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital flexibility that we expected, but also pick up on something that David said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy, which starts with our client franchise. And some of the activities where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. And so we have a good amount of cushion and flexibility at this point in time. As our clients become more active, the first place that we're going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. And after that, we would, of course, as you note, continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend. And only after that would we think about return of capital.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs' first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Solomon",
            "content": "Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We feel very good about our first quarter results, which reflect the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our firm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter. As laid out in January, we have three strategic objectives, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class differentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at-scale. Across the firm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever. CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their firms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital, and financial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. Where we stand today, it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets, with the first few months of 2024 seen an reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit, and Rank is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing. In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the first three months of the year. Additionally, refinancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan refinancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition financing, alongside higher M&A activity, we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year. With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our firm stands to benefit further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. It's important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing financing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially. All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise, and more durable financing results are helping raise the floor in global banking and markets. In Asset & Wealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter, which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inflows. We have a diversified platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across Wealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions. In Wealth Management, we saw significant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In Alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments despite a more difficult fundraising environment. And in Solutions, we continued -- we saw continued demand for our outsourced CIO and SMA offerings. These are all areas in which we still see significant opportunities and we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win. I also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation I have, Artificial Intelligence. While there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is an enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out, including the timeline for commercial impact, shape of potential regulations, impact on jobs, and where value will accrue in the ecosystem. Today, we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer-term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectations, there will be significant demand for AI-related infrastructure and as a result, financing, which will be a tailwind to our business. For our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. We are focused on enhancing productivity, particularly for our developers, and increasing operating efficiency while maintaining a high bar for quality, security, and controls. Like with any emerging technology, a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial. Turning to the macro-environment, we continue to be constructive on the health of the US economy. The Fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I am also mindful that US equity markets are hovering near-record levels at a time when we see -- when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inflation, the commercial real estate market, and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth. But that said, the US economy has proven to be resilient, supported by a number of factors, including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration. So, while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain. Nonetheless, I'm very confident about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people, and our culture of collaboration and excellence. Every day as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities, and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dennis to cover our financial results for the quarter. Well, I appreciate it, Glenn. And I think there are a bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know that we've been focused on is building a more durable business and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package. We've made significant progress over the course of the last five years. Certainly, building our financing business in our markets business is something that's more durable and more sustainable. We still think there's lots of room to grow. And look, the world is growing and when the world grows and our clients grow, they need us to finance them. We've got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base. And so we stay focused on that. We've doubled our management fees on our Asset & Wealth Management business over the last five years and we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. Those are more durable revenues. And there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. You've seen the margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like that business to have and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there. Overall, I think, we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very, very focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. And we've said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet shares sticky? I think the wallet shares are. What I can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter-to-quarter. But when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these businesses and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where we're very well-positioned. And we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position. Sure. So, I mean, big picture and look, I'm not a stock picker, so I'm not going to comment when you make a comparison to the Internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001, I'm not going to comment around that. I think we have -- we've got a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that I think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies. But broadly speaking, these technologies require certain things, including infrastructure, power, and these things require financing to drive the scale that's going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace. And that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that we've seen in the context of other areas of significant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time. So I actually think there's a very, very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses, and we're talking about a level of scale that is -- that is candidly unprecedented. And so I think that opportunity is something over the course, this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next five to 10 years and we're very, very focused on it and very engaged. And by the way, it's not just companies, it's governments, obviously that are making enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locale. And so all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on. Double-clicking and getting more narrowly focused on Goldman Sachs, I would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efficiency. Our use cases that we're testing and that we're implementing focus on those two areas. But I'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efficiency gain that becomes very cost accretive. I think one of the most important things for this firm and the success of this firm is the time our people spend with clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients, and these tools give us more productivity, and also when we look at our datasets and what we have internally and ability to deliver them a value-added package of information, thought process that we think can be differentiated. And so we're very focused on the productivity side, although, of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efficiency and we're also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure. So we -- in January, we said to you, we thought high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. We're executing on that. We are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. Firm obviously generates a lot of capital. There could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. But at the moment, our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us and we are making good progress. But I think we put out a handful of metrics, both in terms of top-line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise, you saw that we highlighted $15 billion of fundraising in Alternatives in the first quarter. We said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this quarter -- this year. Obviously, the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year. That doesn't stop this year. We think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward. So we're focused on the things that matter in Asset Management. What matters? Performance matters, client experience matters. We're incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very -- very effectively. That was -- it was a -- it was -- there's no way to shade this. It was a strong quarter for Global Banking and Markets. Peak, I mean, I can point in the last few years to quarters in Global Banking and Markets where the returns were higher. But I certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in Global Banking and Markets. We've said clearly, we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. The performance this quarter was higher. There were performance last year was meaningfully lower. I think the right thing to focus on, Christian, is mid-teens through the cycle. That's the way we think about it. And there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter and I think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients, there is opportunity in the market. We're good at capturing that, delivering that for shareholders. And then when the environment is more tough though, this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at the past. But I would view this as a very strong quarter on Global Banking and Markets and not what we would target as the average run-rate for the business. Yes. Again, this I think comes down to focus and you know we made some very -- we talked about conscious decisions. We have talked about broadening our Wealth platform to get much more broadly into what I'd call kind of high net-worth Wealth Management. And with the sale of United Capital, we continue to be very focused on our ultra-high net-worth platform. It is an extraordinary platform. I do think it's a best-in-class platform. I do think that the ultra-high net-worth business is still a very fragmented business. While we have leading share, I think those shares are still on a global basis, a leader is a single-digit share. There's a lot of wealth in the world, there's a lot of wealth accumulating. But we are very, very well-positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. And I think the business is performing very, very well. So, our alts franchise, I think is differentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. I think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. We're expanding our private banking activity. That's not something that we have been focused on, which I think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager. So, I think there's a good runway for this business. I do think it's a best-in-class franchise that has room to grow. And I think you're seeing it perform well and we're very focused on it. I think the sharp decision around how we're going to focus this business, I think we're benefiting from at the moment. Good morning, Betsy. We can hear you fine. Thank you. Sure. I think one of the things that our Wealth Management franchise finds very attractive is, we want an open platform. And so when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very, very broad, very, very deep, very, very unique offering as one of the top five or six alts providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products, what we're manufacturing out of our Asset Management business. But in addition, we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all different world-class managers around the world across the spectrum. And so I think that's a very, very unique offering that very, very affluent people who wealth manage at Goldman Sachs find super attractive and super differentiated. Yes. Brennan, that's -- I appreciate that question. And that's a sharp observation on your part. The sponsor activity is still muted, but I would say it's definitely picking up. The engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved. And as I've said before, sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things. And the level of activity has been incredibly muted. And when you look at the LP community, the LP community is putting a lot of pressure on the financial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return. And so I do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. I'd say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the first quarter than it was throughout 2023. But I would say it's still operating at lower levels. There's a lot of upside for our business. Our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity. And so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly. When I look at our leveraged finance deals book, it's still operating at historically very, very low levels. We feel fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital flexibility. That was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously very accretive and attractive business. We're not seeing it really accelerate yet, but I think it's coming. And certainly, the sustained level we've had over the -- the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not sustainable. It will pick up. It's just a question of when. And so that is a potential tailwind for our business in future quarters. Look, Mike, I think you summarized it well. I think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. We're looking hard -- we are -- I think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. We think we've got very, very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. But there's no question we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately and that it's not just top-line growth that it delivers profitability. It's something that sits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients. I think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately. And so we've narrowed that, but we remain committed, focused, and growing. And I think this is a medium and longer-term project that we will deliver on. It's small, but I think we've got the right focus. We made a hire to bolster the expertise in the leadership and we're moving forward on that strategy. And with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and cleanup. The after-tax loss from the platforms was less than $100 million. We've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or profitability in 2025 and we're executing against that. Well, I think there were a number of things, Mike, that came together. I think when you're building new businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance. And I think there were things where we thought we could do more globally and candidly when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in that context. And so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. That doesn't mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think for now, that's the right action. I'd say secondarily, the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds in a different lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. And so that's something else that went into the mix. And so look, I think one of the things that we try to do is to look at everything with facts, with data, with information to be unemotional and to be willing to say, okay, this isn't exactly right. So we're going to adjust. And I think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the firm and delivering for shareholders, driving profitable businesses that deliver accretive returns for shareholders. We'll get some things right, we'll get some things wrong. But when we look at the information of the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust. Good morning. Sure. I'm going to -- I'll make a couple of comments, but I'm going to ask Denis to comment too because as you know, Denis -- Denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. But I'd just say first, the narrative that in some way, shape or form, this is -- this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, I think is an oversimplification. As transaction volumes increase, particularly in the sponsor community, the amount of activity that will come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully. We're very well-positioned for that. We are one of the largest players in that and that area is operating at cyclical lows at the moment. But that's going to continue to be a very, very important part of capital formation and it's not going away. The growth in private credit will continue. I think we're very well-positioned for that. We have about $130 billion of private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. I've said publicly, we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow, and we see a number of places where we can do that. We're very focused on that. I do think it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. And so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle, is a little bit unclear at the moment. But I think strategically, we're in a very, very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. And you can see that. I mean, I can point to a transaction that was done in the last -- in the last few months we did just that. And in fact, it wasn't just in credit, it was in equity too, you can look at the Endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender, but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors as an example of the way that I think that our franchise and our platform is differentiated. Denis, do you want to add anything to those comments? Well, at a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed and I think we got right over a period of time, that we started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in this business. The top 150 clients provide a very significant portion of all the activity in this franchise. And so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. I think the thing that we've done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos and the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the firm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago. And so it's something we're very focused on. There are times when there's more activity in commodities, there's time when there's more activity in credit, there's time when there's more activity in mortgages. It moves and it ebbs and flows, but what we're really trying to do is to make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most effective way and we've made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years. I think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top 150, I think we stand at slightly under top three with 117 of them, don't hold me to that number exactly. It's probably, okay, 117 of them. So, obviously, we have progress to make because there's no reason why Goldman Sachs shouldn't be top three with the overwhelming majority much closer to 90% of those 150. And also when you look at top three, there are also clients where we're third, where we absolutely should be first or second. And so we continue to drill down. We continue to go, talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them. And that discipline and that rigor, I think is helping us execute for them, but there's more work to do and we don't take our position for granted. We try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute both."

            "content": "Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the first quarter, we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $11.58, an ROE of 14.8%, and an ROTE of 15.9%. We provide details on the financial impact of selected items in the bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter. Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the first quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis. Turning to Page 4. Advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions. We remain number one in the league tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million, both rose significantly year-over-year amid an increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust. FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages, credit, and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to effectively make markets across a number of different geographies and asset classes. We produced record FICC financing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time. Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter. Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially offset by lower financing spreads. Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year. Record management and other fees were up 7% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder, we closed the sale of Personal Financial Management in November of last year, which contributed approximately $60 million in fees in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year. Based on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior year period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year in our private portfolio that was largely offset by a markdown on a large public position. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. We had $24 billion of long-term net inflows, largely in fixed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inflows. Turning to Page 7, on Alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the first quarter, driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the quarter. We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in Alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year. More broadly, we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next five years. On-balance sheet Alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the first quarter, we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. We expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026 consistent with our target. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment profitability has improved with a pre-tax net loss of $117 million for the quarter. In line with our target, we expect to drive this business to pre-tax breakeven next year. On Page 9, firmwide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter, as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially offset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reflected net charge-offs in our credit card lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters. Turning to Page 10. We continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know, we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in AWM alternative equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at-risk related to CIEs. Turning to expenses on Page 11. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efficiency ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reflecting improved operating performance for the firm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year, even inclusive of a $78 million FDIC special assessment charge, and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% and for the full year, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%. Now on to Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. We are currently running with a 170 basis point buffer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for significant modifications to the Basel III proposed rule, we should have materially more flexibility on capital deployment. We also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the strength of our leading global banking and markets franchise and our growing Asset & Wealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas for 2024 that we laid out in January, which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are confident in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Good morning, Glenn. It's Dennis. As we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very, very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. There clearly are inflationary pressures that impact a number of items in our non-comp expense. The sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. And so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very, very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. But I think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters. Good morning. Sure. So, Betsy, it's Denis. Nice to hear from you. Look, to give you some color on that, I wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. I would say the revenue generation, the activity was broad-based. But in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes. And I would observe that over the course of the quarter, it was just a very benign operating environment. Credit spreads were tightening, equity valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our Global Banking and Markets business as well. The first quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. So we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. And as David said, that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter, particularly in FICC and Equities. So, when we talk about like a Global Banking and Markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance across both FICC and Equities in Q1. Sure. Brennan, it's Denis. So, a couple of things. Obviously, the movement in AUS is a function of how we fundraise, how we deploy, and overall levels. We have had a lot of success fundraising, not just in the last quarter at $14 billion, but now with the whole $265 billion-plus since the original Investor Day. But there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to use and actually moves into AUS. Not all of our funds that are raised are AUS-ing immediately. So I think that is something you can look out for in future periods. And then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts, as David was walking through our platform, our Wealth platform in terms of having Goldman Sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture, and third-party platform, some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform, and if we look over the sequential period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year. Good morning. Sure. I think it's well-covered. I mean, I think there was -- there's been a lot of discussion over the past of the -- past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative, but the reality is, the syndicated alternative didn't really exist. And so it was really just a discussion around private credit. With first quarter activity levels, you now see a viable, functioning, and healthy syndicated loan market. The vast majority of the activity was actually refinancing. A lot of that refinancing was refinancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-based syndicated market. So the reality is, these are all just forms of credit made available to different borrowers. And over time, I think there'll be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions, in some cases, existing in the same capital structure. And I think we're just in a healthier environment, but from Goldman Sachs' perspective is positive because the data points that we now see across the leverage lending market make sponsor estimated weighted-average cost of capital much more observable and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsor-related change of control activity. So, I think the sort of two markets functioning side-by-side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for Goldman Sachs. Sure. Thanks, Steven. So, yes, you're right on all counts. Obviously, we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. The SLR is a slower-moving ratio as you know, but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time. And we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that. But I appreciate the question. Sure. Thanks for the question. So, a couple of things, and may have been embedded in your question. But obviously looking at some of the -- on the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis. Just a reminder that in Q4 when we sold Personal Financial Management, that was reflected as a gain in equity investments of about $350 million that did not repeat. So that will give you some -- some insight into how that's trending sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio, sort of in line with what you're suggesting we might expect. And what we did see a particular markdown in the public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results. We also, as you know, have been -- have focused on selling down a portion of our historical principal investments. So a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what the market conditions are, will obviously contribute -- contribute to the ultimate performance. The other guidance that we've put out there generally, medium-term guidance is that across both equity and debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year. So you could put that in the quarter, about $500 million. Those are some pieces of color I'd give you. Sure. Thanks. Let me clarify. I was making a comment with respect to revenue and then separately as it relates to the rundown of that portfolio, I guess the way to think of it, picking up questions from last earnings and/or this one. The progress that we made in the first quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year. And then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target. On the historical principal investment portfolio, yes, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion per quarter for the balance of the year. Sure. So, obviously, where Basel III ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. But I'd say the breadth of our financing activities across both FICC and Equity are much broader than that particular component. And we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for financing across both FICC and Equities will remain high. We have leading market shares and capabilities there. So we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. And depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need, either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients. Sure. I appreciate the question. We were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital flexibility that we expected, but also pick up on something that David said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy, which starts with our client franchise. And some of the activities where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. And so we have a good amount of cushion and flexibility at this point in time. As our clients become more active, the first place that we're going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. And after that, we would, of course, as you note, continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend. And only after that would we think about return of capital."
