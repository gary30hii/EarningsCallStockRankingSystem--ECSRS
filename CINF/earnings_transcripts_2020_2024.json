At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. \nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. Please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Everyone knows that this past year was full of challenges. We worked closely with the independent agents who represent us to react quickly to changing needs of their clients as the pandemic progressed and to keep business flowing. The communities we serve saw an unusually high level of catastrophe activity. While no one likes to witness the pain and destruction these events bring, it is when our field claims representative shine delivering support with empathy and warrant. Our headquarters associates remain focussed on our key priorities even though they have had to adapt to working at home, balancing family and business responsibilities in new ways. Despite those challenges, our associates and agents responded with determination and focus, helping us to produce the healthy financial performance we reported today. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 rose 68% compared with the fourth quarter a year ago, including increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. The fourth quarter of 2020 included very good investment performance, investment income grew 2% and full year 2020 growth at 4% March 2019. Dividend income rose 7% for the fourth quarter. Net purchases for the equity portfolio during 2020 totaled $184 million. Interest income for our bond portfolio grew 2% on both a fourth quarter and full year basis. The pre-tax average yield was 4.11% for the fourth quarter, one basis point below the same period a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for purchase bonds during full year 2020 was 3.97% compared with 4.14% the prior year. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio with net purchases during the year totaling $291 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were again favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net gain was just over $1.1 billion before tax effects, including $975 million for our equity portfolio, and $149 million for a bond portfolio.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mike. 2020 gave us ample opportunity to demonstrate our ingenuity and our flexibility. It's been a year we won't soon forget. And it's been a year that illustrated the strength of our company given me great confidence in the future of Cincinnati financial. As a reminder, Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenback and Theresa Hoffer. Erica, please open the call for questions.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Yes, thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Sorry, if I missed this in the prepared remarks. The 90 basis points of pandemic losses and expenses in the quarter could you just provide some details on, the actual geography or what comprised of comprised of those reserves?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. So related to the pandemic for the fourth quarter, so we reported in total, it's going to be $13.4 million, which is 0.9 points on the estimated combined ratio. So related to that, so $8 million was related to legal expenses to defend ourselves on the CIC policies that do not cover there. And then there was three, just a little over 3 million for Cincinnati Re, and then a little over 2 million for CGU. And those are the ones that have the affirmative coverage. So when you add all that up the 8 million 32, it's about 13 million. So it's about 0.9 on the combined ratio. If you want on a year-to-date basis, in total now, for the legal defense, that was 30 million that we had reported, and then for Cinci Re, it was 19 million, for CGU it was just under 12 million.\nPhil Stefano: Got it. Understood. These are small numbers, but either how are you thinking about the on-going nature of the pandemic, versus the affirmative coverage that you have from Cinci Re and Cinci Global. And the potential for, any COVID charges to, to continue into next year?\nSteve Johnston: That that's a great question. And we watch this every quarter. Every quarter, as we close the books, we've got a, we've got to nail the reserves as best we can. So we do go through a process a lot of folks that are involved in estimating. And so in this case, there's really three camps. You've got the Cincinnati Global, the Cincinnati Re folks, and then you've got the CIC primary business side, which is primarily the claim side of the house, along with legal counsel, as they look at the number of claims that have been filed, the number of claims that are coming off. What are we doing, settling them quicker. There's just multiple factors that go into those estimates. And those estimates are redone each quarter. Of course, when you take a look at the Cincinnati Re side, the Cincinnati Global side, they're looking at the policies that they've written, that have the affirmative coverage, they know which ones they have. And so they're monitoring those throughout the quarter. And then looking at, I'll say, case basis reserves on those and making their best picks. So we are coming and reporting to the ultimate that we believe at the end of each quarter. So that's a great, great question. Hopefully I answered the question.\nPhil Stefano: No, no, that's good. And just one more and I'll re-queue. Switching gears and thinking about new business. I saw in the earnings release, there was commentary that the new business premiums were down. And in some ways that reflected increased competition with fewer policies that adequate pricing levels. At the same time, it feels like we're in this firming or firm or hard market, however you want to - the terminology around it. But your renewal pricing is up mid-single digits. How do we reconcile this firming market that we're in versus the adequate pricing levels maybe not being where they need to be in in some lines?\nSteve Spray: Hi Phi, it\u2019s Steve Spray here. I would answer that with the fact that just we're in - our industry is in such a - it's just such a dynamic environment. And some of the classes of business or segments that you see that hit the headlines as far as the highest, the firming market or hardening market would be maybe in larger DNO policies, larger excess casualty policies, commercial property that would be catastrophe exposed or cat exposed coastal. Those are certainly hardening and it just varies across industry segment and class. When you get into more, I'll call it mainstream business, we're looking at every single risk on a case by case basis. We're trying to determine an adequate price for that business and I'd say our field underwriters, our agents are working through each of those accounts again, risk by risk, and just doing a great job. We've continued to see the metrics of our pricing on new business and renewals improved throughout the year. So I think that's part of it. Another part of it that I would say that I've gotten a lot of feedback from agencies and talk to enough of them that one of the phenomenon\u2019s in a pandemic was just that, fewer policyholders were going to market with their insurance. And it typically was around, let's say, there was no pain with the incumbent carrier. They weren't getting a large rate increase, they didn't have prior loss ratio problems or challenges. And so they might just be sitting tight. For the year, they've got other things to concern themselves with. So again, it really gets back to adequate pricing.\nPhil Stefano: Understood. Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Yes, good morning. Maybe you can kind of talk to excellent underlying margins, again, this quarter. Curious if, if you guys, if you and your colleagues are recognizing, what we've been seeing, as I'm hearing is kind of a more benign frequency trend in 2020. Especially, obviously we can see them personal lines. But speaking more to the commercial lines, kind of curious if you've been reflecting some of that frequency benefit within the numbers.\nSteve Johnston: Yes, Mike is Steve Johnston. And we have seen improving trends. And I think, I think part of it comes from the on-going effort that we've been doing. And Steve described in terms of our discipline, and pricing and underwriting what we're doing with the segmentation of risks, and using all the tools that we bring to the market, including our claims service, and everything that all of our field representatives do. So we've seen on-going improvement over time, pre-COVID in terms of our results. No doubt COVID and its impact on the economy have had some benefits. And it's just hard to bifurcate between the two, how much you apply to one and how much that you apply to the other. I think the key point is that we're well positioned as we go forward with our field force with all the expertise that we have, as we look forward to appropriately pricing and writing risks in the future.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, I understand that it's complicated. And there's a lot of moving parts, maybe ask a different way, maybe you can give us some color on kind of what loss trend you're assuming on the more recent accident years? Is that, is it kind of a low single digit loss trend you you're sticking with? And maybe that could give us more color?\nSteve Johnston: I think the key point with the loss trend is that Re making its perspective. And so when we talk about a loss trend, we're always talking about what our estimate of the trend is going to be applicable prospectively, in this perspective, rate, rating policy period. So we'll be making a case for policies that will be effect 2021 and beyond. And so when we think about trends, we think about with everything that would affect loss costs, including what we're dealing with loss control, underwriting, the segmentation of our book. And so that's the way we look at loss cost trends, not necessarily just this past year, over the previous year, something historic. In regard to that, we do feel that the rates that we are promulgating are in excess of the loss cost trends that we're estimating.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, great. And one last question. I'll probably get back in the queue. You thanks for bringing up the Ohio Supreme Court to certify to request an answer to a key question. Is that, if you can remind us -- was that accepted by the court and is there a time line or timeframe we should think about?\nSteve Johnston: No, that is still open to the court. They have not decided one way or the other on that yet.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, so they haven't decided to, to see the question just to be clear, or a or is it open?\nSteve Johnston: That's correct. They haven't decided one way or the other, whether they will see the question. It's still in process.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you Mike\nOperator:  Your next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks, one really quick one on the BI  if I can. Can you just call it how much protection remains on your 2020 catastrophe reinsurance?\nSteve Johnston: I'm trying to think if we used any on the derecho. It would have been just a little bit if we did. Maybe like in the 2, 3 million of the layer.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, so that's fantastic. Bigger picture question, Steve. How much credibility are your actuaries using for loss experience in 2020, given how unusual the year was?\nSteve Johnston: Yes, and that's, that's the balance between and I'm telling somebody that doesn't need to be told this. You're very knowledgeable that, but it's just the balance that they're using, between responsiveness and stability to the trends. They're looking at it really in detail. It's not like one answer across the company as they do rate work and so forth. It's going on, by state by coverage by line, by year, and I think they're doing a good job of prudently. No, reflecting responsiveness and stability. It's a season that experienced and talented group of actuaries. And I think, again, to that key point of where we'll be prospectively right, adequacy wise. I think we're going to be in good position.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. And then I know you've talked in the past about your comfort with the language in I guess the CIC policies? Are there any policy language changes plan for I guess, excess and surplus or CGU or on reinsurance to exclude communicable diseases?\nSteve Johnston: I would say, on our Cincinnati Re, they have as they have renewed policies that we reinsure, there have been some changes. There be the one that comes to mind.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's perfect. Thank you so much.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks Meyer.\nOperator: Your next question is from Scott Heleniak, with RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Heleniak: Hi, good morning. Wonder if you could first talk on the 6% premium growth expectation you're talking about? Can you just kind of flush that out in terms of the areas that you might find most attractive on that? Is it going to be kind of similar to Q4, where you had the specialty reinsurance and E&S  kind of driving that? or how are you, how are you looking at that more by segment?\nSteve Johnston: Yes, that's an overall number. And I do think it's consistent with a continuation of what we've seen. If you know we\u2019re obviously we're out there competing every day in the market and as the market ebbs and flows and changes that it may. It may change as we go out through the year, but it reflects more of I think, what you've seen with an emphasis towards those that are a little bit slower to grow a little bit faster. I think personal lines in particular has trended pretty nicely here over the last quarter, of course, excess and surplus lines has been double digit. So yes, I think it's going to be not inconsistent with what we've seen.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. And then, along those lines, on personal lines, and you mentioned in the press release to the significant growth, and you've seen in the high net worth business, which was up 25%. And just wondering if you can talk about sort of the long term opportunities there, and it's, it does seem like it's becoming a little bit of a more competitive environment there. But just your plans on you've come a long way with that, but your plans on scaling that up over kind of the next three to five years, just geography or distribution or just any, any other thoughts on that?\nSteve Johnston: Sure, Scott. Yes we're extremely pleased with what we're doing, not just in high net worth. But I think a key point here is, we, our strategy has always been an agency strategy. So I think we've got ourselves in a in a really good position with our agents. Historically, we were predominantly a middle market personal lines company. It's about a billion dollars of our billion and a half. And over the last seven years through expertise, product, service, you name it, we've grown that high net worth the words 500 million plus, today. And I think, I think we're in a really good position, sophisticated pricing tools that we have the expertise that we've brought on board, that we can, as we've always wanted to be just be the most important partner for our agents across the entire personalized segment. But as far as expanding territories, for high net worth, we've pretty much we've pretty much done that over the last five years. We've gotten into the territories where that business is predominantly resides. And I think we've got ourselves in a good position with our agents. They've shown a lot of confidence in us, obviously, with the growth. We've I think we've responded, as we would expect with claims and our coverage forms and such. So just really feel good about the direction we're going with personal lines in general, both on pricing, excuse me on profitability and growth.\nScott Heleniak: Okay, that's, that's helpful detail. And then just the last one was on the reserve releases, they kind of returned to sort of a run rate you saw in the first half of the year during the fourth quarter. And wanted to get a little more detail on two specific areas? The first is the commercial casualty, which saw about six points or releases. And then you had a modest reserve edition and home owners three points, just wondering if you could provide a little more detail on both those areas.\nMike Sewell: Yes, this is Mike. And thanks for the question. So yes, you're right. So overall for the for the year, 2.3 points. Overall, that was a little bit on the probably, I'll say the lower side, we've been running. I'll say three to five points in any given year. But the 2.3 points just overall is very similar to 2017 and actually 2014. And so last year was probably a little bit on the higher end of the range this year, a little bit on the lower end. Thinking about it on a year, year-to-date basis where we added reserves unfavorable was commercial auto. That was up $17 million. That was mainly due to some large losses in 2016. So the encourage were coming in a little bit higher. So we adjusted the ultimate, looking back at that, that year, as it relates to. We also added a little bit on Cinci Re, and also on the surplus on the surplus INTNS  that was 2016. And prior primarily that was coming in, Cinci Re that was a little bit more of a current accident year. Related to commercial casualty, workers comp. That was actually we were just seeing favorable development across several years. And so when you take a look at that on a year-to-date basis, I'm going to say it was kind of evenly spread between accident year 19, 18, 17, and so forth. So just, not one specific item that made that jump up with that favorable development, but over the various accident years. So, as I said in my prepared comments, we follow a consistent approach. And we've got some of the great same professionals that are coming up with the ultimate reserve pic. So we\u2019ll follow we\u2019ll follow their guidance.\nScott Heleniak: Great question. Thank you.\nMike Sewell: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question is from a Fred Nelson, a private investor.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you hear me?\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, Fred.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oh, hey, good morning. A couple of questions, forward thinking income tax us with the new administration any possibility? And your thought, are you working on that? The other thing that concerns me sharing automobiles here in California, I pay $0.50 a gallon tax to the state for the road repairs. And I think the federal $0.17, my neighbour brought an electric car and is bragging that he doesn't have to pay any of that. Any thought on how that's going to be done? And is it going to affect the auto policies at all?\nMike Sewell: Fred, this is Mike. I'll take the first question. And then and then we'll let the second question someone else pick that up. So yes, you're right with the new administration there was a lot of talk before the election of which direction it would go in. When you look at Capitol Hill, and who's running what we would suspect that there probably will be at some point you know tax changes that will be coming. We've heard things of 25%, 28%. What will it be? When will it be? We are looking at that modeling it out, and so forth. But, over the years, tax rates have changed, and we've changed with it. So we'll, we'll go with what comes at us and, and work to win.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nSteve Johnston: I think on the cars Fred, we're just continue to look closely at those trends in terms of the, how the driving goes in California and in other states and how government policy interacts with that and be in a position to reflect it. Good question. Good question.\nUnidentified Analyst: No, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. There's a lot of changes coming in. So thank you. I appreciate. I just want to say thank you, Jim Miller too.\nSteve Johnston: Yes, thank you, Jim Miller, for those of you who don't know, he was our Chief Investment Officer, and just passed away here in the last couple of weeks. And he will be greatly missed by his family, the community and the company. Thank you for mentioning that, Fred.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you guys and gals. I appreciate you too. Gosh, I've been a shareholder since 1992. When the book value was below $28. It's hard to believe.\nSteve Johnston: We appreciate your, your enthusiasm for our company, Fred.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you guys and gals.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: I\u2019m through. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. Management, your closing remarks, please?\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Erica. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2021 call. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenback and Theresa Hoffer. Erica, please open the call for questions. Yes. So related to the pandemic for the fourth quarter, so we reported in total, it's going to be $13.4 million, which is 0.9 points on the estimated combined ratio. So related to that, so $8 million was related to legal expenses to defend ourselves on the CIC policies that do not cover there. And then there was three, just a little over 3 million for Cincinnati Re, and then a little over 2 million for CGU. And those are the ones that have the affirmative coverage. So when you add all that up the 8 million 32, it's about 13 million. So it's about 0.9 on the combined ratio. If you want on a year-to-date basis, in total now, for the legal defense, that was 30 million that we had reported, and then for Cinci Re, it was 19 million, for CGU it was just under 12 million.

We've continued to see the metrics of our pricing on new business and renewals improved throughout the year. So I think that's part of it. Another part of it that I would say that I've gotten a lot of feedback from agencies and talk to enough of them that one of the phenomenon's in a pandemic was just that, fewer policyholders were going to market with their insurance. And it typically was around, let's say, there was no pain with the incumbent carrier. They weren't getting a large rate increase, they didn't have prior loss ratio problems or challenges. And so they might just be sitting tight. For the year, they've got other things to concern themselves with. So again, it really gets back to adequate pricing. Thanks, Phil."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. The fourth quarter of 2020 included very good investment performance, investment income grew 2% and full year 2020 growth at 4% March 2019. Dividend income rose 7% for the fourth quarter. Net purchases for the equity portfolio during 2020 totaled $184 million. Interest income for our bond portfolio grew 2% on both a fourth quarter and full year basis. The pre-tax average yield was 4.11% for the fourth quarter, one basis point below the same period a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for purchase bonds during full year 2020 was 3.97% compared with 4.14% the prior year. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio with net purchases during the year totaling $291 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the fourth quarter of 2020 were again favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net gain was just over $1.1 billion before tax effects, including $975 million for our equity portfolio, and $149 million for a bond portfolio. Yes, this is Mike. And thanks for the question. So yes, you're right. So overall for the for the year, 2.3 points. Overall, that was a little bit on the probably, I'll say the lower side, we've been running. I'll say three to five points in any given year. But the 2.3 points just overall is very similar to 2017 and actually 2014. And so last year was probably a little bit on the higher end of the range this year, a little bit on the lower end. Thinking about it on a year, year-to-date basis where we added reserves unfavorable was commercial auto. That was up $17 million. That was mainly due to some large losses in 2016. So the encourage were coming in a little bit higher. So we adjusted the ultimate, looking back at that, that year, as it relates to. We also added a little bit on Cinci Re, and also on the surplus on the surplus INTNS  that was 2016. And prior primarily that was coming in, Cinci Re that was a little bit more of a current accident year. Related to commercial casualty, workers comp. That was actually we were just seeing favorable development across several years. And so when you take a look at that on a year-to-date basis, I'm going to say it was kind of evenly spread between accident year 19, 18, 17, and so forth. So just, not one specific item that made that jump up with that favorable development, but over the various accident years. So, as I said in my prepared comments, we follow a consistent approach. And we've got some of the great same professionals that are coming up with the ultimate reserve pic. So we'll follow we'll follow their guidance. Alright. Thank you. Fred, this is Mike. I'll take the first question. And then and then we'll let the second question someone else pick that up. So yes, you're right with the new administration there was a lot of talk before the election of which direction it would go in. When you look at Capitol Hill, and who's running what we would suspect that there probably will be at some point you know tax changes that will be coming. We've heard things of 25%, 28%. What will it be? When will it be? We are looking at that modeling it out, and so forth. But, over the years, tax rates have changed, and we've changed with it. So we'll, we'll go with what comes at us and, and work to win."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We continue to confidently execute our agency centered strategy bolstered by the steady improvement we see in our core book of business. The third quarter was active in terms of weather events and developments in the litigation landscape of pandemic-related business interruption claims. Recently, courts have granted some of our motions to dismiss based on lack of physical damage to property, while some others have been voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs. And the cases that have proceeded past initial motions, we continue to believe that business interruption coverage under our policy does not apply and that the courts ultimately should decide that economic loss alone without physical alteration of property does not trigger coverage under a property policy of insurance. We're confident in our legal strategy, given our understanding of the law and decisions in the majority of business interruption court cases rendered to-date. To the extent, we have setbacks, we'll continue to pursue the judicial process. We remain focused on executing our long-term plans. Net income for the third quarter of 2020 rose 95% compared with the third quarter a year ago, reflecting increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income was down $116 million for the quarter with higher catastrophe losses reducing it by $152 million more than last year on an after-tax basis. Our 103.6% property casualty combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points higher than a year ago with the elevated catastrophe losses representing 13.0 points of the increase. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses continue to improve and was 3.1 percentage points better than last year on a nine month basis. We see an ongoing benefit to our results from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography and likewise from segmentation of risks as we underwrite and price policies. While economic effects of the pandemic and pricing discipline continue to slow our premium growth, we believe we are growing our business profitably in our relationships with the independent agents who represent us remain very strong. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 3% in the third quarter of 2020. As a comparison growth was 6% in the second quarter and 10% for both the first quarter of the year and full year 2019. We see indicators of good underwriting and pricing discipline. Renewal pricing during the third quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for perspective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment with each one, again, experiencing mid single-digit percent range estimated average price increases. Average pricing was a little higher than in the second quarter for our largest lines of business, commercial casualty and commercial property. And those property policies renewing during the quarter averaged in the high single-digit range. New business written premium volume was again a key factor causing slower premium growth, while overall submissions from agencies for us to quote premiums for policies during the third quarter were higher than last year. For commercial risks, our underwriters declined submissions at a higher rate. The combined ratio for our commercial lines segment was 9.0 percentage points higher compared with third quarter a year ago, reflecting the 10.7 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our personal lines segment grew third quarter net written premiums by 5% and our high net worth business continues to progress as planned. The combined ratio for personal lines was 1.1 percentage points higher than the third quarter a year ago, with underlying improved performance masked by catastrophe losses that were 15.8 points higher. Our excess and surplus lines segment returned to producing an underwriting profit with an 86.7% combined ratio and grew third quarter net written premiums by 8%. As previously reported, both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global experienced significant catastrophe losses and their combined is exceeded 100%. Nearly 80% of their third quarter 2020 total catastrophe losses were from Hurricane Laura, where our agency produced business had only $4 million of catastrophe losses. Our life insurance subsidiary reported outstanding results with third quarter net income up 50% from last year and non-GAAP operating income up 31%. It grew term life insurance earned premium by 4%. My prepared remarks conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our VCR was 6.3% for the third quarter of 2020, including 5.5 percentage points contributed by improved valuation of our investment portfolio. That brought our VCR to 3.0% for the first nine months of this year. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will comment on other important areas of our financial results.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter 2020 investment performance was good, including investment income growing by 4% for both the quarter and on a nine month basis, matching the rate of growth for full year 2019. Dividend income rose 10% for the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2020, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $169 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3% compared with the same quarter a year ago. The pre-tax average yield was 4.03%, matching the third quarter of last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax exempt bonds during the third quarter was 3.42%. We continue to invest in the fixed-maturity portfolio with net purchases during the first nine months of the year totaling $236 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2020 were again favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net gain was $645 million before tax effects, including $530 million for our equity portfolio and $115 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio net appreciated value of nearly $4.9 billion, including almost $4 billion in our equity portfolio. Cash flow continues to help us grow investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2020 was very good and generated $1.1 billion, up 27% from a year ago. Expense management remains a priority as we worked the balance strategic business investments with expense controls. The third quarter 2020 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.6 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. The pandemic has caused lower spending for several items, such as business travel. We expect some of those expenses to return to a normal rate in future quarters as governmental restrictions ease. In addition, catastrophe losses at levels closer to our historical average should cause agency profit sharing ratios to return to a more usual level. Turning to loss reserves. Our consistent approach aimed for net amount in the upper half of the actually estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the third quarter of 2020, we experienced property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 0.8% for the quarter or $11 million and was still favorable overall, but lower than a typical quarter. Each quarter, we consider new informations, such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. As we obtain and study new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. While most other major lines of business and our excess and surplus line segment, we experienced favorable reserve development during the third quarter, the updated estimates resulted in an unfavorable amount of $10 million for our commercial auto line of business. While the ratio effect for the quarter was noticeable, the total dollar amount was less than 2% of total outstanding reserves for the commercial auto. The development was driven by large losses for accident years 2018 and 2016. Because commercial auto case incurred losses for those periods were higher than we expected. We again took prudent action and kept IBNR reserves at a level that increased our estimated ultimate loss for those accident years. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first nine months of the year was favorable for the two most recent accident years with $71 million for 2019 and $42 million for 2018. In aggregate, I think there is prior to 2018 were unfavorable by $22 million. Capital management is another important company function, we believe that our financial strength remains excellent, including plenty of financial flexibility. As I always do, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio, property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.25. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.11. Investment income other than life insurance reduced by non-insurance operations added $0.58. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.57. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.60. And we declared $0.60 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $3.01 per share during the third quarter to a record high $60.57 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mike. Severe weather again challenged our results, we see reasons for optimism. The dedication demonstrated by our associates is one reason I'm optimistic. While most of our headquarters associates continue to work from home, they are proving that they are equipped and motivated to continue providing outstanding service to agents and their clients. Our IT associates have continued to move technology initiatives forward. Through their efforts, we are in two awards from IVANS, a division of applied systems that were announced in September. The IVANS digital insurer program recognizes carriers that are committed to supporting independent agents needs for digital connectivity using modern technologies. We are one of only seven gold award winners in personal lines and also a silver award winner in commercial lines. Our field associates continue to work closely with agents, each time we are able to help our agents manage risk for their clients or make a policyholder hole after a covered loss. We're inspired to refocus our efforts, delivering outstanding empathetic service and building financial strength for the future. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hoffer. Jason, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to get a little more color on the drop-off and favorable development for commercial lines. And look, as a \u2013 for example, if I look at commercial auto, we have 5.5 points of adverse in the quarter, but the underlying loss ratio improved something like 10 points or 11 points. How should we be thinking about the reconciliation of these two seemingly opposing trends?\nMike Sewell: Yes. Great question. This is Mike. When looking at our favorable development for the quarter overall, obviously it was down to 0.8 points as I noted, commercial auto having really one of the larger effects of being adverse for 10 million. And some of that was really from larger losses, as I indicated in some older accident years. And so as the case incurred there, what we did is we kept the IBNR up until we see the ultimate payments for those to really play out. So current accident year is improving, it was really what we were seeing in 2018 and 2016, that was causing that. So we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. If I think about overall reserve development for the last several years, we've been running, I'll say 2.5 points to 5 points of favorable development. Full year 2017 was 4.7 on year-to-day basis right now we're at 2.1. So we're going to follow a consistent basis, let's wait and see what the fourth quarter has in store for us and follow our actuaries consistent approach.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. Maybe thinking more generally about underlying loss ratios. Can you remind us how you're contemplating rate versus trend in the current environment and to what extent should we think about an underlying benefit coming through versus the conservatism and the waiting for this business to season to make sure that the pricing was indeed in excess of loss trend?\nSteve Johnston: That\u2019s a key point, Phil. This is Steve Johnston and we do feel as we've mentioned that loss costs \u2013 the rates are ahead of our loss cost trends. And we think we're seeing that as we've seen continued improvement in our core book with our underlying core accident year ex-CAT combined ratio improving by 6.2 points I believe. I think the key point is it's difficult to precisely bifurcate the improvement that we've seen in the loss experience between this COVID period and the actions that we've been taking over a number of years to improve that loss experience, they're kind of blend together. And I think the key point is to look perspectively, right, making this perspective, right now our actuaries are working on what the appropriate rate level should be filed for effective dates in 2021. And so they'll be doing that on a state-by-state \u2013 very granular, state-by-state, coverage-by-coverage basis, they\u2019ll be looking at a number of quarters of past data to come up with their trends, to come up with the rates. So we're confident that the key point is as we go forward that we continue to have our rates in an adequate position and also in a position in which we can grow just as we've had here the last several years. We've been growing faster than the industry with the combined ratio lower than the industry for eight or nine years in a row now. And so, the key is I think to look forward, use of the data that we have understand that during this pandemic period there are some distortions in there and just make sure that we can hit the sweet spot with our rates next year that put us in a position to grow and grow profitably.\nPhil Stefano: Got it. Okay. And the last one I'll ask about, in the opening remarks kind of dug into this. But there is this judgment in North Carolina that obviously broke against you. How does it change the posturing of your defense moving forward? Have you seen any claims start to get re-filed now that we potentially have a plaintiff argument that works against you? How should we get comfortable with the potential exposure here from our seats? Any color you could provide will be truly appreciated.\nSteve Johnston: Sure. Good question. And we remain confident in our legal position, we plan to appeal the decision, we continue to believe that the business interruption coverage under our policy in this case does not apply because there was no structural alteration to property. The prevailing view by courts around the country has been that economic loss alone doesn't qualify as direct physical damage or loss of property, which is the trigger for business interruption coverage. So there is no change in the legal strategy. And also we haven't any uptick to this point in claims being reported.\nPhil Stefano: Okay, thanks. I've been watching my conjunctions much more closely. Thank you guys and best of luck.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Hey, good morning. Congrats on the quarter.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Newsome: I wanted to revisit the reserve issue just a little bit. I think I heard you say that the reserves prior to 2018 are an aggregate negative. Could you \u2013 that's a little bit different than what you\u2019d historically reported. Could you talk about sort of the trends back in that section? And were there any mass torts in there or specialist or anything like that that would have disordered that, take us 2017 and prior number?\nSteve Johnston: This is Steve again. And it really was I think generated by some large losses in those prior accident years. So we still as always feel confident in the reserve that we booked our estimate our best estimate that our reserves are in a good position as they've always been. It's a little bit less than we've seen in other quarters that we're still showing favorable development year-to-date at 2.1%. And that's not that far out of the range of where we've been in previous full years. I think if we go back to 2014, we've had a couple of years where we've been in the 2% range of favorable development. So I think one thing for the quarter, just of note also when you compare it to the third quarter a year ago is workers\u2019 comp, which is a big \u2013 one of our bigger reserved lines. It developed favorably third quarter a year ago by 27%, it\u2019s still a strong number at 9.6% this quarter. But that's in terms of a difference in dollars that's a big difference between this year and last.\nPaul Newsome: But no mass torts [indiscernible] big losses that would distort that 2017 prior, okay.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you. I failed to identify that question and yes, it's a no mass torts.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Any updates on some of these new businesses like the reinsurance business [indiscernible] business that are notable in the quarter and having increased impact I assume on the business.\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I mean, we're confident in both, they're both growing nicely, as you saw from the numbers in total up about 26%, very confident in the underwriting. We know there is going to be some volatility there in terms of results, I've done an inception to date basis even through this really tough time for those lines of business, they're both at a breakeven or a little bit better than breakeven. Both are looking for ways that they can take advantage of affirming market to right new business and we feel good about both of those businesses.\nPaul Newsome: So thank you very much.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Once again, your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Thanks so much. A couple of follow-ups on some of the previous questions. So clearly it's great underlying accident year loss ratio in a lot of lines. And so I just want to kind of be clear, should we be kind of take \u2013 assuming that there is been kind of a somewhat of a distortions, I think you said a benefit from COVID in terms of lower frequencies especially in some of the longer tail lines, and just so maybe we shouldn't right rate that, or do you think that there is potential for some of that to be sustainable maybe at a lesser level in the near term? Just trying to get a little bit more color, given how good it looked?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I think that \u2013 this is Steve again, I think that there was some benefit from the pandemic related slow down that you would see is just we've also been working, and Steve spray may want to talk about this a little bit more. We've really been working hard to improve the core results that's been our mantra through this whole COVID period is that we want all of our people to not be distracted by everything that's out in the environment, and to really focus on improving the core book of business. And Steve can touch on some of those reasons. So we think that a lot of the improvement is independent of what we've seen from the pandemic slow down, it's just hard to split those accurately into two pieces. So going forward we're confident that we can hit the profitability targets and growth targets that we've communicated to you over the long-term. And Steve, you might want to comment on some of the specifics.\nSteve Spray: Yes sure, and hi Mike. Steve is right, difficult to bifurcate it, but it's continued execution that we're seeing at both our field underwriters and our headquarters underwriters and segmenting the book by line of business and then by account. And just focused on getting the right rate on a risk adjusted basis account-by-account, getting more rate on those that we feel give us less opportunity for making a profit. And then really focusing on retaining that business that we feel gives us a better shot at margin. So it continues to evolve, the underwriters continue to get better and better at execution working with our agents. I think that's an advantage for us as well. Mike is the fact that there is something like this that almost 2,000 of our associates already work from their homes in the communities where our agents are making decisions locally. And we think that contact, that those deep relationships with fewer agents are going to help care to with growth and profitability.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, got it. And this is helpful. And I understand it's difficult. So then would this tie in a little bit to, it seems like the town in the 10-Q and kind of on some of the growth metrics has slowed down a little bit, kind of when you talked about \u2013 even though submissions were up you declined more. So are you guys trying to be a little bit more cautious now, which seems like it was a little change of tone versus last quarter when it felt like playing a little bit more offense. Anything I should read into this quarter, or is it just normal volatility?\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think its normal volatility, but I would tell you this, we are still playing offense. We've got plenty of capital, we are out there looking to help our agents grow. I think it goes back to your \u2013 kind of your prior question to Mike, is we just got such a better look into the book and we continue to evolve with these pricing sophistication, pricing precision tools that our underwriters, both field and headquarters just \u2013 are executing on discipline to walk away. So that's why the declination ratio would be higher. There is many reasons why an underwriter would decline a risk, it could be distressed from prior losses, they could do an inspection and find a premises to be unacceptable. A lot of times it's just terms and conditions, and they'll get an indication of what the renewal pricing is going to be. And just say that, like we are talking before that they just don't feel that they can make a risk adjusted return, risk by risk. So we think that that's creating some \u2013 the market is kind of bouncing around, it's based on mix of business, it\u2019s based on size of account, where you'll see more firm pricing in the marketplace. So it's \u2013 that's I think creating some volatility is a fair way to state it.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And follow-up on the North Carolina appeals process, any color on \u2013 does the appeals process take many quarters or is this kind of something that could \u2013 we could hear a resolution on in the \u2013 before year-end, any color there?\nSteve Johnston: Good question. And I'm not lawyer. I think our notice of appeal is due here in the first part of November. My understanding is after that the court will establish a schedule for briefing and oral arguments. And then we\u2019ve \u2013 it's just uncertain after that. We don't expect a decision by the North Carolina court of appeals, maybe until \u2013 into early 2021. But that's all, like I say, I'm not a lawyer that's uncertain, I'd say just the one thing that I would know is that we'll get our notice of appeal in here in the first part of November.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, great. And I guess one last one. I haven't checked this yet. Any change on the pay-to-incurred loss levels that maybe got you guys to, trend wise that kind of caused you guys to release a little less than we're used to or did we already kind of talked enough on the call and give enough disclosure on kind of what happened?\nSteve Johnston: That's a good question. I think that there was not something that would be necessarily in the pay-to-incurred ratios that had to do with this. I do think it's more of looking at some of the larger losses in the older accident years and just being prudent in that regard.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. One follow-up if I can on Phil Stefano\u2019s question. And that is in both personal and commercial auto, we saw better year-over-year underlying loss ratio improvement in the third quarter than the second quarter. And I think the general sense we've had is, there\u2019s probably more driving in the third quarter. So just hoping you\u2019d clarify whether, what drove that sequential improvement in the year-over-year improvement?\nSteve Johnston: That's a good point, Meyer. And we did see \u2013 we follow the Google Analytics in terms of what they report in driving activity that's public information. And there was an uptick in driving through the third quarter. And so that's what gives us some confidence that the actions that we're taking or taking a route and also having a good influence. We just \u2013 we don't want to be overconfident in that as we go forward and that's why we're being maybe a little bit cautious or subdued in our comments.\nMeyer Shields: No, that's fair. Was there any adjustment to the first half of the year in the auto lines in the third quarter loss ratio?\nSteve Johnston: Well, I don't have that number. We usually look at prior year developments. I'm not sure about any development from first and second quarter into third quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then a broader question or I guess it's more of a request. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in how the business interruption plays out. Is there any way we could get access to, let's say the appeals or the other documents that you'll be filing, just so we can see how that's playing out?\nSteve Johnston: That falls into me not being a lawyer, Meyer. I don't know \u2013 my lawyers \u2013 our lawyers would tell us, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure where they get it. I \u2013 you've got me on that one.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Fair enough. Not a lawyer. Thank you so much.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMark Dwelle: Yes. Good morning. I think a lot of people have been asking around the same question. Let me try it a different way, when I\u2019m looking at the personal lines segment, the accident year margin from the second quarter to the third quarter, improved by about 10 points. Five of that relates to the expense ratio, but what are the factors in the other five points of improvement? There's a similar one point improvement in the third quarter to second quarter commercial combined ratio. And again, expense ratio, a little to do with it. So I'm just trying to reconcile those two points. Why was the third quarter better than the second quarter?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. It's just a mixture of things that it's just difficult for us to separate them out. We know that we got rate, we know that that was ahead of loss cost trend. We also know that even in the personal lines, we talk about our segmentation quite a bit in the commercial lines, but they've really been working hard in the personal lines side as well. We have a new rating company that we're deploying called Cincinnati Casualty that takes our predictive modeling up to a new generation, really focuses on \u2013 really trying to write the best risks, we\u2019re getting good growth in that new writing company. So I think the mix is helping in that regard, it's just difficult for us to, in this environment to really precisely attribute the improvement to one point or another.\nMark Dwelle: Were there any notable differences in things like non-cat weather or anything like that?\nSteve Johnston: The non-cat was fairly stable. And in fact, maybe a little bit less non-cat weather in the third quarter. So I guess that could have a little bit of an explanation.\nMark Dwelle: Okay.\nSteve Spray: Mark, this is Steve Spray as well, just we've \u2013 for several quarters, we've been taking a more stringent underwriting action in personal lines in specific states. And that's we think that that is culminating, we've getting through those books and we think we're starting to see the \u2013 kind of the fruits of that labor too.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That's helpful. On commercial lines premiums, I mean, you talked about some of the submissions in new business. I guess, I would have thought \u2013 are you continuing to see a lot of premium return as a result of economic conditions, cancellations, people going out of business, whatever. I guess, I would have thought that you incurred most of the economic graph in the second quarter. And that the third quarter would have had, certainly not a negative trend, maybe not an improving trend, but it was a little bit contrary to expectations there. Could you maybe help drill down a little bit on what was going on underneath the hood?\nMike Sewell: Hey, this is Mike. Let me \u2013 maybe I'll start with that and maybe just make a few comments about audit premiums and where that has gone. And then if others want to chime in, but we've been generating during the third quarter about $3 million to $5 million per month in audit premiums. And that is down a little bit from previous quarters. If I look back at the second quarter, it was probably about $4 million to $6 million, so per month \u2013 so we're down $3-plus million or so related to the audit premium. So the audit premiums are declining as we're auditing the policies during as we're getting deeper into the pandemic period. The largest decreases in there were coming from the general liability lines, but we're also seeing decreases in the workers' comp area also. E&S audit premiums really has not been impacted so far. So we do take a look out at and we've gotten accrual for future audit. And we did decrease that accrual this quarter by $7 million so that's affecting it also. We had taken that accrual down $3 million during the second quarter so in total $10 million with most of it coming in the third quarter. So that's where it is on audit premiums, let\u2019s see if others have other comments.\nSteve Johnston: Well put, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line. My apologies, please go ahead.\nSteve Johnston: Mark, are you still on?\nOperator: Mr. Dwelle is still on.\nMark Dwelle: Sorry, I thought I was moved on. The last question that I had related to the Iowa losses, the derecho ratio losses. We understand that was a large event of fairly significant scope. And I guess, I wasn't surprised that there were losses, but $100 million single event loss for you guys is sufficiently unusual that I guess, I thought I'd ask the question in terms of, to what degree is that tally primarily IBNR or is it primarily all claims that are well in the pipeline and are in the process of being resolved?\nSteve Johnston: I would think they're in the process of being resolved, but I think Marty Mullen may have some information on that. But its just \u2013 those were hurricane type winds that went right through Iowa and right up \u2013 in towards Chicago right in the \u2013 any company that writes in the Midwest where we're going to have \u2013 we're going to have exposure. I think that we're doing a pretty good job in managing our exposure there, but from time to time, we're going to have a loss of that magnitude here in the Midwest.\nMarty Mullen: Yes, Mark. This is Marty. It\u2019s kind of an unusual event for us in the Midwest, along with those hurricane winds, the actual account for the claims was 37% for commercial lines and 62% personal lines on the account. However, when you look at the loss, 84% of the incurred loss was commercial lines. So it just hit us in an area of a belt where we had a commercial presence and the losses were of a nature where they were more severe than we might expect in the Midwest for that type of wind loss. So I think we've got a great handle on that event. Losses have been inspected, reserved, and ultimately established as you saw in the release. And I think that's one event that we can put behind us and move forward.\nMark Dwelle: I appreciate that additional color. Thanks. So that's all my questions.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Thanks for allowing me in for a follow-up. Just one follow-up, the policy being appealed, sorry, the decision being appealed in North Carolina, is it fair to say that that policy is similar to a lot of the Cincinnati Financial policies? Or is that one \u2013 would you say kind of more unique and maybe an outlier?\nSteve Johnston: Well, I think, given that we\u2019re filing an appeal and that we're in litigation on this one. I think you can understand, I just don't want to talk anything about the specifics on the advice of counsel to, the specific provisions of any of the policies.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Yes. Understood. I just \u2013 we've got some questions, so I figured I'd try and ask. Okay. Thank you again for all the insights.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mr. Johnston for closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Jason, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We continue to confidently execute our agency centered strategy bolstered by the steady improvement we see in our core book of business. The third quarter was active in terms of weather events and developments in the litigation landscape of pandemic-related business interruption claims. Recently, courts have granted some of our motions to dismiss based on lack of physical damage to property, while some others have been voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs. And the cases that have proceeded past initial motions, we continue to believe that business interruption coverage under our policy does not apply and that the courts ultimately should decide that economic loss alone without physical alteration of property does not trigger coverage under a property policy of insurance. We're confident in our legal strategy, given our understanding of the law and decisions in the majority of business interruption court cases rendered to-date. To the extent, we have setbacks, we'll continue to pursue the judicial process. We remain focused on executing our long-term plans. Net income for the third quarter of 2020 rose 95% compared with the third quarter a year ago, reflecting increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income was down $116 million for the quarter with higher catastrophe losses reducing it by $152 million more than last year on an after-tax basis. Our 103.6% property casualty combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points higher than a year ago with the elevated catastrophe losses representing 13.0 points of the increase. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe losses continue to improve and was 3.1 percentage points better than last year on a nine month basis. We see an ongoing benefit to our results from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography and likewise from segmentation of risks as we underwrite and price policies. While economic effects of the pandemic and pricing discipline continue to slow our premium growth, we believe we are growing our business profitably in our relationships with the independent agents who represent us remain very strong. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 3% in the third quarter of 2020. As a comparison growth was 6% in the second quarter and 10% for both the first quarter of the year and full year 2019. We see indicators of good underwriting and pricing discipline. Renewal pricing during the third quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for perspective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment with each one, again, experiencing mid single-digit percent range estimated average price increases. Average pricing was a little higher than in the second quarter for our largest lines of business, commercial casualty and commercial property. And those property policies renewing during the quarter averaged in the high single-digit range. New business written premium volume was again a key factor causing slower premium growth, while overall submissions from agencies for us to quote premiums for policies during the third quarter were higher than last year. For commercial risks, our underwriters declined submissions at a higher rate. The combined ratio for our commercial lines segment was 9.0 percentage points higher compared with third quarter a year ago, reflecting the 10.7 point increase in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our personal lines segment grew third quarter net written premiums by 5% and our high net worth business continues to progress as planned. The combined ratio for personal lines was 1.1 percentage points higher than the third quarter a year ago, with underlying improved performance masked by catastrophe losses that were 15.8 points higher. Our excess and surplus lines segment returned to producing an underwriting profit with an 86.7% combined ratio and grew third quarter net written premiums by 8%. As previously reported, both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global experienced significant catastrophe losses and their combined is exceeded 100%. Nearly 80% of their third quarter 2020 total catastrophe losses were from Hurricane Laura, where our agency produced business had only $4 million of catastrophe losses. Our life insurance subsidiary reported outstanding results with third quarter net income up 50% from last year and non-GAAP operating income up 31%. It grew term life insurance earned premium by 4%. My prepared remarks conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our VCR was 6.3% for the third quarter of 2020, including 5.5 percentage points contributed by improved valuation of our investment portfolio. That brought our VCR to 3.0% for the first nine months of this year. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will comment on other important areas of our financial results. Thank you, Mike. Severe weather again challenged our results, we see reasons for optimism. The dedication demonstrated by our associates is one reason I'm optimistic. While most of our headquarters associates continue to work from home, they are proving that they are equipped and motivated to continue providing outstanding service to agents and their clients. Our IT associates have continued to move technology initiatives forward. Through their efforts, we are in two awards from IVANS, a division of applied systems that were announced in September. The IVANS digital insurer program recognizes carriers that are committed to supporting independent agents needs for digital connectivity using modern technologies. We are one of only seven gold award winners in personal lines and also a silver award winner in commercial lines. Our field associates continue to work closely with agents, each time we are able to help our agents manage risk for their clients or make a policyholder hole after a covered loss. We're inspired to refocus our efforts, delivering outstanding empathetic service and building financial strength for the future. As a reminder with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hoffer. Jason, please open the call for questions. That's a key point, Phil. This is Steve Johnston and we do feel as we've mentioned that loss costs \u2013 the rates are ahead of our loss cost trends. And we think we're seeing that as we've seen continued improvement in our core book with our underlying core accident year ex-CAT combined ratio improving by 6.2 points I believe. I think the key point is it's difficult to precisely bifurcate the improvement that we've seen in the loss experience between this COVID period and the actions that we've been taking over a number of years to improve that loss experience, they're kind of blend together. And I think the key point is to look perspectively, right, making this perspective, right now our actuaries are working on what the appropriate rate level should be filed for effective dates in 2021. And so they'll be doing that on a state-by-state \u2013 very granular, state-by-state, coverage-by-coverage basis, they'll be looking at a number of quarters of past data to come up with their trends, to come up with the rates. So we're confident that the key point is as we go forward that we continue to have our rates in an adequate position and also in a position in which we can grow just as we've had here the last several years. We've been growing faster than the industry with the combined ratio lower than the industry for eight or nine years in a row now. And so, the key is I think to look forward, use of the data that we have understand that during this pandemic period there are some distortions in there and just make sure that we can hit the sweet spot with our rates next year that put us in a position to grow and grow profitably. Sure. Good question. And we remain confident in our legal position, we plan to appeal the decision, we continue to believe that the business interruption coverage under our policy in this case does not apply because there was no structural alteration to property. The prevailing view by courts around the country has been that economic loss alone doesn't qualify as direct physical damage or loss of property, which is the trigger for business interruption coverage. So there is no change in the legal strategy. And also we haven't any uptick to this point in claims being reported. Thank you. Good morning, Paul. This is Steve again. And it really was I think generated by some large losses in those prior accident years. So we still as always feel confident in the reserve that we booked our estimate our best estimate that our reserves are in a good position as they've always been. It's a little bit less than we've seen in other quarters that we're still showing favorable development year-to-date at 2.1%. And that's not that far out of the range of where we've been in previous full years. I think if we go back to 2014, we've had a couple of years where we've been in the 2% range of favorable development. So I think one thing for the quarter, just of note also when you compare it to the third quarter a year ago is workers' comp, which is a big \u2013 one of our bigger reserved lines. It developed favorably third quarter a year ago by 27%, it's still a strong number at 9.6% this quarter. But that's in terms of a difference in dollars that's a big difference between this year and last. Thank you. I failed to identify that question and yes, it's a no mass torts. Yes. I mean, we're confident in both, they're both growing nicely, as you saw from the numbers in total up about 26%, very confident in the underwriting. We know there is going to be some volatility there in terms of results, I've done an inception to date basis even through this really tough time for those lines of business, they're both at a breakeven or a little bit better than breakeven. Both are looking for ways that they can take advantage of affirming market to right new business and we feel good about both of those businesses. Thank you, Paul. Yes. I think that \u2013 this is Steve again, I think that there was some benefit from the pandemic related slow down that you would see is just we've also been working, and Steve spray may want to talk about this a little bit more. We've really been working hard to improve the core results that's been our mantra through this whole COVID period is that we want all of our people to not be distracted by everything that's out in the environment, and to really focus on improving the core book of business. And Steve can touch on some of those reasons. So we think that a lot of the improvement is independent of what we've seen from the pandemic slow down, it's just hard to split those accurately into two pieces. So going forward we're confident that we can hit the profitability targets and growth targets that we've communicated to you over the long-term. And Steve, you might want to comment on some of the specifics. Good question. And I'm not lawyer. I think our notice of appeal is due here in the first part of November. My understanding is after that the court will establish a schedule for briefing and oral arguments. And then we've \u2013 it's just uncertain after that. We don't expect a decision by the North Carolina court of appeals, maybe until \u2013 into early 2021. But that's all, like I say, I'm not a lawyer that's uncertain, I'd say just the one thing that I would know is that we'll get our notice of appeal in here in the first part of November. That's a good question. I think that there was not something that would be necessarily in the pay-to-incurred ratios that had to do with this. I do think it's more of looking at some of the larger losses in the older accident years and just being prudent in that regard. That's a good point, Meyer. And we did see \u2013 we follow the Google Analytics in terms of what they report in driving activity that's public information. And there was an uptick in driving through the third quarter. And so that's what gives us some confidence that the actions that we're taking or taking a route and also having a good influence. We just \u2013 we don't want to be overconfident in that as we go forward and that's why we're being maybe a little bit cautious or subdued in our comments. Well, I don't have that number. We usually look at prior year developments. I'm not sure about any development from first and second quarter into third quarter. That falls into me not being a lawyer, Meyer. I don't know \u2013 my lawyers \u2013 our lawyers would tell us, but I'm not sure. I'm not sure where they get it. I \u2013 you've got me on that one. Thank you. Yes. It's just a mixture of things that it's just difficult for us to separate them out. We know that we got rate, we know that that was ahead of loss cost trend. We also know that even in the personal lines, we talk about our segmentation quite a bit in the commercial lines, but they've really been working hard in the personal lines side as well. We have a new rating company that we're deploying called Cincinnati Casualty that takes our predictive modeling up to a new generation, really focuses on \u2013 really trying to write the best risks, we're getting good growth in that new writing company. So I think the mix is helping in that regard, it's just difficult for us to, in this environment to really precisely attribute the improvement to one point or another. The non-cat was fairly stable. And in fact, maybe a little bit less non-cat weather in the third quarter. So I guess that could have a little bit of an explanation. Well put, Mike. Mark, are you still on? I would think they're in the process of being resolved, but I think Marty Mullen may have some information on that. But its just \u2013 those were hurricane type winds that went right through Iowa and right up \u2013 in towards Chicago right in the \u2013 any company that writes in the Midwest where we're going to have \u2013 we're going to have exposure. I think that we're doing a pretty good job in managing our exposure there, but from time to time, we're going to have a loss of that magnitude here in the Midwest. Thank you, Mark. Well, I think, given that we're filing an appeal and that we're in litigation on this one. I think you can understand, I just don't want to talk anything about the specifics on the advice of counsel to, the specific provisions of any of the policies. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Jason, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Yes sure, and hi Mike. Steve is right, difficult to bifurcate it, but it's continued execution that we're seeing at both our field underwriters and our headquarters underwriters and segmenting the book by line of business and then by account. And just focused on getting the right rate on a risk adjusted basis account-by-account, getting more rate on those that we feel give us less opportunity for making a profit. And then really focusing on retaining that business that we feel gives us a better shot at margin. So it continues to evolve, the underwriters continue to get better and better at execution working with our agents. I think that's an advantage for us as well. Mike is the fact that there is something like this that almost 2,000 of our associates already work from their homes in the communities where our agents are making decisions locally. And we think that contact, that those deep relationships with fewer agents are going to help care to with growth and profitability. Yes. I think its normal volatility, but I would tell you this, we are still playing offense. We've got plenty of capital, we are out there looking to help our agents grow. I think it goes back to your \u2013 kind of your prior question to Mike, is we just got such a better look into the book and we continue to evolve with these pricing sophistication, pricing precision tools that our underwriters, both field and headquarters just \u2013 are executing on discipline to walk away. So that's why the declination ratio would be higher. There is many reasons why an underwriter would decline a risk, it could be distressed from prior losses, they could do an inspection and find a premises to be unacceptable. A lot of times it's just terms and conditions, and they'll get an indication of what the renewal pricing is going to be. And just say that, like we are talking before that they just don't feel that they can make a risk adjusted return, risk by risk. So we think that that's creating some \u2013 the market is kind of bouncing around, it's based on mix of business, it's based on size of account, where you'll see more firm pricing in the marketplace. So it's \u2013 that's I think creating some volatility is a fair way to state it. Mark, this is Steve Spray as well, just we've \u2013 for several quarters, we've been taking a more stringent underwriting action in personal lines in specific states. And that's we think that that is culminating, we've getting through those books and we think we're starting to see the \u2013 kind of the fruits of that labor too."

            "name": "Mike Sewell",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter 2020 investment performance was good, including investment income growing by 4% for both the quarter and on a nine month basis, matching the rate of growth for full year 2019. Dividend income rose 10% for the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2020, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $169 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3% compared with the same quarter a year ago. The pre-tax average yield was 4.03%, matching the third quarter of last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax exempt bonds during the third quarter was 3.42%. We continue to invest in the fixed-maturity portfolio with net purchases during the first nine months of the year totaling $236 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the third quarter of 2020 were again favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net gain was $645 million before tax effects, including $530 million for our equity portfolio and $115 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio net appreciated value of nearly $4.9 billion, including almost $4 billion in our equity portfolio. Cash flow continues to help us grow investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2020 was very good and generated $1.1 billion, up 27% from a year ago. Expense management remains a priority as we worked the balance strategic business investments with expense controls. The third quarter 2020 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.6 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. The pandemic has caused lower spending for several items, such as business travel. We expect some of those expenses to return to a normal rate in future quarters as governmental restrictions ease. In addition, catastrophe losses at levels closer to our historical average should cause agency profit sharing ratios to return to a more usual level. Turning to loss reserves. Our consistent approach aimed for net amount in the upper half of the actually estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the third quarter of 2020, we experienced property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 0.8% for the quarter or $11 million and was still favorable overall, but lower than a typical quarter. Each quarter, we consider new informations, such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. As we obtain and study new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. While most other major lines of business and our excess and surplus line segment, we experienced favorable reserve development during the third quarter, the updated estimates resulted in an unfavorable amount of $10 million for our commercial auto line of business. While the ratio effect for the quarter was noticeable, the total dollar amount was less than 2% of total outstanding reserves for the commercial auto. The development was driven by large losses for accident years 2018 and 2016. Because commercial auto case incurred losses for those periods were higher than we expected. We again took prudent action and kept IBNR reserves at a level that increased our estimated ultimate loss for those accident years. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first nine months of the year was favorable for the two most recent accident years with $71 million for 2019 and $42 million for 2018. In aggregate, I think there is prior to 2018 were unfavorable by $22 million. Capital management is another important company function, we believe that our financial strength remains excellent, including plenty of financial flexibility. As I always do, I'll end my prepared remarks with a summary of the third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio, property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.25. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.11. Investment income other than life insurance reduced by non-insurance operations added $0.58. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.57. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.60. And we declared $0.60 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $3.01 per share during the third quarter to a record high $60.57 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Yes. Great question. This is Mike. When looking at our favorable development for the quarter overall, obviously it was down to 0.8 points as I noted, commercial auto having really one of the larger effects of being adverse for 10 million. And some of that was really from larger losses, as I indicated in some older accident years. And so as the case incurred there, what we did is we kept the IBNR up until we see the ultimate payments for those to really play out. So current accident year is improving, it was really what we were seeing in 2018 and 2016, that was causing that. So we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. If I think about overall reserve development for the last several years, we've been running, I'll say 2.5 points to 5 points of favorable development. Full year 2017 was 4.7 on year-to-day basis right now we're at 2.1. So we're going to follow a consistent basis, let's wait and see what the fourth quarter has in store for us and follow our actuaries consistent approach. Hey, this is Mike. Let me \u2013 maybe I'll start with that and maybe just make a few comments about audit premiums and where that has gone. And then if others want to chime in, but we've been generating during the third quarter about $3 million to $5 million per month in audit premiums. And that is down a little bit from previous quarters. If I look back at the second quarter, it was probably about $4 million to $6 million, so per month \u2013 so we're down $3-plus million or so related to the audit premium. So the audit premiums are declining as we're auditing the policies during as we're getting deeper into the pandemic period. The largest decreases in there were coming from the general liability lines, but we're also seeing decreases in the workers' comp area also. E&S audit premiums really has not been impacted so far. So we do take a look out at and we've gotten accrual for future audit. And we did decrease that accrual this quarter by $7 million so that's affecting it also. We had taken that accrual down $3 million during the second quarter so in total $10 million with most of it coming in the third quarter. So that's where it is on audit premiums, let's see if others have other comments."

With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, our reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we shared in our pre-release, the second quarter was a challenging one, that we also saw reasons for optimism. That optimism stems from the proven track record of our agency centered strategy in our investment approach, plus our ability to execute our plans. Operating performance was satisfactory, considering how catastrophe affects for any given quarter can cause income variability. Net income for the quarter more than doubled the same period a year ago, and it was nice to see the positive effects of a recovering stock market during the second quarter of 2020. While non-GAAP operating income was $69 million less than the second quarter a year ago, a $79 million after-tax increase in catastrophe losses drove that change. Our 103.1% property casualty combined ratio was 6.6 percentage points higher than a year ago, with elevated catastrophe losses representing 6.5 points of the increase.\nMichael Sewell: Thank you, Steve. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment performance during the quarter provided more reasons for confidence in our proven business strategy. The pandemic has not changed how we approach investment management, and we believe that will continue to serve shareholders, policyholders and others well over the long term. Investment income continued its steady growth of 4% for the second quarter and first six months of 2020, matching the rate of growth per full year 2019. Dividend income grew 6% for the second quarter. For the first half of the year, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $149 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3%, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Average yield was 4.11%, down one basis point from the second quarter of last year. The average pre-tax yield for our total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds during the second quarter was 4.4%. We also continue to add to the fixed maturity portfolio with the net purchases during the first half of the year, totaling $107 million. Investment portfolio, valuation changes for the second quarter of 2020 were favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. Much of the fair valued decreases during the first quarter of the year in our stock portfolio recovered during the second quarter of 2020.\nSteven Johnston: Thanks, Mike. The second quarter is often the challenging one. In this year second quarter was certainly no exception. I applaud the efforts of our associates to stay focused on our insurance business, serving independent agents, underwriting risks, and paying claims, while creating and embracing new ways to do so safely, effectively and efficiently. This focus on the execution of our proven strategy will continue to help us grow profitably over time for the benefit of all stakeholders, while also creating shareholder value. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray. Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hoffer. Maria, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Hey. Good day everybody.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Zaremski: Good morning. Now, first question, I think that we're all kind of curious whether you feel the underlying loss ratio is getting actually any benefit from COVID in terms of potentially just less loss activity due to certain areas being shut down in courts and just less economic activity? That's my first question.\nSteven Johnston: I think, we would have gotten some benefit during the second quarter. I think, as I mentioned, the activity really did pick up in the second half of the second quarter. But I also think a driver of the improved performance was just the hard work that was done by our associates and the agents in terms of the improved pricing, the improved segmentation of risks, inspection of properties and basically just executing our strategy.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. So there could have been some benefit and depending how the economy shapes up as the year progresses there. It could remain a slight benefit as well. Is that fair?\nSteven Johnston: That's fair. We'll continue to monitor. Its hard to predict how things are going as we monitor activity and even look at outside sources like the Google Mobility data, which is public. It does seem that things are on the improvement. But we'll keep an eye 4on it. I just think that -- the most important thing is that we focus on our business, focus on executing our strategy, and just keep our entire associate workforce and all the agents focused on not being distracted by outside things and to really execute our proven strategy.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. Moving to the reinsurance segment, there was a -- when you pre announced there was some COVID-related business interruption, I think charges in there. Did those policies have a virus exclusion?\nSteven Johnston: For the reinsurance Cincinnati Re, they had some pandemic-related losses that we did reflect in our pre-release. They scoured their policies, looking for instances where there would be affirmative coverage. I think it resulted both from property book that they write and from the professional liability book that they write.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. So yes. Affirmative then would just mean that there wouldn't be an exclusion. It will cover the hybrid  related to COVID. Is what that means?\nSteven Johnston: It means that there would be nothing in the policy language that would say that there needed to be direct physical damage or loss to property.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And my -- just my last question, maybe I'll go back in the queue. Just kind of on the broad pricing environment, it feels like in the small and medium sized business space where or Cinci focuses on. It feels like there are certain competitors pushing for more rate than others. Do you feel there's a big need for rate, because we kind of look at how most firms are doing financially over the past couple of years. Your results seem to be in pretty decent shape, obviously, COVID, it's going to have a negative impact. Just, I guess, I'm trying to get at as -- investors have been kind of interested in the pricing trajectory, kind of moving more north than they originally expected. I think it feels like it's due to COVID uncertainty. If COVID losses end up being manageable, as I think many participants in the industry expect, including your team. Is there -- do you expect pricing to stay elevated? Or could we see the trajectory move downward?\nSteven Johnston: From what we see, the trajectory is moving upward. As we mentioned, our pricing on average has gone higher than it has been in the second quarter. And I think the key point with us as we continue to look at every policy one by one. And we want to make sure that we get an adequate risk adjusted price given everything that we bring to the table, from our predictive models, to our underwriting, to what claims brings to the table, loss inspection. We just want to make sure we understand the risks that we write, that we price that next risk that we write adequately on a risk adjusted basis. It does seem that the average of that has been moving up and we would anticipate it continues to move up. But we also focus on the distribution around that average, make sure that we're properly segmenting the book and looking at each policy on a one by one basis.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Thank you for the answers.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from of Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Newsome: I was wondering -- wonder if you could talk a little bit more detail about the components of growth. I think I've got the math right. But it looks like they're sort of counter  forces here with price increases, plus whatever the economic impact was. I'm a little bit surprised with the growth, because I would have expected there would been a little bit more of an impact from the recession and companies going out of the business. But maybe you could just focus on what you're seeing there? As well as sort of the top line and how that would likely sort of emerge in the future?\nSteven Johnston: Sure. And I think it's a continuation of the comment I had from the first quarter call is that, and I'll be still in Steve Spray's line here, and he'll probably get a chance to use it in a minute, that our business model seems to be built for this kind of disruption with the relationships that we have. And the way I described it in the last call is if you think of the economy is like a pie. That pie may shrink in times that we saw in the first half of the quarter. It may then start to grow as things rebound. But I think based on our business model, I think where the premium growth comes from is just the execution of our strategy. And we feel in all circumstances through the quarter, we were getting a little bit bigger piece of that pie than we otherwise would, because of our business model, the fact that all of our field representatives, claims representatives, everybody out there in the field, already work from their homes, in the communities with our great independent agents had the relationships in place and we were really able to react very quickly to agency needs.\nPaul Newsome: It sort of relatedly. What's going on from an agent count perspective. And has the pandemic had any impact on your efforts to expand geographically?\nSteven Johnston: We continue to appoint agents. It's very interesting the way you can do things virtually now. And really, I think we've capitalized on again, the field people really knowing their territories. They're responsible for understanding their whole territory with all the agents, not just the ones that represent us. They're able to make contact to do things virtually. And it's a big credit to Steve Spray and Angie Delaney and the people out in the field that have really kept their focus. Because it's so easy with all this distraction around us to lose focus. And there's really been a tremendous emphasis throughout the company to keep everybody focused on the business, on the task at hand and not to be distracted by everything.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you. Keep safe.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Paul. You too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning, Meyer.\nMeyer Shields: Thank you. Good morning. How are you?\nSteven Johnston: Good. How are you?\nMeyer Shields: I am doing well. Thanks. I was hoping to get a little more color on the sequential improvement in commercial casualty, specifically the accident year ex-Cat loss ratio?\nStephen Spray: Meyer, its Steve Spray. I think it just falls along with what Steve was saying earlier, is just implementation and execution of a segmentation strategy that we've got across all lines of business, obviously, we're a package underwriter. And I think the market, if anything, the market is giving us some runway, especially in the excess casualty area, that -- I would call that market access umbrella, pretty hard market. So we're seeking out opportunities there, underwriting pricing. And so, I just think it's -- again, it's basic blocking and tackling and test execution by all associates working with our agents on our segmentation strategy.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. So that means that there's no -- this is my word substantial reliance on maybe depressed actual claim count in the quarter. It sounds like there are other factors that are driving that improvement.\nStephen Spray: I would say that's true, particularly for the commercial Casualty.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. Second, basically an accounting question. For things like the domestic business interruption, defense and the credit for uncollectible premiums, is there reason to expect those to continue in the third quarter?\nSteven Johnston: I'll tackle the reserve question and turn over the premium part to Mike. Basically, we just booked our best estimate of the ultimate expense as of June 30, with the information that we have for all of the claims through June 30. So it is our best estimate of the ultimate expense number.\nMichael Sewell: And then, this is Mike. As it relates to the premiums, anything that's related to uncollectible premiums as we look at the aging, the moratoriums, as that pulls off some states have might have continued some of that. So we are watching the aging of that. So we will evaluate that at the end of each quarter that we that we report out. And so that will be adjusted accordingly at that time. In the past it's been very minor what we've had. And so this is little bit elevated. But we've shown you the numbers that we've reported.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.\nMichael Sewell: You're welcome.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Meyer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle: Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Dwelle: Good morning. First, on the workers comp line of business, there was a pretty significant decline in premiums. And I don't think that was entirely a surprise. Would you be able to kind of split that, break that that decline into sort of rate decreases, volume decreases and premium credits or something to just kind of give a flavor of maybe what some of the underlying pieces are? I'm sure there's a lot going on in that number.\nSteven Johnston: Well, I think as the key is there's a lot going on there. And we can't say that the rate changes continued in the negative mid single digit range. We had seen - I think what makes it difficult, I think we had an executing underwriting discipline in segmenting the policies up until the pandemic. And so, we'd seen a decline in exposures and had that trend going. It may have accelerated a little bit as we came into the pandemic, but I'm hard pressed to give you a percentage breakout in that regard. It's just awfully tough.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Well, I mean, the pricing is at least a little bit of a help. Turning over to the E&S line. There was a little bit of a reserve addition there. Again, I think that's -- this is the third quarter in a row. There's been at least a small addition. Please talk a little more detail about what you're seeing there? And I mean, it's unusual for you guys to have a reserve add for more than one quarter in a row. So three kind of bears some extra attention, at least in my mind?\nSteven Johnston: That's a good point, Mark and a good question. As I look at it, if you go back to our 10-K and the development happened on accident years 2016 and prior. So if we look in the K and node on reserves, for accident years 2011 through 2016, if we look at those years from the initial pick, through year end 19, they had developed favorably by $156 million. In the first half of 2020, we've added back 11 million across those accident years. So, one point is the initial picks are still where we are now versus the initial picks, we're still in a favor put favorable position. It's just we did see a modest increase in the loss payments during this calendar year on those accident years versus what we expected in some of those mature years. So we acted prudently is we always try to do. We increased our reserves by the $11 million. So we're confident in the prospects of CSU. We're confident in our best estimate of the reserves that we booked here in the second quarter. In a while the accident year, combined ratio including catastrophe losses is higher this quarter, it's still running $91.0 for the quarter and $89.4 for the full year. So that continues to be quite good, particularly, in the E&S world. And we're getting now strong double digit -- I'm sorry, we're getting strong double digit premium growth. We've constantly increased rates and that's actually accelerated in the quarter. We're doing, I think a good job of managing limits in terms of conditions. So we're confident in the prospects of the CSU, E&S business, but we did see the need as we will, when we saw that the payments in those accident years prior to 2017 pick up more than what we would have expected during the first half of the year.\nMark Dwelle: That's very helpful color. That definitely puts a frame on the situation. One more question, if I may. I know second quarter is normally your highest quarter for catastrophe losses. But this quarter was even higher than a normal high quarter. And I know there were a fair number of volume of PCS events. Maybe just talked about what you were seeing? Whether there are geographies or types of storms? Maybe just provide a little bit more depth to the Cat number to help understand that? And what made it so much higher than kind of what it had been even in other heavy second quarters?\nMichael Sewell: Yes. Let me just throw a couple of numbers. And then I think, Marty, will probably want to give a little bit more color. But thinking about the second quarter of this year, there was about 20 cats that were in there compared to about 16 last year. Two of the cats were about the same size, about 50 million a piece, and those were both occurring right there at the beginning of April. And when you look at the states that those were in, there's about 15 states or more for each of those, and so, for a particular region, it's going to be across the board. The next largest was about 27 million. And then we had the civil unrest and of course that, as you know, what's a kind of across the country. So maybe Marty got a little bit more information or color you'd like to add.\nMartin Mullen: Sure. Thanks Mike. And Mike, this is Marty Mullen. Of course, the -- just to add a little bit more color on Mike's description there. Mainly was this middle of Southeast Tennessee and Arkansas, hail events and tornadic winds. So it was really a weather events related to those two causes of loss. I'm pretty proud of the fact that during this COVID situation, we were able to respond with our Cat teams and mobilize them to those areas and handled within our Cat strategy, personal handling of those claims. Within the -- of course, the safety precautions that were given and taken care of. I think it's just an unusual that it was large hail. It hit some of the areas of our commercial footprint, which we responded to. And again, I think we handled them considering the environment we're in and the amount of the claims that were submitted. I think we responded in an outstanding fashion and we're receiving a lot of favorable comments from our agents and our policyholders. Hopefully that provides some color. Any other questions on that, Mike?\nMark Dwelle: I think that some good additional detail. I appreciate that. And that's all the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from one of Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Hey. Thanks for the follow ups. I'll ask some questions on business interruption. Is there's any change in any of the terms or conditions to add a virus exclusion on new business?\nSteven Johnston: We're continually looking at that. At this point, we do not have plans to add the virus exclusion. We feel that our standard policy language is strong. We feel confident in it. Our standard and commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. And because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss of property, we believe strongly that no coverage exists for this peril. And now, two judges, one in Michigan and one in New York recently voiced their agreement that viruses do not satisfy the direct physical damage requirement.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. And some of the reinsurers have been saying that they've been adding communicable disease exclusion. Curious, if you had any reinsurance renew lately and that language was added?\nSteven Johnston: Not that I'm aware of. No. Our general property policies renew January 1st, catastrophe and per access.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's what I thought. And lastly, sometimes investors ask about one of the Cinci's unique policy advantages is that some clients can sign up for a three-year term. Can you kind of remind us how to think about the three-year term in the context of how rate earns in?\nStephen Spray: Yes. Mike, Steve Spray. Our three-year policy provides -- first of all, we think it's a big advantage in the marketplace. We think it shows our desire for long term relationships, consistency, stability. It's always proven to be an advantage for us. Our retentions at the first and second anniversary of a three-year policy are about 10 points higher than when we actually have a renewal. As far as how the premium guarantee or excuse me, the rate guarantee works is your property, your general liability, your crime, your own marine coverages would have a great guarantee. Now the premium could go up or down based on the exposure, but the rates would be guaranteed. Obviously, your auto, your workers compensation, your umbrella, those can be adjusted annually. And I believe with renewals, and with those lines of business, like I've got my number right here that about 75% of our premiums are subject to anniversary adjustment. But the three-year policy is a hallmark of Cincinnati. And like I said, we think it's consistent with our value proposition for long term, sustained relationships.\nMike Zaremski: And just curious, do you think it has anything to do with why, I think your top lines held in better than expected that maybe agents anecdotally are kind of gravitating if the consensus is pricing is going to go higher, maybe agents are kind of gravitating more to that product? Or is it just more so, some of your competitors might be retrenching a little bit, and you guys aren't?\nStephen Spray: I think it's a good question. It's probably a little bit of both, I think. Agents and policyholders appreciate that contrary depositors belief policyholders don't like to go through the renewal process every year. I think that helps them from an efficiency standpoint. Again, it shows long term commitment, both agents and the policyholders. I think with the rising pricing, I think all of our tools we have today, like Steve said, allow us to price each risk on a risk adjusted basis at levels that we think are satisfactory for returning a profit. And I can tell you, the pricing metrics on our new business have continued to get better and better. And I think a lot of that has to do with execution, but I also think the market is providing us a little bit of lift as well.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. I understand. And thanks again for the insights.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from one of Phil Stefano of Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks and good morning.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning. Phil.\nPhil Stefano: Just following up on an earlier question around the potential frequency benefit to commercial from the economic slowdown. I guess, in my mind, and I hope this doesn't belabor the point. But the frequency impact might be more notable in a short tail line versus the long tail line? And I was hoping you could just -- to the extent you can parse out any of the commentary on the duration of the business, I'd appreciate it?\nSteven Johnston: Okay. Phil, good question. I'm not -- I'm sure I can't give a number answer to that. But I do think just as with most things, with the property, coverage in terms of business activity and so forth, you would know sooner, it's a shorter tail than the longer tail casualty lines. And I think all that, as we put out, our best estimates for reserves and so forth is considered and there's always consideration when you do reserving between stability and responsiveness. And so, I think our actuaries have done a good job there. And we've put together a quarter here with our best estimate on the reserves. And I think you bring up a good point and asking about the property versus the casualty.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. Thanks. And so in response to another earlier question, you talked about the blocking and tackling that you have with relationships with agents and how that's helping to sustained production? How can we think about this from a -- are you picking up a larger share of new business? Are the agents steering more renewals in your direction? What are the moving parts of how that that relationship benefit is manifesting?\nStephen Spray: Yes, Phil, Steve Spray again. Again, it's a little bit of both. I think what Steve said earlier really is what's happening is the fact that our business model is -- it's really good in good times, but I think it's proving to be very resilient and effective in these difficult times as well. And so the fact that we have fewer relationships, but very deep, that allows us to manage that a little better. The fact that our field associates who all have authority to make decisions, regardless of their -- for all of our disciplines, being local in the community, having fewer agencies to call on, having close relationships, I think it's creating -- we've got such great trust with each other that I think it's opening the dialogue. And I think if there's an account that another carrier takes action on, that the agent doesn't necessarily feel is appropriate. Where there. They can get a hold of us. We're in the community. We're responsive. Our field associates are coming up with all different kinds of ways to reach out to agencies and be creative, be present. So I think that's what's given us lift. So I think it is some that's new-new, we would call it, new to the agency new to us. And I think we're getting opportunities on some other carriers renewals as well.\nSteven Johnston: And Phil, I would just -- I agree with everything Steve said, and would just add commentary as we move through the quarter. In new business, as you can see from our numbers versus other quarters was impacted. But while the submissions from our agencies in the first half of the second quarter were down. When we got into the second half of the second quarter, we actually saw more submissions coming in than we had in the second half of the second quarter a year ago.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. That kind of leads me to my last question. I know it's early, but is there any July read on how that submission activity has trended. And I'm wondering if we've had a pullback in some states now as the shelter in place comes back into play. Has that put any initial pressure on submission activity?\nSteven Johnston: I haven't seen it. In fact, I really hesitate to comment on the third quarter yet, since so much is in flux still. But I haven't seen the pullback. But that's not to say that it wouldn't be there. And there's a bit of a pipeline as business comes in. So I should really probably be pretty careful about commenting at all on the third quarter here.\nPhil Stefano: Not necessarily. It's unfair to ask you. But I appreciate the attempt. Thanks so much guys, and be well.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from on of Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Let me just ask. This is for . I apologize for forgetting it. But given the overall trend of the economy towards reopening, Can you give us some insight in terms of how business disruption in claim filings and I mean, here, again, domestically, how those trended over the course of the quarter?\nSteven Johnston: We don't comment a lot on the detail of the number of claims or the sequence of individual claims over the quarter there. I would say they did trail off towards the as time went on.\nMartin Mullen: Meyer, this is Marty Mullen. Here's a comment. I think what we're seeing in some of the courts is, they're focusing on criminal prosecutions and follow-up, because those that take priority. Because during the COVID, shut down, the courts were inactive. So the criminal cases I think, in most dockets are taking precedent, precedent over the civil cases, not saying that they aren't receiving attention, but I know there's a lot of energy by the courts to make sure that they get current on the criminal prosecutions first.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Ron Bobman of Capital Returns.\nRon Bobman: Hi, gentlemen, hope everyone's well. Sounds like it. I was wondering with all the stress in the world and particularly in your markets. Are you seeing any reduction in claim settlement values?\nSteven Johnston: I have not noticed that, Ron. \nRon Bobman: Okay. Thank you.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, there appears to be no further questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Johnston for an additional or closing remarks.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Maria. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Investment performance during the quarter provided more reasons for confidence in our proven business strategy. The pandemic has not changed how we approach investment management, and we believe that will continue to serve shareholders, policyholders and others well over the long term. Investment income continued its steady growth of 4% for the second quarter and first six months of 2020, matching the rate of growth per full year 2019. Dividend income grew 6% for the second quarter. For the first half of the year, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $149 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3%, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Average yield was 4.11%, down one basis point from the second quarter of last year. The average pre-tax yield for our total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds during the second quarter was 4.4%. We also continue to add to the fixed maturity portfolio with the net purchases during the first half of the year, totaling $107 million. Investment portfolio, valuation changes for the second quarter of 2020 were favorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. Much of the fair valued decreases during the first quarter of the year in our stock portfolio recovered during the second quarter of 2020. And then, this is Mike. As it relates to the premiums, anything that's related to uncollectible premiums as we look at the aging, the moratoriums, as that pulls off some states have might have continued some of that.

I think it just falls along with what Steve was saying earlier, is just implementation and execution of a segmentation strategy that we've got across all lines of business, obviously, we're a package underwriter. And I think the market, if anything, the market is giving us some runway, especially in the excess casualty area, that -- I would call that market access umbrella, pretty hard market. So we're seeking out opportunities there, underwriting pricing. And so, I just think it's -- again, it's basic blocking and tackling and test execution by all associates working with our agents on our segmentation strategy. I would say that's true, particularly for the commercial Casualty. Yes. Mike, Steve Spray. Our three-year policy provides -- first of all, we think it's a big advantage in the marketplace. We think it shows our desire for long term relationships, consistency, stability. It's always proven to be an advantage for us. Our retentions at the first and second anniversary of a three-year policy are about 10 points higher than when we actually have a renewal. As far as how the premium guarantee or excuse me, the rate guarantee works is your property, your general liability, your crime, your own marine coverages would have a great guarantee. Now the premium could go up or down based on the exposure, but the rates would be guaranteed. Obviously, your auto, your workers compensation, your umbrella, those can be adjusted annually. And I believe with renewals, and with those lines of business, like I've got my number right here that about 75% of our premiums are subject to anniversary adjustment. But the three-year policy is a hallmark of Cincinnati. And like I said, we think it's consistent with our value proposition for long term, sustained relationships. I think it's a good question. It's probably a little bit of both, I think. Agents and policyholders appreciate that contrary depositors belief policyholders don't like to go through the renewal process every year. I think that helps them from an efficiency standpoint. Again, it shows long term commitment, both agents and the policyholders. I think with the rising pricing, I think all of our tools we have today, like Steve said, allow us to price each risk on a risk adjusted basis at levels that we think are satisfactory for returning a profit. And I can tell you, the pricing metrics on our new business have continued to get better and better. And I think a lot of that has to do with execution, but I also think the market is providing us a little bit of lift as well. Yes, Phil, Steve Spray again. Again, it's a little bit of both. I think what Steve said earlier really is what's happening is the fact that our business model is -- it's really good in good times, but I think it's proving to be very resilient and effective in these difficult times as well. And so the fact that we have fewer relationships, but very deep, that allows us to manage that a little better. The fact that our field associates who all have authority to make decisions, regardless of their -- for all of our disciplines, being local in the community, having fewer agencies to call on, having close relationships, I think it's creating -- we've got such great trust with each other that I think it's opening the dialogue. And I think if there's an account that another carrier takes action on, that the agent doesn't necessarily feel is appropriate. Where there. They can get a hold of us. We're in the community. We're responsive. Our field associates are coming up with all different kinds of ways to reach out to agencies and be creative, be present. So I think that's what's given us lift. So I think it is some that's new-new, we would call it, new to the agency new to us. And I think we're getting opportunities on some other carriers renewals as well."

            "content": "Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we shared in our pre-release, the second quarter was a challenging one, that we also saw reasons for optimism. That optimism stems from the proven track record of our agency centered strategy in our investment approach, plus our ability to execute our plans. Operating performance was satisfactory, considering how catastrophe affects for any given quarter can cause income variability. Net income for the quarter more than doubled the same period a year ago, and it was nice to see the positive effects of a recovering stock market during the second quarter of 2020. While non-GAAP operating income was $69 million less than the second quarter a year ago, a $79 million after-tax increase in catastrophe losses drove that change. Our 103.1% property casualty combined ratio was 6.6 percentage points higher than a year ago, with elevated catastrophe losses representing 6.5 points of the increase. Thanks, Mike. The second quarter is often the challenging one. In this year second quarter was certainly no exception. I applaud the efforts of our associates to stay focused on our insurance business, serving independent agents, underwriting risks, and paying claims, while creating and embracing new ways to do so safely, effectively and efficiently. This focus on the execution of our proven strategy will continue to help us grow profitably over time for the benefit of all stakeholders, while also creating shareholder value. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray. Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hoffer. Maria, please open the call for questions. Good morning, Mike. I think, we would have gotten some benefit during the second quarter. I think, as I mentioned, the activity really did pick up in the second half of the second quarter. But I also think a driver of the improved performance was just the hard work that was done by our associates and the agents in terms of the improved pricing, the improved segmentation of risks, inspection of properties and basically just executing our strategy. That's fair. We'll continue to monitor. Its hard to predict how things are going as we monitor activity and even look at outside sources like the Google Mobility data, which is public. It does seem that things are on the improvement. But we'll keep an eye 4on it. I just think that -- the most important thing is that we focus on our business, focus on executing our strategy, and just keep our entire associate workforce and all the agents focused on not being distracted by outside things and to really execute our proven strategy. For the reinsurance Cincinnati Re, they had some pandemic-related losses that we did reflect in our pre-release. They scoured their policies, looking for instances where there would be affirmative coverage. I think it resulted both from property book that they write and from the professional liability book that they write. It means that there would be nothing in the policy language that would say that there needed to be direct physical damage or loss to property. From what we see, the trajectory is moving upward. As we mentioned, our pricing on average has gone higher than it has been in the second quarter. And I think the key point with us as we continue to look at every policy one by one. And we want to make sure that we get an adequate risk adjusted price given everything that we bring to the table, from our predictive models, to our underwriting, to what claims brings to the table, loss inspection. We just want to make sure we understand the risks that we write, that we price that next risk that we write adequately on a risk adjusted basis. It does seem that the average of that has been moving up and we would anticipate it continues to move up. But we also focus on the distribution around that average, make sure that we're properly segmenting the book and looking at each policy on a one by one basis. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, Paul. Sure. And I think it's a continuation of the comment I had from the first quarter call is that, and I'll be still in Steve Spray's line here, and he'll probably get a chance to use it in a minute, that our business model seems to be built for this kind of disruption with the relationships that we have. And the way I described it in the last call is if you think of the economy is like a pie. That pie may shrink in times that we saw in the first half of the quarter. It may then start to grow as things rebound. But I think based on our business model, I think where the premium growth comes from is just the execution of our strategy. And we feel in all circumstances through the quarter, we were getting a little bit bigger piece of that pie than we otherwise would, because of our business model, the fact that all of our field representatives, claims representatives, everybody out there in the field, already work from their homes, in the communities with our great independent agents had the relationships in place and we were really able to react very quickly to agency needs. We continue to appoint agents. It's very interesting the way you can do things virtually now. And really, I think we've capitalized on again, the field people really knowing their territories. They're responsible for understanding their whole territory with all the agents, not just the ones that represent us. They're able to make contact to do things virtually. And it's a big credit to Steve Spray and Angie Delaney and the people out in the field that have really kept their focus. Because it's so easy with all this distraction around us to lose focus. And there's really been a tremendous emphasis throughout the company to keep everybody focused on the business, on the task at hand and not to be distracted by everything. Thank you, Paul. You too. Good morning, Meyer. Good. How are you? I'll tackle the reserve question and turn over the premium part to Mike. Basically, we just booked our best estimate of the ultimate expense as of June 30, with the information that we have for all of the claims through June 30. So it is our best estimate of the ultimate expense number. Thank you, Meyer. Good morning, Mark. Well, I think as the key is there's a lot going on there. And we can't say that the rate changes continued in the negative mid single digit range. We had seen - I think what makes it difficult, I think we had an executing underwriting discipline in segmenting the policies up until the pandemic. And so, we'd seen a decline in exposures and had that trend going. It may have accelerated a little bit as we came into the pandemic, but I'm hard pressed to give you a percentage breakout in that regard. It's just awfully tough. That's a good point, Mark and a good question. As I look at it, if you go back to our 10-K and the development happened on accident years 2016 and prior. So if we look in the K and node on reserves, for accident years 2011 through 2016, if we look at those years from the initial pick, through year end 19, they had developed favorably by $156 million. In the first half of 2020, we've added back 11 million across those accident years. So, one point is the initial picks are still where we are now versus the initial picks, we're still in a favor put favorable position. It's just we did see a modest increase in the loss payments during this calendar year on those accident years versus what we expected in some of those mature years. So we acted prudently is we always try to do. We increased our reserves by the $11 million. So we're confident in the prospects of CSU. We're confident in our best estimate of the reserves that we booked here in the second quarter. In a while the accident year, combined ratio including catastrophe losses is higher this quarter, it's still running $91.0 for the quarter and $89.4 for the full year. So that continues to be quite good, particularly, in the E&S world. And we're getting now strong double digit -- I'm sorry, we're getting strong double digit premium growth. We've constantly increased rates and that's actually accelerated in the quarter. We're doing, I think a good job of managing limits in terms of conditions. So we're confident in the prospects of the CSU, E&S business, but we did see the need as we will, when we saw that the payments in those accident years prior to 2017 pick up more than what we would have expected during the first half of the year. We're continually looking at that. At this point, we do not have plans to add the virus exclusion. We feel that our standard policy language is strong. We feel confident in it. Our standard and commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. And because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss of property, we believe strongly that no coverage exists for this peril. And now, two judges, one in Michigan and one in New York recently voiced their agreement that viruses do not satisfy the direct physical damage requirement. Not that I'm aware of. No. Our general property policies renew January 1st, catastrophe and per access. Good morning. Phil. Okay. Phil, good question. I'm not -- I'm sure I can't give a number answer to that. But I do think just as with most things, with the property, coverage in terms of business activity and so forth, you would know sooner, it's a shorter tail than the longer tail casualty lines. And I think all that, as we put out, our best estimates for reserves and so forth is considered and there's always consideration when you do reserving between stability and responsiveness. And so, I think our actuaries have done a good job there. And we've put together a quarter here with our best estimate on the reserves. And I think you bring up a good point and asking about the property versus the casualty. And Phil, I would just -- I agree with everything Steve said, and would just add commentary as we move through the quarter. In new business, as you can see from our numbers versus other quarters was impacted. But while the submissions from our agencies in the first half of the second quarter were down. When we got into the second half of the second quarter, we actually saw more submissions coming in than we had in the second half of the second quarter a year ago. I haven't seen it. In fact, I really hesitate to comment on the third quarter yet, since so much is in flux still. But I haven't seen the pullback. But that's not to say that it wouldn't be there. And there's a bit of a pipeline as business comes in. So I should really probably be pretty careful about commenting at all on the third quarter here. Thank you. You too. We don't comment a lot on the detail of the number of claims or the sequence of individual claims over the quarter there. I would say they did trail off towards the as time went on. I have not noticed that, Ron. Thank you. Thank you, Maria. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Have a great day."

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel of Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We knew people everywhere, face many challenges during this period of turbulence and we sincerely hope that the things important to you improve overtime. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you will first hear from Steve Johnston, President and Chief Executive Officer; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marty Mullen; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These Forward-Looking Statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. As I reflect on the past quarter, I find myself feeling thankful. I applaud the efforts of our healthcare industry to stand on the frontlines of the pandemic, working tirelessly to protect us all. I thank our associates for their dedication and creativity to keep our business moving forward, and I appreciate working with the best independent agents in the business. This pandemic has illuminated the leadership and professionalism they deliver to their clients, guiding them through much uncertainty. I\u2019m thankful to be a part of this noble industry. Spring storms didn\u2019t relent in the face of the pandemic and we stood ready to respond helping policy holders rebuild what was lost. I\u2019m undeterred by the recent volatility we have experienced in the stock market, even though that volatility led to negative total revenues and a net loss for us in the first quarter.\nMichael Sewell: Thank you Steve and thanks for all of you joining us today. Some reviewing our results may be startled by our net loss and negative total revenues. Reporting negative total revenues is quite unusual, but has been possible since 2018, when new accounting rules from the FASB required changes in the fair value of equity securities to be reported through the income statement resulting in unnecessary variability. The fair value of equity securities, we continue to hold on March 31 decreased during the first quarter by $1.6 billion before taxes, that offset revenues from premiums and investment income, which grew 9% and 5% respectively from a year-ago. On an after tax basis, the equity portfolio decrease had a negative income effect of nearly $1.3 billion and offset all of the income generated by our operations. It is interesting to compare that to the first quarter of last year when a strong stock market boosted net income by $550 million in similar to last year\u2019s fourth quarter with a positive effect of $428 million. Volatility like this in revenues and net income does not seem to give a clear picture to investors trying to understand the business of operations of insurance. Changes in fair value of equity security still held are better reported and other comprehensive income consistent with fixed maturity securities, where it still affects book value and investors can see it more clearly. Hopefully FASB will revisit this in the near future. Turning to more customary topics. Investment income continue to grow a 5% for the first quarter of 2020, including 15% growth for dividend income. Net purchases of stocks during the quarter, totaled a $125 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio rose 1% compared with the same quarter a year-ago. The pre-tax average yield was 4.04% down 11 basis points from the first quarter of last year. While we continue to invest in bonds, we reported first quarter net sales of $6 million, as many bonds we purchased near the end of the quarter had not settled as of March 31st. As we reported in our 10-Q, the average pre-tax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds was roughly 74 basis points lower than the same period in 2019, further pressuring interest income. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the first quarter of 2020 were unfavorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net decrease was just over $2 billion before tax effects, including $324 million for our bond portfolio.\nSteven Johnston: Thanks Mike. There is another point about future loss experience uncertainty that I want to emphasize. And we have heard investors ask related questions on other calls. Virtually all of our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property, because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss to property no coverage exists for this peril, rendering and exclusion unnecessary. For this reason most of our standard market, commercial property policies in states where we actively write business do not contain a specific exclusion for COVID-19, while we will evaluate each claim based on the specific facts and circumstances involved, our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Throughout our Company\u2019s  (Ph) history, we have weathered many storms and we have the technology, the risk management expertise and the financial strength to weather this one. We have the best people in the industry. Together, we will take care of our Cincinnati family, protecting the health of our associates, serving agents and policy holders and emerging as an organization with new strengths to carry us forward. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, Theresa Hopper, and Ken Stecher. Please open the call for questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning Mike.\nMike Zaremski: First question is kind of beyond on business interruption. I guess the stock market investors kind of appear to be taking the language you offered us about your policies. Most of them are not having a specific virus exclusion. I think, everyone does appreciate that the policies need to be - are triggered by property damage and COVID doesn\u2019t constitute property damage. But given if I\u2019m correct in interpreting language that, most of your policies don\u2019t have the virus exclusion. Are your customers filing business disruption claims, trying to kind of stating that the policies don\u2019t have the virus exclusion, basically is there more risk of potential litigation because of that?\nSteven Johnston: Mike, I think like every other insurance company, we expect that, we are going to receive our fair share of COVID-19 claims. I think, that is just natural. But, we feel strong in our position with our coverage language.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. Switching gears to stock buyback. And I might have missed that in the prepared remarks, are you continuing to buy back stock in the second quarter or are you kind of taking a pause given the more uncertain business environment for all in industry?\nMichael Sewell: Yes. This is Mike. So, and we will likely not and we will not be buying for the rest of the year. We have always said, or I have always said, Steve has always said that we have a maintenance, buyback philosophy. And so, we have done that again so far this year. So, even though, it is a little higher that we bought back here in the first quarter, two and a half million shares. When you look at it overtime, we have been running out a million shares that is kind of really required and I was looking back. The maintenance that we did this year, actually got us back to the same level of shares that we were about 10-years ago. So we have achieved what we have done and I probably do not see any other buybacks through the remainder of the year as part of our maintenance program.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. And one last one, if I may, going back to this interruption. Given you stated that there are some claims coming through and don\u2019t expect to pay them though and everyone in the industry, other your peers are also seeing those claims of being attempted to be made. So should we at least expect some type of provision later in the year to account for some types of adjustment costs or potential legal costs or should we just kind of assume this is a anonymous material event in the near-term?\nSteven Johnston: I think we are still in the middle of this storm, and I think as more facts and circumstances come out here in the second quarter and third quarter, we will provide that information to the extended material.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And just, maybe lastly, if you are able to answer this. Is there a general rule of thumb in terms of what percentage of property policies have a business interruption endorsements? If you could answer that. Thanks.\nSteven Johnston: Yes. It is about half, Mike.\nStephen Spray: Mike, this is Steve Spray and Steve is right. It is about half of our policies where the policy holder increases their limit. Our standard property form like many others, includes a sub-limit automatically for business income of 25,000.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.\nRonBobman: Hi, thanks a lot. Hi, Steve. Hi team. I had a question on the property cat reinsurance treaty. What the $800 million tower, what payrolls are covered by that treaty?\nSteven Johnston: Well, I would say that there is not a virus exclusion in there.\nRon Bobman: I\u2019m sorry, I just so I understand. So it covers all payrolls?\nSteven Johnston: It is generally a property, it is a property catastrophe risk policy. And they follow our fortunes and we would have a virus exclusion in there.\nRon Bobman: Now the one other sort of strange twist will be if it ever becomes relevant, which I think it is low module, but what are the implications of the hours clause on that treaty and whether the pandemic and losses from it would be considered a single event or multiple events or somewhere in between?\nSteven Johnston: Yes, that would be determined. If we ever got to that point, the hours clause for us as 120 hours, but our expectation is that we wouldn\u2019t be in that position.\nRon Bobman: Okay. And any thoughts or plans to modify policy wordings on the BI subject?\nSteven Johnston: I don\u2019t think so at this point, but that is something again is second quarter, third quarter here evolves. We will keep an eye on things and we feel strong in our wording. We feel that an exclusion to those policies would just be belts and suspenders. And we feel that the policies do require physical damage or loss to the property.\nRon Bobman: Okay. Thanks a lot. Best of luck with this.\nSteven Johnston: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will comes from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC.\nMark Dwelle: Good morning. First I wanted to follow-up on a comment which Steve Spray made just a minute or two ago about sub-limits related to BI endorsements. Could you just go through that again? \nStephen Spray: Sure. Mark. This is Steve Sprite. Our commercial standard property policies automatically include a sub-limit of $25,000 of business income. And then obviously like many other coverages, policy holders can elect to increase that limit based on their exposure. So it is not uncommon for property policies to include automatically a sub-limit for business income across the industry, and ours just happens to be 25,000. But again, even for that 25,000, you still need to have the direct physical damage or loss in the insuring agreement to trigger coverage.\nMark Dwelle: So just to make sure, I\u2019m following the full flow of information, you had said initially that around 50% of the typical policies have a BI endorsement and then within those, the sub-limit which start at 25,000, and then to the extent somebody bought it up, it would be to whatever level they chose to pay an incremental premium to get a higher limit.\nStephen Spray: That is correct.\nMark Dwelle: Got it. Okay, that is helpful. Changing gears a little bit, in the quarter there was some continued reserve pressure relays the commercial auto, there was also a first time in a while, a little bit or second quarter in a row rather some pressure in the ENS segment on reserving. Can you just comment a little bit what we are seeing there and how the reserves are fairing?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. We obviously feel good in our reserve position overall. We have developed favorably for 30-years now and we look at each line as it stands on its own. We do our best to make our best estimate. We think with the commercial auto, given the way it is been over the past several years, given what we saw with some of the paid trends that it was appropriate to do what we did with the commercial auto. In terms of the ENS, again, we feel strong in terms of our best estimate there. We did take a look at what was going on with defense and in cost containment, and we looked at that just across the casually lines for the standard and the ENS. For the standard we have asked some favorable movements and paid losses for the excess and surplus lines. We saw that go up by about a half a percent. And so, we just felt it appropriate to take the prudent action there, but we do feel good with the best estimate we have got in place.\nMark Dwelle: What do the rate increases look like in each of those segments, commercial auto and ENS in general?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. For the commercial auto, we have been getting in the mid single-digits this past quarter. I think with the ENS, the way I would describe that, it is been more that the lower single-digits overtime, but we have increased that quarter-after-quarter, month-after-month for years now. It is just a nice steady, keeping up if not exceeding inflationary trends and producing excellent combined ratios over long periods of time. It is just been a very steady approach there.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. And then, I know you spend a lot of time in the sales offices and with the field underwriting staff and whatnot, can you just give us a sense of your customers and what they are doing, how they are changing policies, your own just anecdotal impression of how many people or what proportion are struggling to pay and so forth. Just trying to kind of get them as mosaic of what you are seeing on the ground amongst your small and mid market customer base.\nStephen Spray: Yes. Sure. It is all over the board there Mark. And we are being extremely flexible as you would expect with our policy holders in that. So, many of our liability policies are based on payroll and sales. We are working with our customers to reduce those exposures here, midterms, so that it will reduce their premium. They are contacting us with some concerns on being able to pay. We have instituted, we are putting a moratorium on cancellations for nonpayment of premium up until May 31st or later, if a state mandates it. The key here is, we want to help our policy holders and our agents through this and anything we can do to help that we will. I would say it is probably still a little too early to understand or have a full picture on premium collections over the long pole. So far, things have been good.\nMark Dwelle: Most of your underwriting is not really in areas that would have been particularly hard hit by virus outbreak itself. I mean, how to best to ask the question. But I mean, are you seeing regional differences? Or is what you are seeing just generally kind of across the base?\nStephen Spray: You mean, as far as the collections?\nMark Dwelle: Collections, pressure on wanting to change business, or change policy terms and so forth? I guess I\u2019m trying to get out as if you are seeing any regional variation that is notable or exceptional?\nStephen Spray: Yes, I think this is a pretty broad based. We are not as far in the commercialized side which would be most impacted here. We newer to the northeast, which would certainly be more impacted by COVID. But I would say as far as the collections and individuals wanting to put layup credits on their fleet or reduce their exposures on their liability for payroll and sales. I would say that is pretty much across the board.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Thank you for all the answers and best of luck going forward. Thanks.\nStephen Spray: Sure. Thank you.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from line Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks. Good morning. Mike. I think your comments you mentioned that personal auto driving was down and that is accordingly so it is clean frequency. Can you just kind of fit in terms of what you are seeing with commercial auto?\nStephen Spray: Yes, this is Steve Spray. I would say we are seeing a little reduced frequency in commercial auto but it is still too early to tell on that. That is something that we will probably have to report back to you at a later date. Something we are watching closely. I do think that commercial auto and personal auto are an apples and oranges here, because so many businesses are still up in running. I think everyone knows that almost 40% of our GL premium is in contractor classes. Construction, a knock on wood so far has been able to continue for the most part across the country. So those vehicles are still out operating. One of the other areas that we are helping our policyholders on is many restaurants or other retail businesses have moved to a delivery to help their communities. And we are extending the average. It is adding exposure to us but it is something that we feel is the right thing to do. And so our exposures are going up on the higher non-owned commercial auto from delivery standpoint that we didn\u2019t anticipate at the beginning of the policy period.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, no, that makes perfect sense. Can you give us your sort of long-term historical perspective on the influence of declining unemployment on workers compensation frequently?\nSteven Johnston: Yes, there is a couple of ways to look at that Meyer. Especially coming out of the financial crisis, there could be the thought before somebody gets laid off, they get injured. And there could be an increase in frequency. Offsetting that there could be with employers as they determine which employees they keep, they tend to keep the more experienced ones that would be safer. I think also with the another consideration would be what we are seeing with unemployment insurance and some of the increases in the payments for unemployment insurance, I think would have a mitigating effect there too. So, I think it is too early to really tell, but in terms of as you ask the long-term perspective, those would be some of the considerations that we would be looking at.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk about premium volumes and the way it feels like it is been messaged by some peer is that, we will get a short-term shock and written premiums and second quarter, third quarter may have some pressures. I was just hoping you could kind of talk about it from what you are seeing. I don\u2019t know to the extent that the distribution is a little more reliant upon face-to-face contacts with agents to the extent that the shelter-in-place may go longer than some are expecting. How do you feel about the business trajectory, I mean, retention likely to go up, but new business likely to, maybe qualitatively you can just help us think about directionally what this might be.\nSteven Johnston: Yes. I think for the long-term Phil, our model is working extremely well. As Steve Spray likes to say, it is built for a situation like this and now I will let him have a chance to comment, but I think, we are just naturally going to see submissions go down as an economy is in the shape that it is in. What we are seeing though is, as that pie shrinks, we seem to be getting a bigger piece of the pie. And I think as we come out of this, all the works that we are doing with our agency facing model, with the great relationships, our field people, every discipline, working in the communities, with the agencies and so forth. I think will come out with that bigger piece of the pie as the pie grows. So, I feel for the long pool, we are in good shape. I would invite Steve to add anything if he wants.\nStephen Spray: I think that is perfect. I spent 10-years in the field, Phil and I do say that, if any company is built for this, it is Cincinnati Insurance Company. Having as few agencies as we do, having that limited franchise, I think helps us. We have fewer relationships to manage. We have deep relationships with each of them. Our field strategy taking the company out into the communities where our agents and policy holders are. 1,900 of our, 5,200 associates work from their homes in the communities, where our agents are and they have since 1950. So, it sets us up well there in the community deep relationships able to handle claims just like we literally are handling storm claims as we sit here and speak today, just delivering on that promise. So, I agree with Steve. I think that, submission counts, although they have dipped, they have flattened in that dip too. Our hit ratio has got a bit, and I think, like Steve said, I think our shot at a bigger piece of the pie, because of those deeper relationships and being local with our agents is key.\nPhil Stefano: Understood. Thank you. And to revisit the workers\u2019 compensation conversation just for a minute, I mean it is a line that is clearly has pricing pressure. We have seen favorable development slowed down, just given some of the maybe regulatory changes that are happening in workers\u2019 compensation and the potential for increasing loss cost. Does it feel like that the COVID impact maybe something that changes the trajectory of this line of business?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. I think, it would. I think we are in a pretty good position here with workers comp only being about 5% of our premiums. Our largest state here, Ohio is a monopolistic state fund. We really don\u2019t have any California workers comp to speak of. It is very small. And we have been disciplined, I feel in terms of as we have seen the pricing soften. We haven\u2019t done crazy things with commissions. We have done our best to, as I mentioned in the opening comments to really segment the book, make sure that we are getting rate on the ones that need it and that we are retaining the ones that highest profit potential. And I do think that I would expect that there would be some firming given the points that you made as we go forward.\nPhil Stefano: Got it. Okay. And last one, I will ask. And I\u2019m not quite sure how to ask. So I apologize if this comes out awkward. But it seems like the messaging is our primary policies do not have an explicit virus exclusion. But it is not something to worry about. It is not notable, but our reinsurance program doesn\u2019t have a virus exclusion. And that is something that is notable. Like I guess to the extent I wanted to play devil\u2019s advocate that might be a contrary there. Can you help me understand that.\nSteven Johnston: Yes. And I\u2019m very glad that you brought it up actually. Because I think maybe I was thinking when somebody was zagging. And when I talked about a reinsurance program, I was talking about what we see to our reinsurers, not what we would assume. What we would see to our reinsurer. So, it is basically that they are following the fortunes of us in terms of we are aligned with our policy provisions with the reinsurance that we seed to.\nPhil Stefano: Okay, so one way or another, so goes the primary policy. So goes to reinsurance section.\nSteven Johnston: Yes.\nPhil Stefano: Understood. Okay, that make sense. Thank you, sir. \nSteven Johnston: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning, folks. I wanted to ask a little bit more about what might be happening with retentions and sales. My sense from other conference calls is that at least in the last couple weeks of March, and maybe in April, agents in general are just not selling much. And they are also not pulling business from other carriers as well. So I think there is the presumption that we will see retentions go up and new sales go down. Is that kind of what you are seeing on the margin here or not?\nStephen Spray: Paul. I think that is very steep. And I think it is still probably a bit early. But I think your take on it is what we are hearing in the market place as well. I can tell you, though, that we are still active trying to write new business where maybe other carriers aren\u2019t able to maybe meet the needs of the agent of the policyholder or that we feel that we can write that risk on a risk adjusted basis and make margin. But I think your general sense is right and something we are going to have to watch going forward. But that is kind of the feedback we are getting from the agents as well. It is just that the new business has slowed a bit, but retentions are real solid.\nPaul Newsome: Outside of - options, and I\u2019m curious if you are seeing or have any anticipation of increased liability claims in things like your liability and do you know, et cetera move I mean, I\u2019m thinking, lawsuits for nursing homes and hospitals and doctors and factories that needed to protect their workers enough. Is there any sense that some of that may be happening or it is just too early?\nSteven Johnston: I think it is too early. I think that we are just in unprecedented times here, and I think some of that will play out here over the next quarters that what we are seeing now. We are not really seeing that.\nStephen Spray: Paul, this is Steve Spray. I would just to what Steve was talking about earlier on workers\u2019 compensation is being only 5% of our premiums. And on top of that is, we don\u2019t have a large account number or a large policy number of municipalities or hospitals where we write the workers\u2019 compensation or on the small book of skilled healthcare facilities that we do have. It would be rare that we would write the workers\u2019 compensation. So, exposure to first responders for us, I think is going to be minimal as well.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nSteven Johnston: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: . The next question will come from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney Montgomery.\nLarry Greenberg: Good morning.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning Larry.\nLarry Greenberg: We are not in South Carolina, but that is okay.\nSteven Johnston: We are not there yet.\nLarry Greenberg: Yes. So, I think that statement on business interruption was that, most of your standard market policies don\u2019t have the virus exclusion. I\u2019m just curious where your policies would have a virus exclusion.\nStephen Spray: Yes. Larry, Steve Spray. That would typically be in States where we are inactive and where we have filed straight ISO. So we don\u2019t have agents on the ground. We don\u2019t have associates there. So, where we would write a secondary coverages outside of our active state, so inactive states where we file straight ISO, we would have some -.\nLarry Greenberg: Got it.\nSteven Johnston: And also on our excess and surplus lines company on CSU, they have that as well as the binders we ride out of the Lloyds.\nLarry Greenberg: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just an accounting questions, how you are going to treat the stay-at-home premium credits coming up, whether that is going to be a premium offset or will you account for it in the losses line?\nMichael Sewell: Yes. This is Mike Sewell. It will be in the expense line as of right now. We understand, there might be a group, NAIC and others that might be looking at that issue, but as of right now, it will be an expense.\nLarry Greenberg: Great. Thank you very much.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Larry.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Thanks for fitting me back in. Just a follow-up on reinsurance. Can you remind us to the extent for some reason, some business interruption policies or just COVID writing claims were required to be paid out. How do we think about where to reinsurance program would start succinct in those payments?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. Our program attaches it $100 million, which is why we feel confident that we won\u2019t get there. But it is nice to know if there would be some legislative action or something that is just untested, unanticipated that we have the program and that we are in the falls of fortunate situations.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, perfect. That is all I have. Thank you, gentlemen.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: There is no further audio questions showing. We get back to the closing remarks.\nSteven Johnston: Okay, thank you very much, Nicole. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope some of you will join us for our first ever virtual shareholder meeting on Saturday, May the 2nd at 9:30 AM. Eastern. While we intend to resume in person meeting until 2021. We felt moving the meeting online was the best way to keep shareholders and associates safe during the pandemic. Please visit www.cincin.com for details on how to register for the meeting. If you can\u2019t make the meeting, we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Thank you all very much and have a great day.\nOperator: This does concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you Steve and thanks for all of you joining us today. Some reviewing our results may be startled by our net loss and negative total revenues. Reporting negative total revenues is quite unusual, but has been possible since 2018, when new accounting rules from the FASB required changes in the fair value of equity securities to be reported through the income statement resulting in unnecessary variability. The fair value of equity securities, we continue to hold on March 31 decreased during the first quarter by $1.6 billion before taxes, that offset revenues from premiums and investment income, which grew 9% and 5% respectively from a year-ago. On an after tax basis, the equity portfolio decrease had a negative income effect of nearly $1.3 billion and offset all of the income generated by our operations. It is interesting to compare that to the first quarter of last year when a strong stock market boosted net income by $550 million in similar to last year's fourth quarter with a positive effect of $428 million. Volatility like this in revenues and net income does not seem to give a clear picture to investors trying to understand the business of operations of insurance. Changes in fair value of equity security still held are better reported and other comprehensive income consistent with fixed maturity securities, where it still affects book value and investors can see it more clearly. Hopefully FASB will revisit this in the near future. Turning to more customary topics. Investment income continue to grow a 5% for the first quarter of 2020, including 15% growth for dividend income. Net purchases of stocks during the quarter, totaled a $125 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio rose 1% compared with the same quarter a year-ago. The pre-tax average yield was 4.04% down 11 basis points from the first quarter of last year. While we continue to invest in bonds, we reported first quarter net sales of $6 million, as many bonds we purchased near the end of the quarter had not settled as of March 31st. As we reported in our 10-Q, the average pre-tax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds was roughly 74 basis points lower than the same period in 2019, further pressuring interest income. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the first quarter of 2020 were unfavorable for both our bond and stock portfolios. The overall net decrease was just over $2 billion before tax effects, including $324 million for our bond portfolio. Yes. This is Mike. So, and we will likely not and we will not be buying for the rest of the year. We have always said, or I have always said, Steve has always said that we have a maintenance, buyback philosophy. And so, we have done that again so far this year. So, even though, it is a little higher that we bought back here in the first quarter, two and a half million shares. When you look at it overtime, we have been running out a million shares that is kind of really required and I was looking back. The maintenance that we did this year, actually got us back to the same level of shares that we were about 10-years ago. So we have achieved what we have done and I probably do not see any other buybacks through the remainder of the year as part of our maintenance program. Yes. This is Mike Sewell. It will be in the expense line as of right now. We understand, there might be a group, NAIC and others that might be looking at that issue, but as of right now, it will be an expense."

            "name": "Stephen Spray",
            "content": "Mike, this is Steve Spray and Steve is right. It is about half of our policies where the policy holder increases their limit. Our standard property form like many others, includes a sub-limit automatically for business income of 25,000. Sure. Mark. This is Steve Sprite. Our commercial standard property policies automatically include a sub-limit of $25,000 of business income. And then obviously like many other coverages, policy holders can elect to increase that limit based on their exposure. So it is not uncommon for property policies to include automatically a sub-limit for business income across the industry, and ours just happens to be 25,000. But again, even for that 25,000, you still need to have the direct physical damage or loss in the insuring agreement to trigger coverage. That is correct. Yes. Sure. It is all over the board there Mark. And we are being extremely flexible as you would expect with our policy holders in that. So, many of our liability policies are based on payroll and sales. We are working with our customers to reduce those exposures here, midterms, so that it will reduce their premium. They are contacting us with some concerns on being able to pay. We have instituted, we are putting a moratorium on cancellations for nonpayment of premium up until May 31st or later, if a state mandates it. The key here is, we want to help our policy holders and our agents through this and anything we can do to help that we will. I would say it is probably still a little too early to understand or have a full picture on premium collections over the long pole. So far, things have been good. You mean, as far as the collections? Yes, I think this is a pretty broad based. We are not as far in the commercialized side which would be most impacted here. We newer to the northeast, which would certainly be more impacted by COVID. But I would say as far as the collections and individuals wanting to put layup credits on their fleet or reduce their exposures on their liability for payroll and sales. I would say that is pretty much across the board. Sure. Thank you. Yes, this is Steve Spray. I would say we are seeing a little reduced frequency in commercial auto but it is still too early to tell on that. That is something that we will probably have to report back to you at a later date. Something we are watching closely. I do think that commercial auto and personal auto are an apples and oranges here, because so many businesses are still up in running. I think everyone knows that almost 40% of our GL premium is in contractor classes. Construction, a knock on wood so far has been able to continue for the most part across the country. So those vehicles are still out operating. One of the other areas that we are helping our policyholders on is many restaurants or other retail businesses have moved to a delivery to help their communities. And we are extending the average. It is adding exposure to us but it is something that we feel is the right thing to do. And so our exposures are going up on the higher non-owned commercial auto from delivery standpoint that we didn't anticipate at the beginning of the policy period. I think that is perfect. I spent 10-years in the field, Phil and I do say that, if any company is built for this, it is Cincinnati Insurance Company. Having as few agencies as we do, having that limited franchise, I think helps us. We have fewer relationships to manage. We have deep relationships with each of them.

            "name": "Steven Johnston",
            "content": "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. As I reflect on the past quarter, I find myself feeling thankful. I applaud the efforts of our healthcare industry to stand on the frontlines of the pandemic, working tirelessly to protect us all. I thank our associates for their dedication and creativity to keep our business moving forward, and I appreciate working with the best independent agents in the business. This pandemic has illuminated the leadership and professionalism they deliver to their clients, guiding them through much uncertainty. I'm thankful to be a part of this noble industry. Spring storms didn't relent in the face of the pandemic and we stood ready to respond helping policy holders rebuild what was lost. I'm undeterred by the recent volatility we have experienced in the stock market, even though that volatility led to negative total revenues and a net loss for us in the first quarter. Thanks Mike. There is another point about future loss experience uncertainty that I want to emphasize. And we have heard investors ask related questions on other calls. Virtually all of our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property, because the virus does not produce direct physical damage or loss to property no coverage exists for this peril, rendering and exclusion unnecessary. For this reason most of our standard market, commercial property policies in states where we actively write business do not contain a specific exclusion for COVID-19, while we will evaluate each claim based on the specific facts and circumstances involved, our commercial property policies do not provide coverage for business interruption claims unless there is direct physical damage or loss to property. Throughout our Company's  (Ph) history, we have weathered many storms and we have the technology, the risk management expertise and the financial strength to weather this one. We have the best people in the industry. Together, we will take care of our Cincinnati family, protecting the health of our associates, serving agents and policy holders and emerging as an organization with new strengths to carry us forward. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marty Mullen, Marty Hollenbeck, Theresa Hopper, and Ken Stecher. Please open the call for questions. Good morning Mike. Mike, I think like every other insurance company, we expect that, we are going to receive our fair share of COVID-19 claims. I think, that is just natural. But, we feel strong in our position with our coverage language. I think we are still in the middle of this storm, and I think as more facts and circumstances come out here in the second quarter and third quarter, we will provide that information to the extended material. Yes. It is about half, Mike. Well, I would say that there is not a virus exclusion in there. It is generally a property, it is a property catastrophe risk policy. And they follow our fortunes and we would have a virus exclusion in there. Yes, that would be determined. If we ever got to that point, the hours clause for us as 120 hours, but our expectation is that we wouldn't be in that position. I don't think so at this point, but that is something again is second quarter, third quarter here evolves. We will keep an eye on things and we feel strong in our wording. We feel that an exclusion to those policies would just be belts and suspenders. And we feel that the policies do require physical damage or loss to the property. Okay. Thank you. Yes. We obviously feel good in our reserve position overall. We have developed favorably for 30-years now and we look at each line as it stands on its own. We do our best to make our best estimate. We think with the commercial auto, given the way it is been over the past several years, given what we saw with some of the paid trends that it was appropriate to do what we did with the commercial auto. In terms of the ENS, again, we feel strong in terms of our best estimate there. We did take a look at what was going on with defense and in cost containment, and we looked at that just across the casually lines for the standard and the ENS. For the standard we have asked some favorable movements and paid losses for the excess and surplus lines. We saw that go up by about a half a percent. And so, we just felt it appropriate to take the prudent action there, but we do feel good with the best estimate we have got in place. Yes. For the commercial auto, we have been getting in the mid single-digits this past quarter. I think with the ENS, the way I would describe that, it is been more that the lower single-digits overtime, but we have increased that quarter-after-quarter, month-after-month for years now. It is just a nice steady, keeping up if not exceeding inflationary trends and producing excellent combined ratios over long periods of time. It is just been a very steady approach there. Thank you. Yes, there is a couple of ways to look at that Meyer. Especially coming out of the financial crisis, there could be the thought before somebody gets laid off, they get injured. And there could be an increase in frequency. Offsetting that there could be with employers as they determine which employees they keep, they tend to keep the more experienced ones that would be safer. I think also with the another consideration would be what we are seeing with unemployment insurance and some of the increases in the payments for unemployment insurance, I think would have a mitigating effect there too. So, I think it is too early to really tell, but in terms of as you ask the long-term perspective, those would be some of the considerations that we would be looking at. Thank you. Yes.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  0:30 I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, you may proceed.\nDennis McDaniel:\n y: 1:11 On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. 1:45 First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. 2:14 And now, I will turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: 2:17 Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. It's satisfying to see excellent operating results and overall financial performance in 2021 and for both the fourth quarter and full year. As usual, we face challenges, but our strategy continues to work well. Thanks to outstanding efforts by our associates and the independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance. 2:45 Net income for the fourth quarter rose $421 million compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $346 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter 2021 was up $58 million or 22% versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 96% higher than 2020. 3:18 Our 84.2% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 3.1 percentage points better than last year with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 11 points of the improvement. An outstanding full year 2021 combined ratio of 88.3% was nearly 10 points better than last year with lower catastrophe losses representing 4.1 points of the improvement. 3:49 The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 1.5 percentage points better than accident year 2020 measured at 12 months. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain a 2022 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. 4:15 We also believe our 2022 property casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. Premium growth continued at a strong pace during the quarter, reflecting a strengthening economy generally steady pricing and the benefit of great relationships with our agents. 4:48 Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Pricing segmentation continues to be an emphasis with our underwriting working to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing. Renewal pricing during the fourth quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. 5:22 Our commercial lines Insurance segment again, experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases up a little for the third quarter. Our fourth quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the third quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment was near the low end of the high single-digit range. Our commercial lines segment had a superb year with its 83.8% combined ratio improving by 14.5 percentage points compared with 2020. and growing net written premiums by 8%. 6:06 For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year, driven by planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full year 2021 combined ratio of 94.0% and improved 3.1 percentage points from a year ago, including an excellent 80.0% for the fourth quarter. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-90% combined ratio for the fourth quarter and the year and grew full year net written premiums by 22%, another terrific year. 6:49 Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had another year of healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 53% for the full year 2021 as reinsurance market conditions improved. It experienced a modest underwriting loss that included significant losses from Hurricane Ida. Those losses remain within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ida's magnitude based on our models. 7:19 Cincinnati Global, its 2021 premiums by 6%, with a combined ratio below 90%. Our life insurance subsidiary generated full year 2021 net income of $44 million, up 38% from a year ago and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 7%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2022 are fairly similar to 2021. The main change for our property casualty treaty is retaining an additional $43 million of losses for the layers between $100 million and $600 million, while adding $47 million of coverage in a new layer between $800 million and $900 million. Rates for our property casualty treaties generally rose in the high single-digit range. We expect 2022 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $110 million, about 3% higher than last year. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. 8:45 Strong operating results measured as net income before investment gains and improved valuation of our investment portfolio, each made large contributions to VCR for both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. With VCR of 12.1% for the quarter, VCR for the full year was 25.7%, far exceeding our average annual target range of 10% to 13%. 9:14 Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on some other important aspects of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: 9:21 Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow at a strong pace, up 8% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year 2021 compared with the same periods a year ago. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%, and net equity security purchases totaled $177 million for the year. Bond interest income grew 4% in the fourth quarter, while the pretax average yield of 4.05% for the year was down 1 basis point from a year ago. 10:02 The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the full year 2021 was 3.47%. Investing in fixed maturity securities continues to be a priority with net purchases during the year totaling $927 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock holdings in aggregate, but unfavorable for our bond holdings. The overall fourth quarter net gain was nearly $1.4 billion before tax effects despite a decrease of $82 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the fourth quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $8 billion, including $7.2 billion for our equity securities. 11:07 Cash flow was very strong in the fourth quarter as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 5% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2021 generated just shy of $2 billion, a 33% increase compared with a year ago. Expense management efforts in 2021 were very good, and we continue to carefully balance strategic business investments and expense controls. 11:46 The full year 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.5 percentage points lower than last year even with an increase of 0.7 points from higher accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. 12:35 During full year 2021, we experienced $428 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 7.0%. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserves developed for the year was favorable by $283 million for 2020, $56 million for 2019, $44 million for 2018 and $45 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. 13:16 We believe overall reserves remain adequate. During 2021, net loss and loss expense reserves in total increased by 8%. The IBNR portion increased by 6% in 2021 and which followed an increase of 18% in 2020 for IBNR. 13:38 Turning to capital management. We also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our year-end financial strength remained in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. 14:00 During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 866,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.56. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I typically do, with a summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.26. Life insurance operations increased book value of $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items included $0.98. 14:48 Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.35. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $6.93, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $8.23 per share during the fourth quarter to a record $81.72 per share. 15:25 And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: 15:29 Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, 2021 ended with many positives. We again achieved excellent premium growth and completed a tenth straight year of underwriting profit. We extended our record of annual dividend increases to 61 years and have already set the stage for a second -- 62nd year. Earlier this month, AM Best recognized our capital strength and strong operating trends by affirming our A+ financial strength rating with a stable outlook. The key to our consistent results lies with our associates, who deliver who continue to deliver outstanding service to our agents and their clients, deepening our relationships with our agents and executing on our strategies for long-term success. 16:21 Before we open the call for questions, I want to take a minute to recognize Steve Spray's recent promotion to President of the Cincinnati Insurance Company and all of our U.S. subsidiary companies. This promotion is a natural next step in the evolution of our executive leadership team that began several years ago. 16:41 Because he's been in leadership roles across our organization, Steve has a deep understanding of what it will take to succeed far into the future. I'm confident that under his direction, our insurance subsidiaries will continue to grow deepening the products, services and capabilities we have to support our agents and create shareholder value. 17:05 As a reminder, with Mike, Steve and me today are Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Joanna (ph), please open the call for questions.\nOperator: 17:14  Your first question is from Mike Zaremski of Wolfe Research.\nMike Zaremski: 17:33 Hey, thanks and good morning. My first question is probably for Mike Sewell on reserves. And I believe I heard some of your prepared remarks. But I guess just, we're getting -- we've been getting a lot of questions. So if \u2013 and you have has best-in-class disclosure. So this is going to be specific. But if we look at Page 8 of the supplement, maybe you don't have it open, but I'll try to ask the question clearly. You show, if we focus on commercial lines, for example, since discloses losses incurred but not reported. And those numbers \u2013 those ratios have increased materially versus their historical averages in terms of the \u2013 in 2020, and they've been negative in 2021. And just I wanted to confirm that are those accident years, so vintage, like for this year's increase in commercial lines losses incurred but not reported of 6.9 points for the or sorry, negative 2.3 points for year -- the year 2021. Is that for the accident year '21 vintage only? Or is that for all vintages?\nSteve Johnston: 18:57 Let's make sure we're clear about what you're asking here, Mike. And just if we look at the favorable development that we show in the press release and so forth that we have shown here for the quarter and the year. Are you now trying to break it down by the quarter shown as...\nMike Zaremski: 19:19 Yes. I'm trying to just look at the losses incurred, but not reported line item, which is in the loss ratio detail page, page 8 of the supplement which for the -- yes.\nMike Sewell: 19:34 Yes.\nSteve Johnston: 19:36 We've got it.\nMike Sewell: 19:37 Yes, that's a great question. Yes, that's going to be really calendar year numbers and seeing that negative, you're right. That's -- I'm going to say you typically don't see that. But if I were to think about the reserves, the reserve development and what we've added in IBNR last year compared to this year, there was a bit of a difference. Last year, we was early on with COVID. There was a lot of uncertainty that was going on last year. And so with that, we had added about $456 million in IBNR in 2020 across many different lines. This year, we added about $135 million. And so you'll see that there is a decrease in that \u2013 you'll see that on Page 13 of the supplement. So as time passes, we obviously know a little bit more of what the experience is. We did see favorable development in the 2020 accident year. 20:49 And a lot of that was coming from the short-tail lines, as you might expect because we can see that a little quicker. For the long-tailed lines such as casualty, workers' comp, I think it's going to take a little bit longer to see development there. But as we've reported, and you'll see more of it coming out in our K, we did have development, a favorable development in the long-term lines. And similar to the past, it was over multiple years, so 2020, 2019, 2018 and before. And so you'll see some of our charts that we'll kind of lay that out. I always like to talk about the consistent approach we do to reserving, looking at 1 or 2 quarters does not set a trend. We've got very competent actuaries. And in fact is I don't think we've had any turnover with that group over the years. So it's a very consistent approach, looking at being in the upper half of the range. And so I'm just going to follow our actuaries lead and what they're seeing. That's a great question. Thank you for that.\nMike Zaremski: 22:08 Okay. No, that's \u2013 and sorry for not asking you probably clear enough. That's very helpful. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to personal lines. and maybe focusing on auto since it comes up a lot with investors too, given the loss inflation environment. Would you \u2013 results at least versus, I think, consensus expectations continue to be better than expected. Obviously, they've deteriorated year-over-year on an underlying basis. But just curious, I know you \u2013 since these has a more unique portfolio, regional-wise you're also moving into \u2013 increasingly into the high net worth space. Just curious, has anything surprised you maybe not just auto, too, it could be homeowners results as well. But anything that we should be thinking about as we think about how results have come in versus your expectations and I also -- I know a long-winded question, but you mentioned in the prepared remarks that pricing is ahead of prospective loss cost trends for each segment. And you also mentioned that personalized pricing is in the low-single digits, I believe. And so I'm just curious if your view is that personal lines loss cost trends are also in the low-single digits? Thanks.\nSteve Johnston: 23:37 Thanks, Mike. And yes, as we look at trends, we're very prospective with our loss cost trends. So what we're doing is looking at what we estimate to be the loss cost and the perspective rating period, the prospective policy period is kind of actuarial 101 to be prospective with our pricing. And so affecting the loss cost trend would be a lot of aspects of what we're doing. We would see the inflationary trends that we all know about and read about. And we would also see what we're doing on the underwriting side, what's happening, as you mentioned, with change in mix, going to more high net worth. We've introduced a new rating tier. And so there are a lot of things that on a prospective basis are impacting the loss cost trends. And we feel really good about the direction of personal lines. If you think about for the 11 years, this is a little bit of history, but it shows our long-term focus. If you look at the 11 years from 2008 through 2018, we only made an underwriting profit for personal lines in 2 of those years, and we had a total underwriting loss of roughly $500 million. We earned a we earned an underwriting profit in each of the last 3 years with a total underwriting gain of just under $140 million. And the calendar year GAAP combined ratio for each of these last 3 years has really trended positively from 99.8% to 97.1% to 94.0%. So we really feel that we're on the right track. We've got good momentum. And we feel really good about the future prospects of personal lines.\nMike Zaremski: 25:21 That's helpful. So I'm just curious, we know that you're willing to give an overall company combined ratio goal. Given the mix shift change in personal lines, can you remind us -- have you offered a combined ratio goal that you strive for in personal lines?\nSteveJohnston: 25:43 We haven't. That is not something that we have a disclosure on.\nMike Zaremski: 25:49 Okay. Thank you very much.\nSteveJohnston: 25:54 Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: 25:55 Your next question is from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: 26:00 Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter folks.\nSteveJohnston: 26:06 Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Newsome: 26:06 I was hoping you could just maybe bang a little bit more on the mid-90s combined ratio goal. I think that might be a deterioration over this year. And how does that reconcile with the idea that particularly in commercial insurance, you're getting pricing, hopefully better than underlying claims costs? Are there some pieces in there, reserve  whatever that we're -- we should be thinking about?\nSteveJohnston: 26:45 No, Paul, we don't feel that, that's a forecast for a deterioration. It's the all-in GAAP combined ratio that would be comparable to the 88.3% that we turned in this year. We had 7 points of favorable loss development this year. So even if it was \u2013 you make the pick, but I say it was 3.5%, that would take us to 91.8%. So we don't feel that's forecasting any kind of a deterioration. We just think that we're looking at long-term trends. And the way we are, we're fruiting around here, and we'd rather under communicate and overdeliver.\nPaul Newsome: 27:30 Understood. And then back to the personal lines. Your results really have been different from the industry from a -- it appears like a frequency severity perspective. Can you maybe talk to those levels in auto why perhaps you haven't seen the biggest -- the inflationary impact that others have seen on the severity side? And if frequency for you folks is stabilized back where it was pre-pandemic? Or just thinking if you could talk a little bit to the underlying components and how they may differ from what we're seeing with the rest of the industry.\nSteve Johnston: 28:17 Yes. And there's just been a lot of hard work, Paul, over -- these things don't happen overnight. It's over a period of years. And just kind of as I described that improvement in the personal lines combined ratio over the last 3 years. It started some time before that. It's -- you don't turn a battleship on a dime, and the personal lines leadership has just done a great job of addressing issues, whether it be on the state level, change in mix, change in underwriting, introducing new models, new pricing tiers. And again, the shift towards more high net worth. And that's where we're getting a lot of the new business. And when you look at what we disclosed in terms of rate changes, that's going to be more on the renewal book. So to the extent we're having great new business growth and what we feel to be a profitable segment, that affects things. So it's really the accumulation of just a lot of hard, detailed work over a number of years by the personalized leadership.\nPaul Newsome: 29:29 No. Absolutely understood. I guess if you adjust for that, do you think you're seeing the same sort of series and frequency and severity that others are seeing and it's all about the reentering mix shift? Or is there something unique about your book that might make it just different from others seeing these broader trends?\nSteve Johnston: 29:51 Paul, I hate to say it, but I don't pay that much of attention to others. They, other companies have different strategies, different \u2013 a lot of different things. So we give you what we're seeing, what we're doing. I think we're pretty open in our disclosure and again, feel very confident with our personal lines with the improvement we've seen now over 3 years steadily and just recognize all the hard work that's going on within our company.\nPaul Newsome: 30:25 Absolutely. Congratulations on the quarter, guys. It's great. Appreciate.\nSteve Johnston: 30:30 Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: 30:33 Your next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: 30:39 Thanks. I want to start, if I can on commercial lines. Steve, hopefully, you can explain what is it that drove the acceleration in pricing from the third quarter to the fourth quarter? The general sense we have is that outside of cyber, rate increases are slowing down a little bit and your experience is moving in the other direction.\nSteve Spray: 30:58 Meyer, this is Steve Spray. Good question. I think for us, it's risk-by-risk. It's agency-by-agency, location-by-location. We just -- you really can't look at the average with us. There's so much more in the full distribution of our rate. And I think that over time, the pricing sophistication, the segmentation, our execution of that, working with agents has just allowed us to execute on that.\nMeyer Shields: 31:35 Okay. No, that's helpful. If I go back to personal lines. Obviously, the results in the fourth quarter were fantastic. But when we look broadly at the combination of the targeted customer groups and your geographic footprint, what sort of seasonality should we expect in the accident year ex-cat loss ratio for auto and home?\nSteve Johnston: 32:00 I think it's best to focus on the full year. And I think generally, the way that we promulgate our loss ratio picks, we're looking at a full year as we go through time. There will be some seasonality, certainly, with catastrophe losses and so forth. But I think we've shown pretty stable results throughout the year. I think it's come from efforts of geographic diversification. An example would be what happened here in the fourth quarter with losses that -- and really bad damage that came to Kentucky. Our claims representatives just did a fantastic job of taking care of people down there. Kentucky's smaller percentage of what used to be to us as we've grown geographically and by product line, diversifying the company, and we're in a position where we think that any given catastrophe loss now has less of an impact on us than it did before. So I would focus on the annual picks. We're long term. We don't go quarter-by-quarter. We do our best to make our best estimates for reserves at every quarter and keep a longer-term view of the business.\nMeyer Shields: 33:27 Okay. Perfect. And if I can throw one more in. The reserving history in Cincinnati is sort of unquestionable. Have you adjusted the inputs in terms of loss trend for -- in the guidance for 2022?\nSteve Johnston: 33:41 I think our actuaries do a really good job. And you and I have talked about this before on the calls of really balancing the stability and the responsiveness of the picks. And so as we look at trends, I think we've been stable over time, not overdoing it in terms of being overly optimistic in the 2020 year when there was so much uncertainty. And you really didn't know what you were seeing in terms of the reporting patterns when you had everything to consider in terms of the economy, potential slowdown in court cases. And so I think we've been quite stable through the period of time in making our picks and they're doing the same thing as we think about 2022.\nMeyer Shields: 34:37 Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much.\nOperator: 34:43  Your next question is from Scott Heleniak of RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Heleniak: 35:00 Yes. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the -- you had given the guidance about the premium growth rate of 8% or more for 2022. And I'm just wondering if that assumes a similar amount of agency appointments that you had, you had around 200 or so? And does it also contemplate similar growth rates by unit that you saw in 2021? I'm just wondering if you can give more detail on that 8% or better number.\nSteve Spray: 35:30 Yes, Scott, Steve Spray. Yes, you can consider -- or you can expect us to continue add agencies across the country. We do it whether -- where maybe the population would dictate it or for whatever reason, an area, our growth would slow, that's when we would make agency appointment. So you can expect us to continue to add high-quality agencies to the overall percentage. As far as the -- by segment, just feel really good about the runway ahead of us in all those areas. The way we do business locally face-to-face, take the company out into the community where our agents are, make decisions locally, have our field reps to drive everything for us. And their primary function is to underwrite and price all new commercial lines business that can meet with policyholders. We just think our model and continuing to add product services for our agents. We think across all lines of business that we can continue to contribute to that growth.\nScott Heleniak: 36:43 All right. I appreciate that. I wanted to ask too about this is switching gears a little bit, but just the -- I wanted to talk about where you're deploying the proceeds you had $1.4 billion in net realized gains. You obviously had some sales in the quarter. And wonder if you can touch a little more on that where you're deploying capital. I think you had mentioned in the prepared remarks about fixed income is a priority, but just any more detail on that just because it was a larger number than normal?\nMike Sewell: 37:16 No, that's a great question. And with the operating cash flow that we did have this year. Obviously, there's different ways to deploy the capital. Steve mentioned about increasing the dividends, and we're doing that again here in 2022 with the Boards, it was about 9.5% increase. But keeping some of the funds capital within the company for future growth that Steve Spray just talked about, but then really turning it over to Marty Hollenbeck, and maybe he'll make a comment here. But adding to our investment portfolio that's growing investment overall income and having the financial strength to pay claims when they come up and are needed is very critical for us. But we turned a lot over to Marty, and I'm not sure if Marty, you might want to make a few comments?\nMartin Hollenbeck: 38:12 Mike, you nailed it. Yes, we were heavy investors in the bond market, the most we have, I believe, in history. Cash is not really going to put an alternative right now. So we were consistently in the bond market. We did add to our equity positions to some degree. We do have internal monitoring controls there as to how high we would let that get. So it was a very active year for the fixed income market, particularly the taxable side of the bond portfolio.\nScott Heleniak: 38:44 Okay. Great. That's helpful. Just one last one, too, on the expense ratio. I don't know if there's any commentary or thoughts you can give on 2022. You had some improvement. It was up for Q4, but it would improve for the year. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that for 2022 versus 2021.\nMike Sewell: 39:06 Yeah. That's great. And sometimes it really is hard to kind of give a projection because as we just saw here in the fourth quarter and on a year-to-date basis, what's the profitability going to be for the underwriting, which is a big driver is the profit sharing and commissions for the agency. So that was a big driver this year. If you were to normalize that, I might go back to -- our goal is to have a 30% expense ratio and moving towards that. The way we do that is by watching every dollar that we spend. Of course, we're going to increase spending, everything cost more. But if we can keep that increased spending to a level that is lower than the growth of the premiums, we should be making headwinds on that or making progress towards a 30% expense ratio. So it's really hard to give guidance on that. Unless I already really know what underwriting performance is going to be. But I think I'm really excited for 2022 here.\nScott Heleniak: 40:24 Yes. Understood. Thanks a lot for your answers.\nOperator: 40:32 Thank you. Presenters, I am no longer seeing any other \u2013 I think we do have a follow-up question from Mike Zaremski.\nMike Zaremski: 40:51 Great. Quick question on personal lines. Can you update us on just approximately what percentage of the portfolio is considered high net worth? Now I think the last math we did was it was approaching 50% of the book. And maybe the answer is just a simple yes. But do you expect the high net worth profitability level to be materially different than the non-high net worth portfolio. Thanks.\nSteve Spray: 41:29 Yes, Mike, Steve Spray, again. Yes, our high net worth book all in is about 42% now. on a net written premium basis of all personal lines. We could not be happier with the way our high net worth initiative over time has produced and progressed. We've added a lot of expertise. We've continued to grow it. We think we're in a unique position as well because we've got -- we're -- I think we're one of the only markets out there that has both a very sizable middle-market personal lines book and a high net worth, and we have expertise in both, and it's important to our agents. It fits into our agency strategy, we can attract that much more business for our agents. And I would say, over time, if you look at just the industry over time, high net worth personal lines has outperformed middle market. Cat losses in the last few years have certainly impacted the industry, but we believe, again, over time that, that high net worth segment will potentially outperform the middle market. But we do \u2013 I will say this, we do expect both segments to make a profit. And with what we've done with pricing sophistication, segmentation, as Steve mentioned earlier, additional tiers, we're very confident in what we can do in the middle market space, too.\nMike Zaremski: 43:06 So earlier, when you kind of talked about the 10-plus year history of personal lines and how it's doing a lot better, it sounds like it's not just due to potentially the high net worth portfolio. And you're basically not fighting and telling me that the high net worth portfolio is a lot more profitable yet. Maybe there's a new business penalty even in the -- as you grow the high net worth portion of the book?\nSteve Spray: 43:32 Well, yes, the answer to that -- the first part of that. Yes, middle market has continued to perform well. And that's driven -- it's fair share of that profitability overall. We expect both segments to be profitable. We're not going to \u2013 we don't want to have one segment subsidized in the other. They both do behave differently. But I think, again, we've got the expertise on both fronts to make them both grow and grow profitably and feel very good, like Steve said, about our prospects for the future for personal lines and what we're bringing to our agencies.\nMike Zaremski: 44:11 Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: 44:15 Presenters, I am no longer seeing any questions on the queue. I'd like to turn the call over back to Mr. Steve Johnston, CEO.\nSteve Johnston: 44:24 Thank you, Joanna. And thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2022 call. Have a great day.\nOperator: 44:33 Thank you, presenters. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

            "content": "2:17 Thank you, Dennis, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. It's satisfying to see excellent operating results and overall financial performance in 2021 and for both the fourth quarter and full year. As usual, we face challenges, but our strategy continues to work well. Thanks to outstanding efforts by our associates and the independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance. 2:45 Net income for the fourth quarter rose $421 million compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $346 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter 2021 was up $58 million or 22% versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 96% higher than 2020. 3:18 Our 84.2% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 3.1 percentage points better than last year with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 11 points of the improvement. An outstanding full year 2021 combined ratio of 88.3% was nearly 10 points better than last year with lower catastrophe losses representing 4.1 points of the improvement. 3:49 The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 1.5 percentage points better than accident year 2020 measured at 12 months. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to maintain a 2022 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. 4:15 We also believe our 2022 property casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends are some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. Premium growth continued at a strong pace during the quarter, reflecting a strengthening economy generally steady pricing and the benefit of great relationships with our agents. 4:48 Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% for both the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Pricing segmentation continues to be an emphasis with our underwriting working to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing. Renewal pricing during the fourth quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. 5:22 Our commercial lines Insurance segment again, experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases up a little for the third quarter. Our fourth quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the third quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment was near the low end of the high single-digit range. Our commercial lines segment had a superb year with its 83.8% combined ratio improving by 14.5 percentage points compared with 2020. and growing net written premiums by 8%. 6:06 For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year, driven by planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full year 2021 combined ratio of 94.0% and improved 3.1 percentage points from a year ago, including an excellent 80.0% for the fourth quarter. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-90% combined ratio for the fourth quarter and the year and grew full year net written premiums by 22%, another terrific year. 6:49 Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had another year of healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 53% for the full year 2021 as reinsurance market conditions improved. It experienced a modest underwriting loss that included significant losses from Hurricane Ida. Those losses remain within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ida's magnitude based on our models. 7:19 Cincinnati Global, its 2021 premiums by 6%, with a combined ratio below 90%. Our life insurance subsidiary generated full year 2021 net income of $44 million, up 38% from a year ago and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 7%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2022 are fairly similar to 2021. The main change for our property casualty treaty is retaining an additional $43 million of losses for the layers between $100 million and $600 million, while adding $47 million of coverage in a new layer between $800 million and $900 million. Rates for our property casualty treaties generally rose in the high single-digit range. We expect 2022 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $110 million, about 3% higher than last year. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. 8:45 Strong operating results measured as net income before investment gains and improved valuation of our investment portfolio, each made large contributions to VCR for both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis. With VCR of 12.1% for the quarter, VCR for the full year was 25.7%, far exceeding our average annual target range of 10% to 13%. 9:14 Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on some other important aspects of our financial performance. 15:29 Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, 2021 ended with many positives. We again achieved excellent premium growth and completed a tenth straight year of underwriting profit. We extended our record of annual dividend increases to 61 years and have already set the stage for a second -- 62nd year. Earlier this month, AM Best recognized our capital strength and strong operating trends by affirming our A+ financial strength rating with a stable outlook. The key to our consistent results lies with our associates, who deliver who continue to deliver outstanding service to our agents and their clients, deepening our relationships with our agents and executing on our strategies for long-term success. 16:21 Before we open the call for questions, I want to take a minute to recognize Steve Spray's recent promotion to President of the Cincinnati Insurance Company and all of our U.S. subsidiary companies. This promotion is a natural next step in the evolution of our executive leadership team that began several years ago. 16:41 Because he's been in leadership roles across our organization, Steve has a deep understanding of what it will take to succeed far into the future. I'm confident that under his direction, our insurance subsidiaries will continue to grow deepening the products, services and capabilities we have to support our agents and create shareholder value. 17:05 As a reminder, with Mike, Steve and me today are Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Joanna (ph), please open the call for questions. 18:57 Let's make sure we're clear about what you're asking here, Mike. And just if we look at the favorable development that we show in the press release and so forth that we have shown here for the quarter and the year. Are you now trying to break it down by the quarter shown as... 19:36 We've got it. 23:37 Thanks, Mike. And yes, as we look at trends, we're very prospective with our loss cost trends. So what we're doing is looking at what we estimate to be the loss cost and the perspective rating period, the prospective policy period is kind of actuarial 101 to be prospective with our pricing. And so affecting the loss cost trend would be a lot of aspects of what we're doing. We would see the inflationary trends that we all know about and read about. And we would also see what we're doing on the underwriting side, what's happening, as you mentioned, with change in mix, going to more high net worth. We've introduced a new rating tier. And so there are a lot of things that on a prospective basis are impacting the loss cost trends. And we feel really good about the direction of personal lines. If you think about for the 11 years, this is a little bit of history, but it shows our long-term focus. If you look at the 11 years from 2008 through 2018, we only made an underwriting profit for personal lines in 2 of those years, and we had a total underwriting loss of roughly $500 million. We earned a we earned an underwriting profit in each of the last 3 years with a total underwriting gain of just under $140 million. And the calendar year GAAP combined ratio for each of these last 3 years has really trended positively from 99.8% to 97.1% to 94.0%. So we really feel that we're on the right track. We've got good momentum. And we feel really good about the future prospects of personal lines. 25:43 We haven't. That is not something that we have a disclosure on. 25:54 Thank you, Mike. 26:06 Thanks, Paul. 26:45 No, Paul, we don't feel that, that's a forecast for a deterioration. It's the all-in GAAP combined ratio that would be comparable to the 88.3% that we turned in this year. We had 7 points of favorable loss development this year. So even if it was \u2013 you make the pick, but I say it was 3.5%, that would take us to 91.8%. So we don't feel that's forecasting any kind of a deterioration. We just think that we're looking at long-term trends. And the way we are, we're fruiting around here, and we'd rather under communicate and overdeliver. 28:17 Yes. And there's just been a lot of hard work, Paul, over -- these things don't happen overnight. It's over a period of years. And just kind of as I described that improvement in the personal lines combined ratio over the last 3 years. It started some time before that. It's -- you don't turn a battleship on a dime, and the personal lines leadership has just done a great job of addressing issues, whether it be on the state level, change in mix, change in underwriting, introducing new models, new pricing tiers. And again, the shift towards more high net worth. And that's where we're getting a lot of the new business. And when you look at what we disclosed in terms of rate changes, that's going to be more on the renewal book. So to the extent we're having great new business growth and what we feel to be a profitable segment, that affects things. So it's really the accumulation of just a lot of hard, detailed work over a number of years by the personalized leadership. 29:51 Paul, I hate to say it, but I don't pay that much of attention to others. They, other companies have different strategies, different \u2013 a lot of different things. So we give you what we're seeing, what we're doing. I think we're pretty open in our disclosure and again, feel very confident with our personal lines with the improvement we've seen now over 3 years steadily and just recognize all the hard work that's going on within our company. 30:30 Thanks, Paul. 32:00 I think it's best to focus on the full year. And I think generally, the way that we promulgate our loss ratio picks, we're looking at a full year as we go through time. There will be some seasonality, certainly, with catastrophe losses and so forth. But I think we've shown pretty stable results throughout the year. I think it's come from efforts of geographic diversification. An example would be what happened here in the fourth quarter with losses that -- and really bad damage that came to Kentucky. Our claims representatives just did a fantastic job of taking care of people down there. Kentucky's smaller percentage of what used to be to us as we've grown geographically and by product line, diversifying the company, and we're in a position where we think that any given catastrophe loss now has less of an impact on us than it did before. So I would focus on the annual picks. We're long term. We don't go quarter-by-quarter. We do our best to make our best estimates for reserves at every quarter and keep a longer-term view of the business. 33:41 I think our actuaries do a really good job. And you and I have talked about this before on the calls of really balancing the stability and the responsiveness of the picks. And so as we look at trends, I think we've been stable over time, not overdoing it in terms of being overly optimistic in the 2020 year when there was so much uncertainty. And you really didn't know what you were seeing in terms of the reporting patterns when you had everything to consider in terms of the economy, potential slowdown in court cases. And so I think we've been quite stable through the period of time in making our picks and they're doing the same thing as we think about 2022. 44:24 Thank you, Joanna. And thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2022 call. Have a great day."

            "content": "30:58 Meyer, this is Steve Spray. Good question. I think for us, it's risk-by-risk. It's agency-by-agency, location-by-location. We just -- you really can't look at the average with us. There's so much more in the full distribution of our rate. And I think that over time, the pricing sophistication, the segmentation, our execution of that, working with agents has just allowed us to execute on that. 35:30 Yes, Scott, Steve Spray. Yes, you can consider -- or you can expect us to continue add agencies across the country. We do it whether -- where maybe the population would dictate it or for whatever reason, an area, our growth would slow, that's when we would make agency appointment. So you can expect us to continue to add high-quality agencies to the overall percentage. As far as the -- by segment, just feel really good about the runway ahead of us in all those areas. The way we do business locally face-to-face, take the company out into the community where our agents are, make decisions locally, have our field reps to drive everything for us. And their primary function is to underwrite and price all new commercial lines business that can meet with policyholders. We just think our model and continuing to add product services for our agents. We think across all lines of business that we can continue to contribute to that growth. 41:29 Yes, Mike, Steve Spray, again. Yes, our high net worth book all in is about 42% now. on a net written premium basis of all personal lines. We could not be happier with the way our high net worth initiative over time has produced and progressed. We've added a lot of expertise. We've continued to grow it. We think we're in a unique position as well because we've got -- we're -- I think we're one of the only markets out there that has both a very sizable middle-market personal lines book and a high net worth, and we have expertise in both, and it's important to our agents. It fits into our agency strategy, we can attract that much more business for our agents. And I would say, over time, if you look at just the industry over time, high net worth personal lines has outperformed middle market. Cat losses in the last few years have certainly impacted the industry, but we believe, again, over time that, that high net worth segment will potentially outperform the middle market. But we do \u2013 I will say this, we do expect both segments to make a profit. And with what we've done with pricing sophistication, segmentation, as Steve mentioned earlier, additional tiers, we're very confident in what we can do in the middle market space, too. 43:32 Well, yes, the answer to that -- the first part of that. Yes, middle market has continued to perform well. And that's driven -- it's fair share of that profitability overall. We expect both segments to be profitable. We're not going to \u2013 we don't want to have one segment subsidized in the other. They both do behave differently. But I think, again, we've got the expertise on both fronts to make them both grow and grow profitably and feel very good, like Steve said, about our prospects for the future for personal lines and what we're bringing to our agencies."

So we were consistently in the bond market. We did add to our equity positions to some degree. We do have internal monitoring controls there as to how high we would let that get. So it was a very active year for the fixed income market, particularly the taxable side of the bond portfolio."

            "content": "9:21 Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow at a strong pace, up 8% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year 2021 compared with the same periods a year ago. Fourth quarter dividend income was up 14%, and net equity security purchases totaled $177 million for the year. Bond interest income grew 4% in the fourth quarter, while the pretax average yield of 4.05% for the year was down 1 basis point from a year ago. 10:02 The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the full year 2021 was 3.47%. Investing in fixed maturity securities continues to be a priority with net purchases during the year totaling $927 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock holdings in aggregate, but unfavorable for our bond holdings. The overall fourth quarter net gain was nearly $1.4 billion before tax effects despite a decrease of $82 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the fourth quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $8 billion, including $7.2 billion for our equity securities. 11:07 Cash flow was very strong in the fourth quarter as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 5% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2021 generated just shy of $2 billion, a 33% increase compared with a year ago. Expense management efforts in 2021 were very good, and we continue to carefully balance strategic business investments and expense controls. 11:46 The full year 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.5 percentage points lower than last year even with an increase of 0.7 points from higher accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. 12:35 During full year 2021, we experienced $428 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 7.0%. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserves developed for the year was favorable by $283 million for 2020, $56 million for 2019, $44 million for 2018 and $45 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. 13:16 We believe overall reserves remain adequate. During 2021, net loss and loss expense reserves in total increased by 8%. The IBNR portion increased by 6% in 2021 and which followed an increase of 18% in 2020 for IBNR. 13:38 Turning to capital management. We also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our year-end financial strength remained in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. 14:00 During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 866,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.56. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I typically do, with a summary of fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.26. Life insurance operations increased book value of $0.04. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items included $0.98. 14:48 Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.35. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $6.93, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $8.23 per share during the fourth quarter to a record $81.72 per share. 15:25 And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. 19:34 Yes. 19:37 Yes, that's a great question. Yes, that's going to be really calendar year numbers and seeing that negative, you're right. That's -- I'm going to say you typically don't see that. But if I were to think about the reserves, the reserve development and what we've added in IBNR last year compared to this year, there was a bit of a difference. Last year, we was early on with COVID. There was a lot of uncertainty that was going on last year. And so with that, we had added about $456 million in IBNR in 2020 across many different lines. This year, we added about $135 million. And so you'll see that there is a decrease in that \u2013 you'll see that on Page 13 of the supplement. So as time passes, we obviously know a little bit more of what the experience is. We did see favorable development in the 2020 accident year. 20:49 And a lot of that was coming from the short-tail lines, as you might expect because we can see that a little quicker. For the long-tailed lines such as casualty, workers' comp, I think it's going to take a little bit longer to see development there. But as we've reported, and you'll see more of it coming out in our K, we did have development, a favorable development in the long-term lines. And similar to the past, it was over multiple years, so 2020, 2019, 2018 and before. And so you'll see some of our charts that we'll kind of lay that out. I always like to talk about the consistent approach we do to reserving, looking at 1 or 2 quarters does not set a trend. We've got very competent actuaries. And in fact is I don't think we've had any turnover with that group over the years. So it's a very consistent approach, looking at being in the upper half of the range. And so I'm just going to follow our actuaries lead and what they're seeing. That's a great question. Thank you for that. 37:16 No, that's a great question. And with the operating cash flow that we did have this year. Obviously, there's different ways to deploy the capital. Steve mentioned about increasing the dividends, and we're doing that again here in 2022 with the Boards, it was about 9.5% increase. But keeping some of the funds capital within the company for future growth that Steve Spray just talked about, but then really turning it over to Marty Hollenbeck, and maybe he'll make a comment here. But adding to our investment portfolio that's growing investment overall income and having the financial strength to pay claims when they come up and are needed is very critical for us. But we turned a lot over to Marty, and I'm not sure if Marty, you might want to make a few comments? 39:06 Yeah. That's great. And sometimes it really is hard to kind of give a projection because as we just saw here in the fourth quarter and on a year-to-date basis, what's the profitability going to be for the underwriting, which is a big driver is the profit sharing and commissions for the agency. So that was a big driver this year. If you were to normalize that, I might go back to -- our goal is to have a 30% expense ratio and moving towards that. The way we do that is by watching every dollar that we spend. Of course, we're going to increase spending, everything cost more. But if we can keep that increased spending to a level that is lower than the growth of the premiums, we should be making headwinds on that or making progress towards a 30% expense ratio. So it's really hard to give guidance on that. Unless I already really know what underwriting performance is going to be. But I think I'm really excited for 2022 here."

I would now like to hand the call over to your speaker today, Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, you may proceed.\nDennis McDaniel : Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link and a navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.  At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another good quarter. While weather-related catastrophes were lower than a year ago, communities across our country were impacted by hail, wind, flooding and fire. As we send our field claims associates into these communities, they shine, providing excellent service in reassuring affected families and businesses. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 fell $331 million compared with the third quarter of last year due to $457 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.  Equity portfolio fair value changes have caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters recently, and net income increased $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared with a year ago, despite the third quarter decrease. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2021 more than tripled, up $146 million or 232% versus a year ago, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis contributing $31 million of the increase.  Our 92.6% third quarter 2021 property casualty combined ratio was 11 percentage points better than last year, with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 4.1 points of the improvement. Our current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.5 percentage points better than the first 9 months of 2020. Premium growth continued at a nice pace during the quarter as a strengthening economy and great relationships we enjoy with our agents helped us grow ahead of industry estimates.  Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the third quarter of 2021. We continue to focus on risk segmentation, giving our underwriters the tools they need to retain and write more profitable accounts while walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. Renewal pricing during the third quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial lines insurance segment again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases, down slightly from the second quarter.  Our third quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the second quarter, including personal auto in the low-single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high-single-digit range. Our commercial lines segment had an outstanding quarter with this 80.6% combined ratio improving by 21.8 percentage points compared with the third quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 10%.  For our personal lines segment, third quarter net written premiums grew 7% as it continued to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter 2021 combined ratio was higher than a year ago, largely due to driving patterns moving towards pre-pandemic levels, increasing our personal auto loss ratio.  Personal auto still produced a small underwriting profit for the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2021, our personal lines segment in total had an underwriting profit.  Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-95% combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year and grew third quarter net written premiums by 30%. The Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each grew net written premiums in the third quarter of 2021. While both experienced significant losses from Hurricane Ida leading to underwriting losses for the quarter, we weren't surprised by the level of loss we saw for an event of this magnitude based on our models. Our life insurance subsidiary produced third quarter 2021 net income of $11 million and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results measured as net income before investment gains were the largest component of our VCR for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. VCR through September 30, 2021, was 12.4%, already reaching our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add perspective on some other areas of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell : Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income grew nicely during the third quarter of 2021, up 7% compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter dividend income was up 11%, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $153 million for the first 9 months of the year. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 7%, and the pretax average yield was 4.06%, up 3 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of 2021 was 3.43%. Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority with net purchases during the first 9 months of the year totaling $694 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2021 were modestly unfavorable for both our stock and bond portfolios.  The overall third quarter net loss was $158 million before tax effects, including $105 million for our equity holdings and $80 million for our bond holdings. At the end of the third quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.8 billion for our equity securities. Cash flow was very strong in the third quarter, as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the third quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2021 generated $1.5 billion, a 36% increase compared with a year ago period. Expense management is another area we focus, always trying to optimize the balance of strategic business investments and expense controls. The third quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter, including 1.2 points due to higher accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. Moving on to loss reserves. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the third quarter of 2021, we experienced $102 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 6.4% for the quarter.  On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of the year was favorable by $225 million for 2020, $46 million for 2019, $39 million for 2018 and $21 million in aggregate for all accident years prior to 2018. Regarding capital management, we also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of a maintenance intended to offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our quarter end financial strength was in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.3. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I typically do, with a summary of third quarter contributions to the book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.  Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.59. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.39. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $0.51, and we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $0.08 per share during the third quarter to $73.49 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mike. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to demand flexibility in how we accomplish our day-to-day tasks. However, by staying focused on the steady execution of our long-term initiatives, we are able to keep producing these strong results. We have the people, the technology and the drive to continue delivering strong value for shareholders for years to come. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Grace, please open the call for questions.\nOperator:  The first question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome : I'm curious as to whether or not you are seeing any of the same issues that some others have reported in personal lines with trying to get rate and getting push back from the regulators. Because obviously, there was kind of effectively a windfall last year, but that's, I think, obviously temporary, but it doesn't really go into the math of how you file rates. Any thoughts on that? And if you -- are you seeing any some of the same issues that some others are seeing?\nSteve Johnston : Well, I would say our relationships with our regulators are good that -- as a general statement that we are doing fine and getting rate increases or just changes to our rate structure approved. There are obviously some states that are tougher than others. But I think overall, again, with good relationships with the regulators, we're in a good position vis-a-vis getting adjustments to our rating plans approved.\nPaul Newsome : Great. And a broad question, I think, on inflation trends. Some of your peers have talked about the potential for a little bit higher inflation, particularly in the commercial lines side as we see maybe a resumption of cases coming through the courts and maybe perhaps a lag effect with some of the inflation that we've seen early on in home and auto showing up in the commercial line side of the house. Any thoughts on that? Do you think that's a reasonable assumption? And does it show up in any way in your own numbers?\nSteve Johnston : We certainly see the prospects. There\u2019s social inflation. There\u2019s the inflation of the cost and goods that we use to settle claims for cars, for houses, the supply chain issues, there could be lags in the court system and so forth. We build this all into our models. And as we look at what we see to be loss cost trends, we try to be very prospective and look forward into what we think loss cost will be in the prospective policy period that we will be ensuring and feel comfortable that we\u2019re getting rate that is ahead of those loss cost trends in each of our segments.\nPaul Newsome : Great. Congrats on the quarter. Always appreciate your insights.\nSteve Johnston : Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Next up, we have Mike Zaremski from Wolfe Research.\nCharlie Lederer: This is actually Charlie Lederer on for Mike. So for my first question, can you talk about the sustainability of the strong underlying margins? Were there any like notable like current year reserve development that benefited it?\nSteve Johnston : We feel good, Charlie, about the sustainability of our results as we look forward with estimates of loss cost trends and pricing. And feel comfortable in making our best estimates of our reserves, and we're very optimistic for the future performance of the underwriting of the company.\nCharlie Lederer: Okay. And I know you mentioned the reserve releases by accident year. Could you give any color around the releases, particularly from the recent accident years?\nMike Sewell: Yes. Charlie, this is Mike Sewell. So related to, as I mentioned, for the quarterly, it was 6.4 points. There was certain areas that were more on the current more recent accident years, which is probably no surprise when you think about the short tail lines, which would be commercial property, commercial auto, all of the personal lines, so mainly those developments were favorable in accident year 2020. But even with that, I'd be cautious with -- there's a lot of uncertainty with the pandemic and other things going on around there. If I look at the workers' compensation, that's one of our longest tails that we have. That one has favorable development that I would say goes over several accident years back a few years. So you're seeing favorable development there. The claims frequency seems to have declined a little bit, but we put a lot of cost control measures in over the years that has really been benefiting the workers' comp line of business. And then lastly, commercial casualty, really there, looking at the paid loss, case reserve data over time are important factors for how that -- how those develop. Those have been favorable and some of the more recent accident years, the last couple, not just the last one. But as we look at in total for the property casualty business, you look at paid losses as a percent to incurred. It was up slightly for year-to-date 2021 versus last year, but it is below the 2017 through 2019 averages. So you'll see that in our supplement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle : Just a couple of questions. First, on the E&S unit, there was -- it wasn\u2019t very much in dollar terms, but there was a reserve addition there. I was wondering if you could talk about that in a little more detail as those are sort of rare.\nSteve Johnston : I just think as we look at the environment, Mark, we see a little bit maybe -- I don\u2019t know if you call it but a slowdown in the settlement rate there as we have claims that are taking a little bit longer to settle. And so in terms of coming up with our best estimate there, we want to recognize that, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing.\nMark Dwelle : Okay. The second question I wanted to ask, I mean, you had a pretty strong growth in new business, certainly over the last year, but it was a pretty good quarter for new business. Anything that you\u2019re seeing in terms of the type of customers that you\u2019re winning or geographic spread of where you\u2019re winning? Just a little bit of color on where the new stuff is coming from.\nSteve Spray: Yes, Mark, this is Steve Spray. We\u2019re seeing it across our entire footprint. And I think it -- as you mentioned, there\u2019s a little bit of an easier comp from the pandemic year last year. But I just think it -- again, it is execution of our agency-focused strategy, doing business locally, face-to-face with our agents, building deep relationships, underwriting and pricing, every single account policy by policy. We\u2019re out there. We\u2019re aggressively trying to help our agents write business solve problems. Our field reps, our field underwriters. We use that interchangeably, have the same pricing tools that our renewal underwriters have here. So we feel good about the pricing of the new business that we\u2019re writing. It\u2019s just -- I think it\u2019s just continued solid execution, quite frankly, across all of our segments on the new business front, and it goes those deep relationships we have with our agents.\nMark Dwelle : And then one other question also kind of relating mainly to renewals and the extent that you\u2019re getting premium audits that are flattering results a little bit. Can you just talk about kind of exposure unit growth? And to what degree that impacted the overall premium growth in the quarter?\nSteve Spray: Sure. So on -- for commercial lines all in, I would say that for the premium increase, about -- it\u2019s about half rate and about half exposure.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of James Bach from KBW.\nJames Bach: So you mentioned that the percent of paid losses to incurred was up. And I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail on the negative 35% in IBNR that was reported for commercial lines on the quarter, just kind of some more detail on that?\nSteve Johnston : Well, I think our actuaries, they look at a variety of methodologies. They use several methods. They look at a lot of different data points. In addition to paid losses, they'll look at case reserves, incurred losses, try to get an estimate for what we're seeing in terms of inflationary factors and set the best estimate that we can every quarter. And I think it's been a good track record now with 31 or 32 years in a row now where we've had favorable development. So we're very confident, it's an experienced team that hasn't changed over the years and feel comfortable with the estimates that they're making.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over back to our CEO, Mr. Steven Johnston, for any closing remarks. Sir?\nSteve Johnston : Thank you, Grace. Excellent job with the call. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you -- with you again on our fourth quarter call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. Overall, it was another good quarter. While weather-related catastrophes were lower than a year ago, communities across our country were impacted by hail, wind, flooding and fire. As we send our field claims associates into these communities, they shine, providing excellent service in reassuring affected families and businesses. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 fell $331 million compared with the third quarter of last year due to $457 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.  Equity portfolio fair value changes have caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters recently, and net income increased $1.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared with a year ago, despite the third quarter decrease. Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2021 more than tripled, up $146 million or 232% versus a year ago, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis contributing $31 million of the increase.  Our 92.6% third quarter 2021 property casualty combined ratio was 11 percentage points better than last year, with decreased catastrophe losses this year, representing 4.1 points of the improvement. Our current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.5 percentage points better than the first 9 months of 2020. Premium growth continued at a nice pace during the quarter as a strengthening economy and great relationships we enjoy with our agents helped us grow ahead of industry estimates.  Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the third quarter of 2021. We continue to focus on risk segmentation, giving our underwriters the tools they need to retain and write more profitable accounts while walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. Renewal pricing during the third quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial lines insurance segment again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average renewal price increases, down slightly from the second quarter.  Our third quarter personal lines segment average renewal price increases slowed a little compared with the second quarter, including personal auto in the low-single-digit range, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high-single-digit range. Our commercial lines segment had an outstanding quarter with this 80.6% combined ratio improving by 21.8 percentage points compared with the third quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 10%.  For our personal lines segment, third quarter net written premiums grew 7% as it continued to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter 2021 combined ratio was higher than a year ago, largely due to driving patterns moving towards pre-pandemic levels, increasing our personal auto loss ratio.  Personal auto still produced a small underwriting profit for the third quarter and for the first 9 months of 2021, our personal lines segment in total had an underwriting profit.  Our excess and surplus line segment produced a sub-95% combined ratio for the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year and grew third quarter net written premiums by 30%. The Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each grew net written premiums in the third quarter of 2021. While both experienced significant losses from Hurricane Ida leading to underwriting losses for the quarter, we weren't surprised by the level of loss we saw for an event of this magnitude based on our models. Our life insurance subsidiary produced third quarter 2021 net income of $11 million and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 8%. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results measured as net income before investment gains were the largest component of our VCR for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. VCR through September 30, 2021, was 12.4%, already reaching our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add perspective on some other areas of our financial performance. Thank you, Mike. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to demand flexibility in how we accomplish our day-to-day tasks. However, by staying focused on the steady execution of our long-term initiatives, we are able to keep producing these strong results. We have the people, the technology and the drive to continue delivering strong value for shareholders for years to come.

Investment income grew nicely during the third quarter of 2021, up 7% compared with the same period a year ago. Third quarter dividend income was up 11%, and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $153 million for the first 9 months of the year. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 7%, and the pretax average yield was 4.06%, up 3 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of 2021 was 3.43%. Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority with net purchases during the first 9 months of the year totaling $694 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2021 were modestly unfavorable for both our stock and bond portfolios.  The overall third quarter net loss was $158 million before tax effects, including $105 million for our equity holdings and $80 million for our bond holdings. At the end of the third quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion, including $5.8 billion for our equity securities. Cash flow was very strong in the third quarter, as it has been all year. It contributes to investment income and was a major factor in the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the third quarter. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2021 generated $1.5 billion, a 36% increase compared with a year ago period. Expense management is another area we focus, always trying to optimize the balance of strategic business investments and expense controls. The third quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than last year's third quarter, including 1.2 points due to higher accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. Moving on to loss reserves. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the third quarter of 2021, we experienced $102 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. It favorably contributed to the combined ratio by 6.4% for the quarter.  On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of the year was favorable by $225 million for 2020, $46 million for 2019, $39 million for 2018 and $21 million in aggregate for all accident years prior to 2018. Regarding capital management, we also follow a consistent approach, including share repurchases as part of a maintenance intended to offset issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. We believe that our quarter end financial strength was in good shape and provides plenty of financial flexibility. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares at an average price per share of $119.3. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I typically do, with a summary of third quarter contributions to the book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.  Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.59. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.05. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $0.39.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s Chief Insurance Officer, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I\u2019ll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We had another quarter of strong operating performance as we remain focused on steady progress toward profitably growing our insurance business over time. Financial results benefited from several areas, including excellent investment management and ongoing efforts to continually improve insurance operations. Net income for the second quarter of 2021 decreased by $206 million compared with the second quarter of last year, primarily due to $439 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Equity portfolio fair value changes caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters since early 2020. And net income for the first six months of 2021 increased by $1.6 billion from a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was up $221 million or 311% for the quarter, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis, contributing $136 million of the increase. Our 85.5% property casualty combined ratio was 17.6 percentage points better than a year ago, with decreased catastrophe losses in the second quarter representing 12.6 points of the improvement. The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.0 percentage points better than last year for the second quarter and 3.5 points better on a six-month basis. Our underwriters emphasize segmentation of risks, working to retain more profitable accounts, and obtaining better pricing on business that we identify as less profitable. At the same time, we are diversifying risks by product line and geography while excellent service from our claims operation also helps grow our business. Premiums grew at an impressive rate for the second quarter in a row, reflecting expertise and focus by our associates and great production by the premier independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to believe we are growing profitably by combining data and judgment as we underwrite and price business. We also recognize the importance of remaining disciplined and walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. Renewal pricing during the second quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial and personal lines insurance segments, again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average price increases, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Each insurance segment grew its business and produced improved profit compared with the second quarter a year ago. Our commercial lines segment had superb results with its 84.2% combined ratio improving by 14.9 percentage points compared with the second quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 8%. For our personal lines segment, second-quarter net written premiums grew 4%, continuing to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its combined ratio of 92.7% also improved significantly, down 19.6 percentage points from the second quarter a year ago. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a combined ratio below 90%, while also growing net written premiums by an impressive 26% and posting favorable reserve development on prior accident years for the third time in the past four quarters. Cincinnati Re continued its strong diversified and profitable growth as net written premiums grew 62% in the second quarter, with an excellent combined ratio of nearly 80%. Its seasoned, talented team, is taking advantage of firmer reinsurance pricing, while at the same time, maintaining underwriting discipline as they typically decline three out of four opportunities to write new reinsurance contracts among hundreds that they are routinely submitted in a quarter. Cincinnati Global again produced a fine underwriting profit with an exceptional loss and loss expense ratio as favorable reserve development on prior accident year catastrophes offset most of its other losses. Its net written premiums decreased a little as underwriters have been reducing catastrophe loss risk while growing some newer lines of business. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter, reporting second-quarter net income up 17% from a year ago and growing life insurance earned premiums by 2%. I\u2019ll conclude with the value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 7.3% for the second quarter and 11.6% for the first half of the year. The contribution from operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4.8% for the first six months of 2021, up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on a few other important areas of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you joining us today. Our investment portfolio continued to perform very well during the second quarter of 2021, including investment income growth of 5%. Dividend income was up 13% for the second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. For the first half of the year, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $42 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3% and the pre-tax average yield was 4.02%, down nine basis points from the second quarter a year ago. The yield on a six-month basis matched last year\u2019s first half. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2021 was 3.33%. Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority, with net purchases during the first six months of the year totaling $465 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2021 were favorable for both our stock portfolio and our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $652 million before tax effects, including $489 million for our equity portfolio and $141 million for our bond portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.9 billion, including $5.9 billion in our equity portfolio. We had another quarter of strong cash flow, again, contributing to investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first six months of 2021 generated $917 million, up 49% from a year ago. Expense management is always an important matter as we work to achieve a good balance between strategic business investments and expense controls. The second quarter of 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year\u2019s second quarter which included a stay-at-home policyholder credit for personal auto policies and higher credit losses due to uncollectible premiums. The second-quarter ratio was higher than the first quarter of this year, largely due to higher accruals related to profit sharing in the second quarter and lower expenses in the first quarter that benefited from less business travel. Next, I\u2019ll highlight a few items regarding loss reserves and reinsurance. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2021, we experienced $119 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.8% for the quarter. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Based on our study of new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. Together, our workers\u2019 compensation and commercial casualty lines of business represent about half of our $7 billion quarter-end total gross property casualty loss and loss expense reserves and they had the largest amounts of second-quarter favorable net reserve development. Workers\u2019 compensation has the longest tail as claims can remain open for many years. While the amount of reserve release for any given accident year was relatively small, the aggregate amount was $27 million. Commercial casualty paid loss development by accident year over time is an important factor in estimating ultimate losses. Calendar-year basis data is not as useful. For example, while the second-quarter 2021 paid loss total for commercial casualty was higher than a year ago, for the first six months of 2021, it was 15% less than what we saw prior to the pandemic in the first half of 2019 despite earned premiums that were 13% higher in 2021. Net favorable reserve development during the second quarter was concentrated in the four most recent accident years, including a little more than two-thirds for accident years 2017 through 2019. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first half of the year was favorable by $170 million for 2020, $26 million for 2019, $15 million for 2018, and $80 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. Nearly 80% of the 2020 amount was for property or auto lines of business, which have a much shorter tail than workers\u2019 compensation or commercial casualty. Regarding reinsurance, we disclosed in our 10-Q that we non-renewed our combined property catastrophe occurrence excess of loss treaty that provided up to $50 million of coverage for business written on a direct basis and by Cincinnati Re. And we restructured the reinsurance program in place for Cincinnati Re only that provides property catastrophe excess of loss coverage now with a total available aggregate limit of $48 million. Another reinsurance detail we disclosed pertains to cyber insurance that we offer as an affirmative coverage option on various policies. Some recent industry reports indicate that on a direct written premium basis, Cincinnati Insurance is among the 20 largest cyber insurers in the U.S. Premiums for those policies are ceded to a reinsurer, therefore transferring substantially all of that risk. I\u2019ll briefly comment on capital management. Our approach remains consistent, and we ended the quarter with outstanding financial strength and financial flexibility. In typical fashion, I\u2019ll wrap up my prepared [Technical Difficulty] our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.08. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.80. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.69. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.40. And we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.41 per share during the second quarter to a record-high $73.57 per share. And now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. It\u2019s satisfying to see the steady execution of our initiatives producing these strong results. In June and July brought a return of business travel and a return of our headquarters associates working together in person, it\u2019s wonderful to see so many familiar faces in the hallway and to be able to get out from behind our desks to visit with agents and our field teams across the country. This return to a bit of normalcy has produced an energy that you can feel across our organization, bringing with it lots of optimism for the future of Cincinnati Financial. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hoffer. Polly, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Derek Han with KBW.\nDerek Han: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Yes. I just had a question on the commercial growth. You\u2019ve obviously had impressive commercial growth in the second quarter at 7.6%. But just given the rapid economic normalization that you\u2019ve talked about, I would have maybe expected the premium growth to be a little higher. Was that just a function of prudent cycle management that you\u2019ve had in the past, maybe non-renewing some of the unprofitable businesses?\nSteve Spray: Hi, Derek. This is Steve Spray. Yes. I think it\u2019s a great question. Our new business for commercial lines has continued to improve throughout the first half of this year, getting back post, I guess, pre-COVID. And it\u2019s always a balance between the growth and profitability. And the way our new business underwriters in the field and our headquarters underwriters here are executing on pricing sophistication, pricing segmentation and just balancing that with new business growth, we\u2019re pretty pleased with where we are now and candidly feel like we\u2019ve got a good runway ahead of us to continue as we get back to calling agents face to face and taking advantage of those opportunities.\nDerek Han: Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And just on a related note, you previously guided for 6% or higher top-line growth for this year. Your first half is obviously well above the 6% mark. And the second-quarter growth of 9.9% wasn\u2019t really driven by easier comps. So how should we think about the growth in the second half, including commercial?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. Thanks, Derek. This is Steve Johnston. And we feel good about the growth in total, and it\u2019s coming really from all of our segments. I would point out that Cincinnati Re represented 5 percentage points of the 11% growth for the first half. And I think we hope that market conditions continue to be just as they are with the reinsurance market, but there\u2019s always a chance that can change. I guess there\u2019s just uncertainty, the economy could weaken. So there are things that could impact the growth, but we really do feel good about our growth, good about our growth prospects, really confident in the business that Cincinnati Re is bringing to us with their growth and really across every one of our operational areas.\nDerek Han: Got it. Thanks. And if I can squeeze just one more question in, within workers\u2019 comp, you had material favorable reserve development, but the core loss-share kind of picked up higher sequentially. Is there a driver behind that?\nSteve Johnston: I think with the workers\u2019 comp just there\u2019s been rate pressure. Throughout the industry, there\u2019s been a lot of talk of it kind of maybe bottoming out and so forth. That has had an impact. But I think our team has just done a great job with the workers\u2019 compensation in terms of pricing, underwriting, segmenting the business. And so we feel good about our prospects and workers\u2019 compensation over the little bit longer term.\nDerek Han: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for all the answers.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle: Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, maybe looking first at personal lines, I guess it was a very good result in the quarter. I guess I was a little bit surprised that the accident year margin, actually, it was a little bit better in the second quarter than in the first quarter. It did obviously deteriorate against a year ago, but not nearly by as much as we\u2019ve seen with a lot of other personal lines writers given all of the increased business activity back to work more normal driving behavior. So I was just \u2013 I was curious to see what you were seeing in the data that might kind of outline with that?\nSteve Spray: Mark, Steve Spray again, and maybe Steve Johnston and I can tag team on this one. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve really had to take some specific \u2013 or some underwriting on pricing actions specific states. And I think that is showing up in the results. At the same time, we\u2019ve continued to build out our pricing sophistication tools, segmentation, and personal lines and you can see that showing up and improving our new business results as well. So I think that \u2013 hopefully, that gets to the question as far as just the improved results. It\u2019s on multiple fronts and specifically taking some more aggressive action in some specific states that have needed it. And you can also see that, that\u2019s putting some pressure just on the net written premium growth as well.\nMark Dwelle: Within your personal lines, what percentage of the business is sort of auto-related as compared to homeowners-related?\nMike Sewell: Yes. We have that here for the quarter. The personal lines written premium was $166 million \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the personal auto written premium was $166 million; homeowners $211 million; and then the other personal, which would be everything that goes with the Inland Marine and so forth of $62 million.\nMark Dwelle: Yes. That\u2019s probably a factor as well. You\u2019ve got a richer homeowners mix than many peers do. Okay. Thanks for that. The second question that I had really related to the commercial lines, you partly addressed it earlier, but in thinking about the overall growth rate in the quarter for premiums, how would you \u2013 if you had to just generally segment between growth that was driven by exposure unit growth at your customers, just expanded unit counts or underlying policy size versus just true price, an easy way to kind of divide that up?\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think I would say it\u2019s a little bit of all of it, Mark. This is Steve Spray again. Price is certainly making an impact there, retention. And then we are seeing exposures in our commercial lines book returned to almost \u2013 they\u2019re getting close to pre-COVID exposure basis. And it really depends on I think probably for any carrier, especially for us, just your mix as well in different segments, different industry segments are impacted differently from COVID. Just as an example, construction, and manufacturing, real estate all held up pretty well throughout COVID and in the first half of 2021. And so that we have a fair amount of that business on our books and some other industry segments maybe didn\u2019t fare as well and would impact us less also. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. I appreciate that. And then two other questions. One, could you just provide a kind of a general update on some of the business interruption litigation that I mean, this time it was the only thing we could talk about this time a year ago. Obviously, a certain amount of time has passed, and just kind of an update on what you continue to see and what proportion of the reserves that are set up a year ago might still remain in IBNR?\nSteve Johnston: Sure. I\u2019ll take that one, Mark. And I think it\u2019s fair to say that our BI litigation continues to progress pretty well. During the quarter, we received the first appellate court decision that considered our policy language and it confirmed that there was no coverage. And the overwhelming majority of trial courts from across the country continue to apply the policy language as we had anticipated. We\u2019ve said before that we believe our policy language that requires direct physical loss or damage to property to trigger coverage is clear and that the virus does not cause direct physical loss or damage to property. So we think that the BI litigation continues to progress pretty well. In terms of the amounts, they have been relatively consistent with really no material changes during the quarter.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Thank you for that. And then just one last question, within \u2013 and this is just kind of getting used to these new business units. Within Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, are either of those businesses likely to have exposure to some of the flooding that has been occurring in Europe recently?\nSteve Johnston: We\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on that, and we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a material exposure there. It\u2019s still early from everything, we can tell to this point, no material damage there.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Thanks for that. Those are all my questions.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mark. Excellent questions.\nOperator: And thank you. And at this time, there are no further audio questions. We\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Johnston for closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Polly, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call. Have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, and thank all of you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. We had another quarter of strong operating performance as we remain focused on steady progress toward profitably growing our insurance business over time. Financial results benefited from several areas, including excellent investment management and ongoing efforts to continually improve insurance operations. Net income for the second quarter of 2021 decreased by $206 million compared with the second quarter of last year, primarily due to $439 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Equity portfolio fair value changes caused significant earnings volatility for several quarters since early 2020. And net income for the first six months of 2021 increased by $1.6 billion from a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was up $221 million or 311% for the quarter, with lower catastrophe losses on an after-tax basis, contributing $136 million of the increase. Our 85.5% property casualty combined ratio was 17.6 percentage points better than a year ago, with decreased catastrophe losses in the second quarter representing 12.6 points of the improvement. The current accident year combined ratio before catastrophe loss effects also continued to improve and was 2.0 percentage points better than last year for the second quarter and 3.5 points better on a six-month basis. Our underwriters emphasize segmentation of risks, working to retain more profitable accounts, and obtaining better pricing on business that we identify as less profitable. At the same time, we are diversifying risks by product line and geography while excellent service from our claims operation also helps grow our business. Premiums grew at an impressive rate for the second quarter in a row, reflecting expertise and focus by our associates and great production by the premier independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to believe we are growing profitably by combining data and judgment as we underwrite and price business. We also recognize the importance of remaining disciplined and walking away from opportunities when we determine pricing is inadequate. Renewal pricing during the second quarter continued to be ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment. Our commercial and personal lines insurance segments, again experienced mid-single-digit percentage range estimated average price increases, while the excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Each insurance segment grew its business and produced improved profit compared with the second quarter a year ago. Our commercial lines segment had superb results with its 84.2% combined ratio improving by 14.9 percentage points compared with the second quarter a year ago and growing net written premiums by 8%. For our personal lines segment, second-quarter net written premiums grew 4%, continuing to benefit from planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its combined ratio of 92.7% also improved significantly, down 19.6 percentage points from the second quarter a year ago. Our excess and surplus line segment produced a combined ratio below 90%, while also growing net written premiums by an impressive 26% and posting favorable reserve development on prior accident years for the third time in the past four quarters. Cincinnati Re continued its strong diversified and profitable growth as net written premiums grew 62% in the second quarter, with an excellent combined ratio of nearly 80%. Its seasoned, talented team, is taking advantage of firmer reinsurance pricing, while at the same time, maintaining underwriting discipline as they typically decline three out of four opportunities to write new reinsurance contracts among hundreds that they are routinely submitted in a quarter. Cincinnati Global again produced a fine underwriting profit with an exceptional loss and loss expense ratio as favorable reserve development on prior accident year catastrophes offset most of its other losses. Its net written premiums decreased a little as underwriters have been reducing catastrophe loss risk while growing some newer lines of business. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter, reporting second-quarter net income up 17% from a year ago and growing life insurance earned premiums by 2%. I'll conclude with the value-creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Strong operating results and favorable securities markets produced an excellent VCR at 7.3% for the second quarter and 11.6% for the first half of the year. The contribution from operations measured as net income before investment gains was 4.8% for the first six months of 2021, up 2.7 percentage points from a year ago. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will comment on a few other important areas of our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. It's satisfying to see the steady execution of our initiatives producing these strong results. In June and July brought a return of business travel and a return of our headquarters associates working together in person, it's wonderful to see so many familiar faces in the hallway and to be able to get out from behind our desks to visit with agents and our field teams across the country.

As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck, and Theresa Hoffer. Polly, please open the call for questions. Yes. Thanks, Derek. This is Steve Johnston. And we feel good about the growth in total, and it's coming really from all of our segments. I would point out that Cincinnati Re represented 5 percentage points of the 11% growth for the first half. And I think we hope that market conditions continue to be just as they are with the reinsurance market, but there's always a chance that can change.

So there are things that could impact the growth, but we really do feel good about our growth, good about our growth prospects, really confident in the business that Cincinnati Re is bringing to us with their growth and really across every one of our operational areas.

            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you joining us today. Our investment portfolio continued to perform very well during the second quarter of 2021, including investment income growth of 5%. Dividend income was up 13% for the second quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. For the first half of the year, net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $42 million. Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 3% and the pre-tax average yield was 4.02%, down nine basis points from the second quarter a year ago. The yield on a six-month basis matched last year's first half. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2021 was 3.33%. Investing in the fixed maturity portfolio continues to be a priority, with net purchases during the first six months of the year totaling $465 million. Investment portfolio valuation changes for the second quarter of 2021 were favorable for both our stock portfolio and our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $652 million before tax effects, including $489 million for our equity portfolio and $141 million for our bond portfolio. At the end of the second quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.9 billion, including $5.9 billion in our equity portfolio. We had another quarter of strong cash flow, again, contributing to investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first six months of 2021 generated $917 million, up 49% from a year ago. Expense management is always an important matter as we work to achieve a good balance between strategic business investments and expense controls. The second quarter of 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year's second quarter which included a stay-at-home policyholder credit for personal auto policies and higher credit losses due to uncollectible premiums. The second-quarter ratio was higher than the first quarter of this year, largely due to higher accruals related to profit sharing in the second quarter and lower expenses in the first quarter that benefited from less business travel. Next, I'll highlight a few items regarding loss reserves and reinsurance. Our approach to reserving remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the second quarter of 2021, we experienced $119 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.8% for the quarter. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Based on our study of new data during the year, we update estimates as needed. Together, our workers' compensation and commercial casualty lines of business represent about half of our $7 billion quarter-end total gross property casualty loss and loss expense reserves and they had the largest amounts of second-quarter favorable net reserve development. Workers' compensation has the longest tail as claims can remain open for many years. While the amount of reserve release for any given accident year was relatively small, the aggregate amount was $27 million. Commercial casualty paid loss development by accident year over time is an important factor in estimating ultimate losses. Calendar-year basis data is not as useful. For example, while the second-quarter 2021 paid loss total for commercial casualty was higher than a year ago, for the first six months of 2021, it was 15% less than what we saw prior to the pandemic in the first half of 2019 despite earned premiums that were 13% higher in 2021. Net favorable reserve development during the second quarter was concentrated in the four most recent accident years, including a little more than two-thirds for accident years 2017 through 2019. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first half of the year was favorable by $170 million for 2020, $26 million for 2019, $15 million for 2018, and $80 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2018. Nearly 80% of the 2020 amount was for property or auto lines of business, which have a much shorter tail than workers' compensation or commercial casualty. Regarding reinsurance, we disclosed in our 10-Q that we non-renewed our combined property catastrophe occurrence excess of loss treaty that provided up to $50 million of coverage for business written on a direct basis and by Cincinnati Re. And we restructured the reinsurance program in place for Cincinnati Re only that provides property catastrophe excess of loss coverage now with a total available aggregate limit of $48 million. Another reinsurance detail we disclosed pertains to cyber insurance that we offer as an affirmative coverage option on various policies. Some recent industry reports indicate that on a direct written premium basis, Cincinnati Insurance is among the 20 largest cyber insurers in the U.S. Premiums for those policies are ceded to a reinsurer, therefore transferring substantially all of that risk. I'll briefly comment on capital management. Our approach remains consistent, and we ended the quarter with outstanding financial strength and financial flexibility. In typical fashion, I'll wrap up my prepared [Technical Difficulty] our value-creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $1.08. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.07. Investment income other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.80. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $0.69. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.40. And we declared $0.63 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $4.41 per share during the second quarter to a record-high $73.57 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Yes. We have that here for the quarter. The personal lines written premium was $166 million \u2013 I'm sorry, the personal auto written premium was $166 million; homeowners $211 million; and then the other personal, which would be everything that goes with the Inland Marine and so forth of $62 million."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. . Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We were pleased with operating performance, and believe it reflects our proven strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term.  Net income for the first quarter of 2021 rose by $1.8 billion compared with the first quarter a year ago, and included increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income was up $85 million or 62% for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses, reducing it on an after-tax basis by $21 million more than last year. Our 91.2% property casualty combined ratio was 7.3 percentage points better than a year ago, with elevated catastrophe losses this year causing an increase of 1.3 points.  The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects continued to improve and was 2.3 percentage points better than the same quarter a year ago.  Our results continue to benefit from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography, and likewise, from segmentation of risks as we underwrite and price policies. While economic effects of the pandemic and pricing discipline continued to slow commercial lines' new business premium growth, we believe we are growing our business profitably, and our relationships with the independent agents who represent us are as strong as ever. \nMichael Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2021 investment performance was quite good as investment income grew 5%. Dividend income rose 9% for the first quarter and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $13 million.  Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 5% compared with the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.14%, up 10 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter was 3.71%. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio, with net purchases during the first three months of the year totaling $137 million.  Investment portfolio valuation changes for the first quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock portfolio, but unfavorable for our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $308 million before tax effects, including $491 million for our equity portfolio, offsetting a decrease of $193 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio net appreciated value of approximately $6.3 billion, including $5.4 billion in our equity portfolio.  Cash flow continues to help boost investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2021 was very strong, and generated $354 million, up 112% from a year ago.  Expense management is always an important matter and we aim to balance strategic business investments with expense controls. The first quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 3.0 percentage points lower than last year's first quarter. The pandemic continued to cause lower spending for several items, such as business travel. We expect some of those expenses could return to a more normal rate in future quarters as restrictions lift and people feel more comfortable meeting in person.  In terms of loss reserves, our consistent approach aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a fair amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.4 percentage points for the quarter or $110 million, and was higher than a typical quarter. \nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Mike. Before we close, I want to thank our associates for their continued focus and dedication. While still balancing serving customers and ever-changing pandemic conditions, our claims associates, both in the field and at headquarters, worked together to deliver our hallmark of fair and empathetic claim service to the many policyholders impacted by severe winter weather over the past few months.  We've continued to release new products and services, creating additional ways to help the independent agents who represent us, grow profitably and offer value to their clients.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital. \nMark Dwelle: A couple of questions. I was hoping you could talk through a little bit more detail related to \u2013 the prior reserve release related to the catastrophe events. Are those like 2020 events? Or do they go back further than that? Very unusual to have such a large adjustment for cats?\nMichael Sewell: That's a great question. I appreciate it. It does seem a little high. So it was 2 points in total for the prior-year development. The largest, really, when you look at it, was coming through on our primary business related to 2020 cats, but it was widespread. There was at least 10 cats in there where we had $1 million to $2 million favorable adjustments. And then there was many other smaller items that were below the $1 million range.  When you also look at CGU, it was really concentrated around three items. The first one was Delta. That was in 2020. That was about a $5 million favorable adjustment. Sally, that was also in 2020. That was a $3 million adjustment. And then I think it was the previous year, there was the Australia wildfire, and that was $2 million. So, when you add it all up, it's about $30 million, and that's your 2 points of favorable development on cats.\nMark Dwelle: I see. So, ultimately, this was more about, like, as you said, almost a dozen small adjustments rather than one big adjustment where you kind of miscalled it or something?\nMichael Sewell: That's exactly right, Mark. You hit it. Thank you. That was a great question.\nMark Dwelle: The second question that I had related to the sizable level of growth in Cincinnati Re. Again, that's a fairly new business unit. So, I'm not really used to what the \u2013 it doesn't have a lot of historical run rate data. So, I guess, I'm curious, two things. One is kind of where you saw opportunity that prompted such a large increase in writing. And then maybe thinking a little bit longer term, how you think about that business and how large that business might be relative to \u2013 it's, obviously, going to be smaller than the core business. But how large would you suppose that could eventually become?\nSteven Johnston: Good question. This is Steve Johnston. Basically, the short answer is, we just have a talented team there that's well connected, and they're supported by great financial strength here of the organization that just had the opportunity to take advantage of firming prices, firming conditions.  And it is an allocated capital model. We didn't form a Cincinnati Re. It's written on the Cincinnati Insurance Company paper. It's got the full strength of our balance sheet. And what we ask is that they just opportunistically try to estimate how much capital they would need for each contract that they enter into. And if we can hit the hurdle rate and if it can be diversified the way we want it to be, then we want them to grow.  If things would turn and go in the other direction, that's an area where it could turn and go in the other direction in terms of writings if the market would turn. But in this quarter, really, across the board, Cincinnati Re had opportunity to take advantage of firming prices and improving terms and conditions and to grow the way they did. \nMark Dwelle: Was the growth primarily in property-oriented lines? Or was it casualty-oriented or maybe a mix?\nMichael Sewell: It was across the board. It maybe have been a little bit more casualty and specialty. But it was across the board where we saw opportunity for good pricing and fair terms and conditions.\nMark Dwelle: I guess, my last question, really just \u2013 you commented a little bit in the opening remarks, but just in terms of the market conditions, the pricing behavior that you're seeing, would you characterize the pricing environment as continuing to improve? Or is it beginning to stabilize a little bit that while it's still at positive pricing levels?\nSteven Johnston: As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do feel that we're getting rate that's ahead of loss cost trends. And I think what's important is that we are looking at this policy by policy, coverage by coverage, state by state. It's more of a ground-up approach than a top-down approach. And we still \u2013 we see a consistent pricing environment. I have heard some industry comments that it might be tapering off a little bit. But as you look back through history, our increases may have been a little bit less than others over that period of time. I think that's driven a lot by mix and all the details that I described, and we are just taking our steady approach forward that we think is appreciated by our agents and their clients and getting fair and adequate pricing, risk by risk, policy by policy.\nMark Dwelle: Do you think your multiyear policies approach, do you think that that enhances your ability to capture rate as the market moves or does it inhibit it?\nSteven Johnston: Well, it's a steadying influence, Mark. I think as rates go up, we will have prices that are in position for three years, same when they go down. The retention is very high on the three-year policies and we just think that stable long-term approach to relationships with our agents and their customers is a winning formula that's proven to work well for us for decades really. And we think we can manage it with the experience we have in it in terms of pricing appropriately for the three-year contracts.\nOperator: Thank you. . There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Johnston. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Patricia. And thank you for joining us today. We hope some of you will join us for our virtual shareholder meeting on Saturday, May 8 at 9:30 AM Eastern. While we intend to resume in-person meetings at some point in the future, for now, virtual meetings are the best way to keep shareholders, agents and associates safe. Please visit www.cinfin.com for details on how to register for the meeting. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Thank you.

            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter 2021 investment performance was quite good as investment income grew 5%. Dividend income rose 9% for the first quarter and net purchases for the equity portfolio totaled $13 million.  Interest income from our bond portfolio grew 5% compared with the same quarter a year ago. The pretax average yield was 4.14%, up 10 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter was 3.71%. We continue to invest in the fixed maturity portfolio, with net purchases during the first three months of the year totaling $137 million.  Investment portfolio valuation changes for the first quarter of 2021 were favorable for our stock portfolio, but unfavorable for our bond portfolio. The overall net gain was $308 million before tax effects, including $491 million for our equity portfolio, offsetting a decrease of $193 million for our bond portfolio. We ended the quarter with total investment portfolio net appreciated value of approximately $6.3 billion, including $5.4 billion in our equity portfolio.  Cash flow continues to help boost investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2021 was very strong, and generated $354 million, up 112% from a year ago.  Expense management is always an important matter and we aim to balance strategic business investments with expense controls. The first quarter 2021 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 3.0 percentage points lower than last year's first quarter. The pandemic continued to cause lower spending for several items, such as business travel. We expect some of those expenses could return to a more normal rate in future quarters as restrictions lift and people feel more comfortable meeting in person.  In terms of loss reserves, our consistent approach aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced a fair amount of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years. The combined ratio effect was 7.4 percentage points for the quarter or $110 million, and was higher than a typical quarter. That's a great question. I appreciate it. It does seem a little high. So it was 2 points in total for the prior-year development. The largest, really, when you look at it, was coming through on our primary business related to 2020 cats, but it was widespread.

It was across the board. It maybe have been a little bit more casualty and specialty. But it was across the board where we saw opportunity for good pricing and fair terms and conditions."

            "content": "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. We were pleased with operating performance, and believe it reflects our proven strategy and careful execution as we seek to continue growing profitably over the long term.  Net income for the first quarter of 2021 rose by $1.8 billion compared with the first quarter a year ago, and included increases in the fair value of our equity security portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income was up $85 million or 62% for the quarter despite higher catastrophe losses, reducing it on an after-tax basis by $21 million more than last year. Our 91.2% property casualty combined ratio was 7.3 percentage points better than a year ago, with elevated catastrophe losses this year causing an increase of 1.3 points.  The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects continued to improve and was 2.3 percentage points better than the same quarter a year ago.  Our results continue to benefit from efforts to diversify risks by product line and geography, and likewise, from segmentation of risks as we underwrite and price policies. While economic effects of the pandemic and pricing discipline continued to slow commercial lines' new business premium growth, we believe we are growing our business profitably, and our relationships with the independent agents who represent us are as strong as ever. Thank you, Mike. Before we close, I want to thank our associates for their continued focus and dedication.

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray, and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Investment Officer, Steve Solaria, Chief Claims Officer, Mark Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We see positive momentum in several areas and are bullish (ph) about our future prospects despite 2022 financial results that were somewhat below our expectations. Challenges during the year included elevated inflation and higher losses from natural catastrophe events for us and the property casualty industry, in addition to the market volatility affecting the valuation of investment portfolios. Our experience in managing adversity, coupled with the company's financial strength allows us to maintain a long-term view and supports our confidence as we execute our plans. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was just over $1 billion, that's 31% or $457 million less than last year's outstanding fourth quarter, largely due to $307 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $202 million for the fourth quarter was down $118 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $66 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 94.9% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 10.7 percentage points higher than the 84.2% for the fourth quarter of last year, which was amongst the best combined ratios we've ever recorded. We think longer-term comparisons are also important. On a current accident year basis, excluding catastrophe losses, our 90.2% combined ratio compares favorably with each of the five years prior to 2020 and was 1.5 percentage points better than the average for that period with each accident year measured as of the respective year-end. On a calendar year basis, our 2022 combined ratio experienced a larger negative impact from catastrophe losses than in 2021, as they increased 4.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.2 points for the year. Inflation also pressured our combined ratio throughout 2022, contributing to less favorable results for both the current accident year and for reserve development on prior accident years as we have increased reserves for estimated ultimate losses. We've responded with actions to improve underwriting selection and pricing, including premium rate increases and increased expectations by underwriters as they factor inflationary trends into areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve results next year with a 2023 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2023 property casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends or some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. In recent quarters, we've noted that commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated. Although, still elevated in the fourth quarter, it was to a less degree than earlier in 2022. While recent profitability for our commercial umbrella business is not as strong as we previously estimated after strengthening reserves during 2020. The average combined ratio for the years 2018 through 2022 is still good, below 85% on a calendar year basis and below 90% on an accident year basis with development through year end 2022. Overall premium growth was very good and continues to incorporate pricing segmentation. Our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while also addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing. They do an excellent job serving Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies that are outstanding at producing business for us. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year 2022, that includes a 13% increase in fourth quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. In addition to exposures increases, our Commercial Lines Insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single digit percentage range, higher than the third quarter. Our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high-single digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were at the high end of the low-single digits with both auto and homeowner higher than in the third quarter. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates for our personal auto line of business will continue to rise. Based on our rate filings that have averaged low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10%. Policy retention rates improved from year end 2021 with our Commercial Lines segment moving higher in the upper 80% range. In our Personal Lines segment, rising to the low to mid-90% range. Moving on to highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. The Commercial Lines segment grew both fourth quarter and full year 2022 net written premiums 9%. Its combined ratio for both the quarter and full year 2022 was approximately 99%. That's above where we aim for and reflects elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses that were higher than a year ago. For our personal lines segment, net written premium grew 16% for the quarter and 15% for the full year 2022, as we continued our planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full year combined ratio was approximately 99% and reflected elevated inflation effects and is likewise above our near-term profit target. We have confidence that our proven long-term strategy and near-term actions we have taken will blend to improve results for both commercial and personal lines. Our Excess and Surplus Line segment finished the year with a 90.4% combined ratio, a good result, combined with 2022 net written premium growing 18%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each had another year of healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew full year 2022 net written premiums by 27% with a combined ratio of 97.4%. Cincinnati Global had a 2022 combined ratio of 88.9% with net written premiums growing 23%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its good performance with full year 2022 net income of $66 million, up 50% from a year ago and term life insurance earned premiums grew by 5%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. Our strong capital supports retaining additional risk and managing cost of rising reinsurance ceded premiums. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2023 are fairly similar to 2022, other than premium rate increases that averaged approximately 13%. The primary objective of our property casualty treaty -- catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is retaining a greater share of losses for layers of coverage than what was effect for 2022, while adding $92 million of coverage in a new layer between $900 million and $1.1 billion. In 2023, we'll retain all of the first $200 million of losses and the share of the next $900 million for a catastrophe event compared with 2022 when we retained the first $100 million and the share of the next $800 million. Should we experience a 2023 catastrophe event totaling $1.1 billion in losses, we'll retain $542 million compared with $499 million in 2022 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2023 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $130 million, approximately $16 million or 14% higher than the actual $114 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2022. Our investment department continued to perform quite well, and Mike will provide some details. Investments is another area where we like to keep an eye on longer-term trends. For example, for the five years ended with 2022, our equity portfolio, compound annual total shareholder return was 11.1%, 170 basis points better than the S&P 500 Index. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed favorably to VCR 2.1% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year 2022. The contribution from valuation of our investment portfolio was mixed, 10.5% favorable for the quarter, but unfavorable by 19.4% for the year due to challenges for both the stock and bond markets. A positive VCR of 12.8% for the quarter improved our 2022 full year VCR to negative 14.6%. Although that's below our expectations for a typical year, the 11.2% annual average over the past five years is within our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments about several other important points for evaluating our financial performance.\nMichael Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow at an outstanding pace, up 12% for the fourth quarter and 9% for full year 2022 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income rose 7% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during 2022 totaled $36 million. Bond interest income was up 11% in the fourth quarter. The pretax average yield of 4.16% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 17 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds continue to rise to 5.01% during full year 2022. We continue to emphasize investing in fixed maturity securities with net purchases during the year totaling $788 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2022 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was nearly $1.3 billion before tax effects, including an additional $230 million of unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of 2022, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $847 million. Cash flow, in addition to rising bond yields contributed to the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2022 generated almost $2.1 billion, a record high amount, up 4% from a year ago. For the fourth quarter of this year, it rose 36%. Turning to expense management. Our objective is to appropriately balance expense control with continuing to make strategic investments in our business. The full year 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year reflecting lower accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. We have now had $34 million of net favorable development on prior accident years. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During 2022, our net increase in the property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.029 billion, a 15% increase from the net reserve balance at year end 2021. The IBNR portion of that reserve addition was $765 million a further indication of the quality of our balance sheet. For full year 2022, we experienced $159 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points. Of that $159 million in net favorable development, $25 million of the net unfavorable amount from our commercial casualty lines of business, including an unfavorable $41 million for commercial umbrella and a net favorable $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the full year 2022 included favorable $96 million for 2021, favorable $124 million for 2020, unfavorable $72 million for 2019 and a favorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019. Our approach to capital management also remains consistent, and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe we have plenty of flexibility and also believe that our financial strength is in great shape. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased just over 101,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.55. As in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.47. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.10. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.83. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.14. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $5.15. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $7 per share during the fourth quarter to $67.01 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. We faced a number of challenges in 2022 and still recorded an underwriting profit for our insurance business. That result bolsters our belief that we'll see future benefits from our efforts to continually refine pricing precision and segmentation and our efforts to expand our geographic footprint and produce -- and product offerings. When you consider our financial strength, our experienced service-oriented associates and our Premier Agency force, I'm confident we'll be able to continue delivering shareholder value far into the future. Our Board of Directors shares that confidence and expressed it by increasing our quarterly cash dividend 9% last month, setting the stage for a 63 year of rising dividend payments. So that's not just paying the dividend for 63 straight years. That sets the stage for increasing the dividend for a 63 consecutive year. We believe that's a record that can only be matched by seven other publicly traded U.S. companies. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Cole, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Hello, Paul. Perhaps your line is muted.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, Paul. No worries.\nPaul Newsome: Congratulations on the year and the quarter.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nPaul Newsome: I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on investment income, which given the higher interest rates, your view on how much the portfolio yield could improve over the course of the year? And any thoughts on changing or different -- the allocation that you've had the last many years here in terms of buys versus equities and what you're doing within those fixed income as well?\nSteve Soloria: Paul, this is Steve Soloria here. Just in terms of moving forward, the allocation will remain virtually the same. We've taken advantage of the increase in rates over the course of the year to our benefits. We'll continue to do so, but we'll try and maintain an even keel and stay disciplined in our allocation moving forward. In terms of last year, as mentioned previously, the aggregates or kind of blended rate for the year was about 5%. Comparing that year-over-year, a year ago, we were at about 3.5%. So we picked up about 150 basis points on purchases over the year. Looking forward, as the Fed begins to hopefully slow down the rate increases, we'll probably see a bit of a pullback in the purchase yield moving forward, but we think we've booked some pretty nice yields over the course of the year, which will benefit us for the next eight to 10 years.\nPaul Newsome: Maybe as a second question, can you give us some further thoughts on claims inflation for the commercial line side of the house. Obviously, social inflation is top of mind to everyone in the business. And do you think the uptick in what you're doing with pricing is sufficient to overcome what you perceive as the prospective inflation improves.\nSteve Johnston: Yeah. Thanks, Paul. This is Steve. And we do see the inflation. As we just mentioned, have had our reserves developed favorably now for 34 years. And as a part of that, we try to be very prospective as we look at how we set our reserves and our pricing and be very prudent about it. And we do think that we are in a position for our rates to keep pace and exceed inflation. And I think that comes from a combination of the pure net rates that our net rate increases I went over in my fixed part of the call here and also exposure increases that we're getting both in personal and commercial lines.\nPaul Newsome: So do you think the underlying claims inflation is essentially less than combination of the exposure benefit plus the pure rate or do you think it's actually even lower than the pure rate at this point?\nSteve Johnston: I think the combination of the two, they're both kind of intertwined in terms of the overall premium that we're able to charge. And the exposure base does contemplate to a certain degree, the inflation and building costs and so forth.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you. Always appreciate the help guys. [Multiple Speakers]\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. This first question -- thank you for the commentary about the reinsurance renewals and I\u2019ll limit, I need, I\u2019ll need to kind of sit down and think through it on paper a bit more. So I'm asking this comes on the slide. But if I think back to historical guidance you've given us on the catastrophe load, I found back in '18, you kind of talked about 6 points to 7 points. Obviously, over the last few years, it's been, I think, directionally closer to 10, but it could be a bit off on the math. So kind of I guess, just given what the increased retentions and what way you just kind of discuss, should we become of splitting those two and thinking the new normal with what's going on in reinsurance is going to cause the catastrophe load to be kind of between the historical guidance and kind of what your last few years have been or just any help there would be great?\nSteve Johnston: Sure, Mike. This is Steve again. And I think what we really focus on is the loss ratio points. And what we've done really over a decade or more is to model all of our losses. And what we've been able to do is to push our accident year ex-cat down over a number of years. And that puts -- and then we also have grown our balance sheet significantly. And that puts us in a position, I think, that's enviable right now as reinsurance rates rise and that we can look at what we think we're getting in terms of price adequacy on our book, as well as protection of our balance sheet through our CAT program. And so while we don't give guidance on a cat loss ratio, I think that we do feel that we're in a good position in terms of the overall in managing both our accident year ex-cat showing 34 years of favorable reserve development and also managing our cat exposure across the company.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's I guess just then in the past, you've talked about the combined ratio target low to mid-90s. And also in the past, I'm talking about kind of 95 to 100. Is the -- just to be clear, is there is, one like more of a short-term versus a long-term target or has there anything changed given what's taking place with the insurance costs or maybe higher investment income is an offset to how you think about the mine ratio?\nSteve Johnston: You're right. Nothing has changed. The 95 to 100 is a longer-term target through all cycles in the low to mid-90s is what we're looking for in the shorter term for 2023.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And just maybe sticking -- moving to the commercial side of the portfolio. It feels like there's -- on the commercial property side, you're readjusting exposure and you'll get in front of that in terms of pushing rate on the commercial property side to get in front of inflationary trends. You said on the commercial umbrella side, though, that things remain elevated, but not as elevated as kind of how you had re-upped your loss picks in previous quarters. Anything you've learned kind of over the last three months on the commercial umbrella side piece of the business that has given you insights into maybe kind of the need to just re-shift the portfolio or anything that's maybe been distinct to CINCI and maybe not just reflective of the overall industry's social inflationary issues?\nSteve Spray: Yeah. Mike, Steve Spray. Great question. I really do think the driver is the elevated inflation effects that we're seeing. We look at -- as I've commented on the past, we look at every single large loss and just see if we can see any trends whatsoever, it still seems to be rather random in that umbrella excess line. Like we said last quarter, though, all hands on deck. The entire book needs rate. We are getting rate into the book to cover that inflation. But we underwrite every single risk on its own merits. And the vast, vast majority of the umbrella or excess policies we write. As a company, we write the underlying too. So we know the risk. We underwrite each risk, like I said, on its own merits, and we are looking at each risk, the pricing, the terms, conditions. We look at specific venues, specific fleets. So to determine how much capacity we want to put out there. So it's a -- and again, it's a risk by risk scenario that we do, but it needs -- the book needs of rate.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And maybe lastly on growth and maybe sticking with commercial lines, thinking about the growth outlook you laid out in the prepared remarks. Is there anything incremental that's coming from any initiatives that you would want to call out? I believe there's a -- about a small commercial BOP initiative or I'm sure there's other initiatives too or is it really just mostly pushing exposure adjustments and maybe some pricing power through '23?\nSteve Spray: I think it's -- again, Steve here, Mike. I think it's all of the above. I think it's exposure. I think it is rate. Steve alluded to, our retentions remain strong. You talked about our small business platform we call synergy that rollout is going extremely well. That's feedback from our agents, still pretty early in the game, but the rollout is going rapidly. We couldn't be happier with that. So we see a lot of good prospects there. Our E&S company continues to produce outstanding profitable results and strong growth. Personal lines, you see the growth there has been very, very strong as well, both on the high net worth and middle market. And I think we're confident and feel good that we're in a good position in personal lines and that we're a strong player, both middle market and now high net worth. High net worth is about 51% of our total premium. So the growth trajectory there has been extraordinary too.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Exciting things. Thank you for the answers.\nSteve Spray: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mark Dwelle with RBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Dwelle: Yeah. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, this is just kind of a numbers question. The level of dividend income within total investment income was up a little bit in the quarter and also for the full year. Is there anything in particular that is driving that other than -- I mean, I don't think average corporate rate dividend increases have been as high as 12%, but maybe they are.\nSteve Soloria: Mark, this is Steve Solaria. We did have a couple of unique factors over the course of the year. We did have two companies pay special dividends. LyondellBasell paid on early in the year, which was about $5 million. And then in December, CME usually pays a special dividend, but the dividend that they paid this year was well in excess of what we had expected. So those two special dividends really, really factored into the increase in dividend income year-over-year.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Thanks for that. And the second question, this is just a reiteration, I guess. Steven, I think it was in your comments talking about the reinsurance treaty, it's something and I'm just trying to write what I heard. So if you -- on a $1 billion of total losses, you would have $542 million of exposure in the new treaty versus $499 million. Is that -- that's $1 billion of aggregate losses or is that a single event loss?\nSteve Johnston: Yeah. No, good question, and I will clarify that a bit. So I wanted to make sure to kind of put things on an apples-to-apples comparison. So this year's program 2023 goes up to $1.1 billion. And so we have moved up a bit as our equity has grown, our GAAP equity has grown, our premium has grown, we feel we are in a position to move the program up a bit, but we wanted to buy more at the top end. So to put it kind of on an apples-to-apples basis, I used a hypothetical $1.1 billion loss for both years 2023 and 2022. And you're right on for the 2023 year, we would have $542 million of exposure. So that would include the $200 million up to the attachment point plus co-participations and that compares with $499 million for 2022 -- in the 2022 program.\nMark Dwelle: And then, again, just to clarify, that's on an aggregate basis for the full year or that's on a per event loss?\nSteve Johnston: Per event.\nMark Dwelle: Per event. Got it. So if there were $2 billion storms -- your two storms that cost Cincinnati Financial $1 billion in a year, then it would be double each of those respective figures, again, just for comparison.\nSteve Johnston: Right. We have reinstatement provisions in the contracts.\nMark Dwelle: Right. Of course. Okay. All right. Thanks for that. And then another question just -- can you remind me within Cincinnati Re, what proportion of that business is property and property catastrophe oriented as compared to being specialty or liability lines?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I have it. And you know it's interesting. We don't necessarily target a given percentage, but our 2022 full year in our inception to date are really pretty close. And for property, both from 2022 and inception to date, it's a little over 30% of the premium. For casualty, it's right in that 55% range. And for specialty, it's a little over 15% for the year in a little bit lower than that for the year-to-date, probably about 13%. So across time, it's been very consistent in that 30 plus range for property 53-ish for casualty and 15% or so for -- they didn't quite add up. I better make it get to 100%, so more like 30%, 55% and 15% across time.\nMark Dwelle: Any outlook you'd like to share on how your January 1 renewals might skew those percentages?\nSteve Johnston: No. I think it's a little early on the January 1's, but -- it's one nice thing as buyers of reinsurance, we're seeing the cost go up. It's almost like a little bit of a hedge in that we have Cincinnati Re, we've got very talented people there, very experienced people, and you see that shining through in a market like this. And they are benefiting from the firming rates and firming terms and conditions that you read about.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks for the answers.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Greg (ph) Carter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGrace Carter: Hi, everyone.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, Grace.\nGrace Carter: Good morning. I'm thinking about the guidance for 8% plus premium growth in 2023. Like we keep hearing about potential for a macro slowdown. I was just wondering if you could go over the macro assumptions that underpin that guidance.\nSteve Johnston: Yeah. That's a good point. At 13% for this year, that's the highest percentage growth in net rent premium we've had it since Insurance since 2001. And so we do recognize that there could be a slowdown. We're not predicting that necessarily or giving guidance on it, but it's possible as you point out, we want to be disciplined in our underwriting. Profit always comes first with us. And so our guidance is for a little bit less than what it was this year, but we are still very optimistic across all of our business areas in terms of the growth that we're seeing, the relationship we have with our agents, the technology we have, the models that we have, we feel very bullish about growth, but we did temper back a little bit from where we are for the full year, just to be cognizant of the points that you bring up, even though I wouldn't say that we're predicting it for sure.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And looking at the attritional loss ratios for commercial property and homeowners in the quarter, they were a bit improved versus the first nine months of the year. So I was just wondering, if there is any sort of change in trend regarding frequency or severity that you've observed for those lines or if this is just kind of normal variability just given the volatility of those lines can see?\nSteve Johnston: Grace, I'm sure there is some of that volatility that you can see, but I also know there's a lot of hard work that's been going on in addressing property. And it predates our addressing and say umbrella, for example. And it's nice to see the hard work of our underwriters and really everybody throughout the company chipping in here in terms of underwriting, loss control, pricing. And I do think it's paying off.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead. Hello, Mike. Perhaps your line is muted.\nMike Zaremski: Sorry. Thanks for seeking me in. So I\u2019m just going back to thinking about the combined ratio goals for the company. Are there specific lines of business you'd like to call out and maybe they're obvious, maybe it's commercial casualty and commercial property both. But were there kind of the most wood to chop when we're thinking about improving the combined ratio in outer years? I guess when we look at the pricing disclosure that you offer us the mid-single digit plus numbers. The pricing, I guess, isn't at levels that are, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, are like extremely high levels relative to inflationary levels. So just kind of curious where you feel you have the most wood to chop over the coming couple of years.\nSteve Johnston: Yeah. We haven't provided that any lower than at the company-wide level. And it's really because it's a big team effort. Every one of our operating areas is focused on profit improvement, and we're seeing it across the board from underwriting to claims to loss control in the pricing and underwriting part of it. We are reflecting on the property in the exposure, the increase in inflation. We are trying to reflect that. And we're also getting a pure net rate on top of that and really feel that with our accident year ex cat wood is and the underwriting that we're doing in terms of cat exposure and geographic diversification that we're in a good spot to hit the numbers that we gave in the comments.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And just when we think about kind of trajectory of potential improvement, should we be kind of just keeping in mind that there's some element of multiyear policies or that are coming -- that are within the portfolio or comps there kind of getting easier or maybe there's less multiyear policies than there were in the past. Any nuances there we should be cognizant of? Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Yeah, Mike, Steve Spray. And it kind of goes to your prior question, too, is those average for us, the as net rate change just doesn't tell the full story and the underwriters working with our agents in segmenting the book, the tools that they have in front of them to really focus on getting rate and terms, conditions on those policies, but we feel we are probably least adequate. And then also focusing on retention of the business that's so adequately priced. That's where the rubber is really meeting the road, and that segmentation is really helping to drive those results.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I'm going to try Mark's question from a slightly different perspective, if that's okay. Historically, Cincinnati has been a very methodical company. And I'm wondering now that you've got reinsurance and Lloyd's capabilities, is it reasonable to expect maybe faster reaction to take advantage of temporary opportunities like property cat seems to be this year?\nSteve Johnston: Yes, Meyer. That is an excellent point. And I think in both areas, I think particularly in Cincinnati Re, as they have been looking at these policies, both quantitatively and qualitatively on a one-by-one basis and are in a position to react quickly to these types of opportunities, and that was part of the strategic decision at the beginning.\nSteve Spray: Hey, Meyer. I might -- this is Steve Spray, I might add, too, just because it's a great question. I think it's a great point. As our E&S company, CSU, founded and we started back in '08, gives us that kind of flexibility for our agents as well. And I think we've learned a lot as that has continued to grow to the point now where we're issuing homeowner business on an E&S basis and able to provide our agents and the policyholders they have that flexibility and capacity and solutions. And I think the same thing is going to happen for our agents as we go forward and give them -- what I'll call or I think we would call just that much more effective access to Lloyd's. So everything we develop as a company is focused on that agency strategy. And so bringing the agents more flexibility, more capabilities is certainly in the plans today and moving forward.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's very helpful. Related question with regard to the agencies. One of the theories that's been banding around is that a lot of, let's say, regional or mutual companies don't necessarily have the capital seeing the property-related volatility that the reinsurance market is kind of forcing back to the primary carriers. And I was wondering, based on your conversations with agents, is that like a phenomenon that they're seeing? And is that underlie some of the growth expectations for '23?\nSteve Spray: I think it is probably a little early to tell what the 1/1 (ph) renewals and then 4/1 and 6/1, how that's going to impact quite frankly, any carriers. I'd tell you, insurance is -- for us, insurance is a local business there, and there's a lot of great regional mutual companies out there that we compete with on a day-to-day basis. It's something we do think about, but not hearing a lot of feedback yet. We've seen -- anecdotally, we've seen a couple of instances where the reinsurance, either the lack of or the costs have put pressure on some maybe a little more regional carriers, but I think it's too early to tell what the full impact will be. It's certainly something that -- it's a great question, something that we're keeping our eye on.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. And one last question, if I can. I was just looking for a little more color on the reserve development, specifically within excess and surplus lines.\nMichael Sewell: Yeah. Great, Meyer. This is Mike Sewell. And let me start off, we're really proud of our 34 years of -- consecutive years of net favorable development. So I'm going to open up with that. But related to E&S, were you thinking about on a year-to-date basis or on a quarter basis, are you looking?\nMeyer Shields: So mostly, I guess, on the -- I'm going to call it volatility in that's the right word, but the quarterly number seaman awful lot.\nMichael Sewell: On that, so for the E&S business, let's say, for the quarter, we saw a $4 million of reserve strengthening. But on a year-to-date basis, it was $9 million of favorable development. Thinking about it on the year-to-date basis, it was really favorable for all the accident years except the more recent accident year '21. And so we did see favorable development for 2020, 2019, 2019 and before. What I would say is, we follow a consistent approach. I wouldn't look at one quarter, two quarters as a as a trend. So you'll see some things move. But we've got the same actuarial professionals that are doing the work. They're looking at how the case reserves develop, the paid losses other factors. And so we really just follow the great work that our actuaries do. And I think it's a pretty consistent approach. So I wouldn't necessarily look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis and say that, that is some sort of a trend.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you so much.\nMichael Sewell: Thank you for the question.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Cole. Excellent job, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2023 call. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We see positive momentum in several areas and are bullish (ph) about our future prospects despite 2022 financial results that were somewhat below our expectations. Challenges during the year included elevated inflation and higher losses from natural catastrophe events for us and the property casualty industry, in addition to the market volatility affecting the valuation of investment portfolios. Our experience in managing adversity, coupled with the company's financial strength allows us to maintain a long-term view and supports our confidence as we execute our plans. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was just over $1 billion, that's 31% or $457 million less than last year's outstanding fourth quarter, largely due to $307 million less benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $202 million for the fourth quarter was down $118 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $66 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 94.9% fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 10.7 percentage points higher than the 84.2% for the fourth quarter of last year, which was amongst the best combined ratios we've ever recorded. We think longer-term comparisons are also important. On a current accident year basis, excluding catastrophe losses, our 90.2% combined ratio compares favorably with each of the five years prior to 2020 and was 1.5 percentage points better than the average for that period with each accident year measured as of the respective year-end. On a calendar year basis, our 2022 combined ratio experienced a larger negative impact from catastrophe losses than in 2021, as they increased 4.2 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 1.2 points for the year. Inflation also pressured our combined ratio throughout 2022, contributing to less favorable results for both the current accident year and for reserve development on prior accident years as we have increased reserves for estimated ultimate losses. We've responded with actions to improve underwriting selection and pricing, including premium rate increases and increased expectations by underwriters as they factor inflationary trends into areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure. We believe we can successfully balance prudent underwriting and business growth to improve results next year with a 2023 GAAP combined ratio in the low to mid-90% range. We also believe our 2023 property casualty premium growth rate can be 8% or more. We recognize that weather and significant changes in industry market conditions that influence insurance policy pricing trends or some of the variables that will affect the property casualty results we ultimately report. In recent quarters, we've noted that commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated. Although, still elevated in the fourth quarter, it was to a less degree than earlier in 2022. While recent profitability for our commercial umbrella business is not as strong as we previously estimated after strengthening reserves during 2020. The average combined ratio for the years 2018 through 2022 is still good, below 85% on a calendar year basis and below 90% on an accident year basis with development through year end 2022. Overall premium growth was very good and continues to incorporate pricing segmentation. Our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while also addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing. They do an excellent job serving Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies that are outstanding at producing business for us. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 10% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year 2022, that includes a 13% increase in fourth quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. In addition to exposures increases, our Commercial Lines Insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single digit percentage range, higher than the third quarter. Our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high-single digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were at the high end of the low-single digits with both auto and homeowner higher than in the third quarter. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates for our personal auto line of business will continue to rise. Based on our rate filings that have averaged low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10%. Policy retention rates improved from year end 2021 with our Commercial Lines segment moving higher in the upper 80% range. In our Personal Lines segment, rising to the low to mid-90% range. Moving on to highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. The Commercial Lines segment grew both fourth quarter and full year 2022 net written premiums 9%. Its combined ratio for both the quarter and full year 2022 was approximately 99%. That's above where we aim for and reflects elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses that were higher than a year ago. For our personal lines segment, net written premium grew 16% for the quarter and 15% for the full year 2022, as we continued our planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its full year combined ratio was approximately 99% and reflected elevated inflation effects and is likewise above our near-term profit target. We have confidence that our proven long-term strategy and near-term actions we have taken will blend to improve results for both commercial and personal lines. Our Excess and Surplus Line segment finished the year with a 90.4% combined ratio, a good result, combined with 2022 net written premium growing 18%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each had another year of healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew full year 2022 net written premiums by 27% with a combined ratio of 97.4%. Cincinnati Global had a 2022 combined ratio of 88.9% with net written premiums growing 23%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its good performance with full year 2022 net income of $66 million, up 50% from a year ago and term life insurance earned premiums grew by 5%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. Our strong capital supports retaining additional risk and managing cost of rising reinsurance ceded premiums. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2023 are fairly similar to 2022, other than premium rate increases that averaged approximately 13%. The primary objective of our property casualty treaty -- catastrophe treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is retaining a greater share of losses for layers of coverage than what was effect for 2022, while adding $92 million of coverage in a new layer between $900 million and $1.1 billion. In 2023, we'll retain all of the first $200 million of losses and the share of the next $900 million for a catastrophe event compared with 2022 when we retained the first $100 million and the share of the next $800 million. Should we experience a 2023 catastrophe event totaling $1.1 billion in losses, we'll retain $542 million compared with $499 million in 2022 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2023 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $130 million, approximately $16 million or 14% higher than the actual $114 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2022. Our investment department continued to perform quite well, and Mike will provide some details. Investments is another area where we like to keep an eye on longer-term trends. For example, for the five years ended with 2022, our equity portfolio, compound annual total shareholder return was 11.1%, 170 basis points better than the S&P 500 Index. I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed favorably to VCR 2.1% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year 2022. The contribution from valuation of our investment portfolio was mixed, 10.5% favorable for the quarter, but unfavorable by 19.4% for the year due to challenges for both the stock and bond markets. A positive VCR of 12.8% for the quarter improved our 2022 full year VCR to negative 14.6%. Although that's below our expectations for a typical year, the 11.2% annual average over the past five years is within our annual average target range of 10% to 13%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments about several other important points for evaluating our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. We faced a number of challenges in 2022 and still recorded an underwriting profit for our insurance business. That result bolsters our belief that we'll see future benefits from our efforts to continually refine pricing precision and segmentation and our efforts to expand our geographic footprint and produce -- and product offerings. When you consider our financial strength, our experienced service-oriented associates and our Premier Agency force, I'm confident we'll be able to continue delivering shareholder value far into the future. Our Board of Directors shares that confidence and expressed it by increasing our quarterly cash dividend 9% last month, setting the stage for a 63 year of rising dividend payments. So that's not just paying the dividend for 63 straight years. That sets the stage for increasing the dividend for a 63 consecutive year. We believe that's a record that can only be matched by seven other publicly traded U.S. companies. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Cole, please open the call for questions. Good morning, Paul. No worries. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Paul. This is Steve. And we do see the inflation. As we just mentioned, have had our reserves developed favorably now for 34 years. And as a part of that, we try to be very prospective as we look at how we set our reserves and our pricing and be very prudent about it. And we do think that we are in a position for our rates to keep pace and exceed inflation. And I think that comes from a combination of the pure net rates that our net rate increases I went over in my fixed part of the call here and also exposure increases that we're getting both in personal and commercial lines. I think the combination of the two, they're both kind of intertwined in terms of the overall premium that we're able to charge. And the exposure base does contemplate to a certain degree, the inflation and building costs and so forth. Thank you, Paul. Sure, Mike. This is Steve again. And I think what we really focus on is the loss ratio points. And what we've done really over a decade or more is to model all of our losses. And what we've been able to do is to push our accident year ex-cat down over a number of years. And that puts -- and then we also have grown our balance sheet significantly. And that puts us in a position, I think, that's enviable right now as reinsurance rates rise and that we can look at what we think we're getting in terms of price adequacy on our book, as well as protection of our balance sheet through our CAT program. And so while we don't give guidance on a cat loss ratio, I think that we do feel that we're in a good position in terms of the overall in managing both our accident year ex-cat showing 34 years of favorable reserve development and also managing our cat exposure across the company. You're right. Nothing has changed. The 95 to 100 is a longer-term target through all cycles in the low to mid-90s is what we're looking for in the shorter term for 2023. Yeah. No, good question, and I will clarify that a bit. So I wanted to make sure to kind of put things on an apples-to-apples comparison. So this year's program 2023 goes up to $1.1 billion. And so we have moved up a bit as our equity has grown, our GAAP equity has grown, our premium has grown, we feel we are in a position to move the program up a bit, but we wanted to buy more at the top end. So to put it kind of on an apples-to-apples basis, I used a hypothetical $1.1 billion loss for both years 2023 and 2022. And you're right on for the 2023 year, we would have $542 million of exposure. So that would include the $200 million up to the attachment point plus co-participations and that compares with $499 million for 2022 -- in the 2022 program. Per event. Right. We have reinstatement provisions in the contracts. Yes. I have it. And you know it's interesting. We don't necessarily target a given percentage, but our 2022 full year in our inception to date are really pretty close. And for property, both from 2022 and inception to date, it's a little over 30% of the premium. For casualty, it's right in that 55% range. And for specialty, it's a little over 15% for the year in a little bit lower than that for the year-to-date, probably about 13%. So across time, it's been very consistent in that 30 plus range for property 53-ish for casualty and 15% or so for -- they didn't quite add up. I better make it get to 100%, so more like 30%, 55% and 15% across time. No. I think it's a little early on the January 1's, but -- it's one nice thing as buyers of reinsurance, we're seeing the cost go up. It's almost like a little bit of a hedge in that we have Cincinnati Re, we've got very talented people there, very experienced people, and you see that shining through in a market like this. And they are benefiting from the firming rates and firming terms and conditions that you read about. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, Grace. Yeah. That's a good point. At 13% for this year, that's the highest percentage growth in net rent premium we've had it since Insurance since 2001. And so we do recognize that there could be a slowdown. We're not predicting that necessarily or giving guidance on it, but it's possible as you point out, we want to be disciplined in our underwriting. Profit always comes first with us. And so our guidance is for a little bit less than what it was this year, but we are still very optimistic across all of our business areas in terms of the growth that we're seeing, the relationship we have with our agents, the technology we have, the models that we have, we feel very bullish about growth, but we did temper back a little bit from where we are for the full year, just to be cognizant of the points that you bring up, even though I wouldn't say that we're predicting it for sure. Grace, I'm sure there is some of that volatility that you can see, but I also know there's a lot of hard work that's been going on in addressing property. And it predates our addressing and say umbrella, for example. And it's nice to see the hard work of our underwriters and really everybody throughout the company chipping in here in terms of underwriting, loss control, pricing. And I do think it's paying off. Thank you. Yeah. We haven't provided that any lower than at the company-wide level. And it's really because it's a big team effort. Every one of our operating areas is focused on profit improvement, and we're seeing it across the board from underwriting to claims to loss control in the pricing and underwriting part of it. We are reflecting on the property in the exposure, the increase in inflation. We are trying to reflect that. And we're also getting a pure net rate on top of that and really feel that with our accident year ex cat wood is and the underwriting that we're doing in terms of cat exposure and geographic diversification that we're in a good spot to hit the numbers that we gave in the comments. Yes, Meyer. That is an excellent point. And I think in both areas, I think particularly in Cincinnati Re, as they have been looking at these policies, both quantitatively and qualitatively on a one-by-one basis and are in a position to react quickly to these types of opportunities, and that was part of the strategic decision at the beginning. Thank you, Cole. Excellent job, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2023 call. Have a great day."

Investment income continued to grow at an outstanding pace, up 12% for the fourth quarter and 9% for full year 2022 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income rose 7% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during 2022 totaled $36 million. Bond interest income was up 11% in the fourth quarter. The pretax average yield of 4.16% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 17 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds continue to rise to 5.01% during full year 2022. We continue to emphasize investing in fixed maturity securities with net purchases during the year totaling $788 million. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2022 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was nearly $1.3 billion before tax effects, including an additional $230 million of unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of 2022, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $847 million. Cash flow, in addition to rising bond yields contributed to the 7% increase in interest income we reported for the year. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2022 generated almost $2.1 billion, a record high amount, up 4% from a year ago. For the fourth quarter of this year, it rose 36%. Turning to expense management. Our objective is to appropriately balance expense control with continuing to make strategic investments in our business. The full year 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year reflecting lower accruals for agency profit-sharing commissions. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and target net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. We have now had $34 million of net favorable development on prior accident years. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During 2022, our net increase in the property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $1.029 billion, a 15% increase from the net reserve balance at year end 2021. The IBNR portion of that reserve addition was $765 million a further indication of the quality of our balance sheet. For full year 2022, we experienced $159 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.3 percentage points. Of that $159 million in net favorable development, $25 million of the net unfavorable amount from our commercial casualty lines of business, including an unfavorable $41 million for commercial umbrella and a net favorable $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the full year 2022 included favorable $96 million for 2021, favorable $124 million for 2020, unfavorable $72 million for 2019 and a favorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019. Our approach to capital management also remains consistent, and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe we have plenty of flexibility and also believe that our financial strength is in great shape. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we repurchased just over 101,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.55. As in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the fourth quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.47. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.10. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.83. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value per share by $1.14. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $5.15. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $7 per share during the fourth quarter to $67.01 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Yeah. Great, Meyer. This is Mike Sewell. And let me start off, we're really proud of our 34 years of -- consecutive years of net favorable development. So I'm going to open up with that. But related to E&S, were you thinking about on a year-to-date basis or on a quarter basis, are you looking? On that, so for the E&S business, let's say, for the quarter, we saw a $4 million of reserve strengthening. But on a year-to-date basis, it was $9 million of favorable development. Thinking about it on the year-to-date basis, it was really favorable for all the accident years except the more recent accident year '21. And so we did see favorable development for 2020, 2019, 2019 and before. What I would say is, we follow a consistent approach. I wouldn't look at one quarter, two quarters as a as a trend. So you'll see some things move. But we've got the same actuarial professionals that are doing the work. They're looking at how the case reserves develop, the paid losses other factors. And so we really just follow the great work that our actuaries do. And I think it's a pretty consistent approach. So I wouldn't necessarily look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis and say that, that is some sort of a trend. Thank you for the question."

            "content": "Paul, this is Steve Soloria here. Just in terms of moving forward, the allocation will remain virtually the same. We've taken advantage of the increase in rates over the course of the year to our benefits. We'll continue to do so, but we'll try and maintain an even keel and stay disciplined in our allocation moving forward. In terms of last year, as mentioned previously, the aggregates or kind of blended rate for the year was about 5%. Comparing that year-over-year, a year ago, we were at about 3.5%. So we picked up about 150 basis points on purchases over the year. Looking forward, as the Fed begins to hopefully slow down the rate increases, we'll probably see a bit of a pullback in the purchase yield moving forward, but we think we've booked some pretty nice yields over the course of the year, which will benefit us for the next eight to 10 years. Mark, this is Steve Solaria. We did have a couple of unique factors over the course of the year. We did have two companies pay special dividends. LyondellBasell paid on early in the year, which was about $5 million. And then in December, CME usually pays a special dividend, but the dividend that they paid this year was well in excess of what we had expected. So those two special dividends really, really factored into the increase in dividend income year-over-year."

            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Yeah. Mike, Steve Spray. Great question. I really do think the driver is the elevated inflation effects that we're seeing. We look at -- as I've commented on the past, we look at every single large loss and just see if we can see any trends whatsoever, it still seems to be rather random in that umbrella excess line. Like we said last quarter, though, all hands on deck. The entire book needs rate. We are getting rate into the book to cover that inflation. But we underwrite every single risk on its own merits. And the vast, vast majority of the umbrella or excess policies we write. As a company, we write the underlying too. So we know the risk. We underwrite each risk, like I said, on its own merits, and we are looking at each risk, the pricing, the terms, conditions. We look at specific venues, specific fleets. So to determine how much capacity we want to put out there. So it's a -- and again, it's a risk by risk scenario that we do, but it needs -- the book needs of rate. I think it's -- again, Steve here, Mike. I think it's all of the above. I think it's exposure. I think it is rate. Steve alluded to, our retentions remain strong. You talked about our small business platform we call synergy that rollout is going extremely well. That's feedback from our agents, still pretty early in the game, but the rollout is going rapidly. We couldn't be happier with that. So we see a lot of good prospects there. Our E&S company continues to produce outstanding profitable results and strong growth. Personal lines, you see the growth there has been very, very strong as well, both on the high net worth and middle market. And I think we're confident and feel good that we're in a good position in personal lines and that we're a strong player, both middle market and now high net worth. High net worth is about 51% of our total premium. So the growth trajectory there has been extraordinary too. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, Mike, Steve Spray. And it kind of goes to your prior question, too, is those average for us, the as net rate change just doesn't tell the full story and the underwriters working with our agents in segmenting the book, the tools that they have in front of them to really focus on getting rate and terms, conditions on those policies, but we feel we are probably least adequate. And then also focusing on retention of the business that's so adequately priced. That's where the rubber is really meeting the road, and that segmentation is really helping to drive those results. Hey, Meyer. I might -- this is Steve Spray, I might add, too, just because it's a great question. I think it's a great point. As our E&S company, CSU, founded and we started back in '08, gives us that kind of flexibility for our agents as well. And I think we've learned a lot as that has continued to grow to the point now where we're issuing homeowner business on an E&S basis and able to provide our agents and the policyholders they have that flexibility and capacity and solutions. And I think the same thing is going to happen for our agents as we go forward and give them -- what I'll call or I think we would call just that much more effective access to Lloyd's. So everything we develop as a company is focused on that agency strategy. And so bringing the agents more flexibility, more capabilities is certainly in the plans today and moving forward. I think it is probably a little early to tell what the 1/1 (ph) renewals and then 4/1 and 6/1, how that's going to impact quite frankly, any carriers. I'd tell you, insurance is -- for us, insurance is a local business there, and there's a lot of great regional mutual companies out there that we compete with on a day-to-day basis. It's something we do think about, but not hearing a lot of feedback yet. We've seen -- anecdotally, we've seen a couple of instances where the reinsurance, either the lack of or the costs have put pressure on some maybe a little more regional carriers, but I think it's too early to tell what the full impact will be. It's certainly something that -- it's a great question, something that we're keeping our eye on."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel of Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; Senior Vice President of Investments, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. In addition to market volatility affecting the valuation of our investment portfolio, elevated inflation and natural catastrophe events affecting the industry also continued to pressure our property casualty insurance results. We remain well-positioned to improve performance through ongoing focus on successfully executing profitable growth strategies for our insurance operations similar to how we have managed past challenges. Our financial strength provides us the ability to maintain a long-term view, keeping a steady approach that can benefit all stakeholders. We reported a net loss of $418 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million for the third quarter of 2022 was down $95 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $19 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.9% third quarter property casualty combined ratio was 11.3 percentage points higher than the 92.6% for the third quarter of last year. Inflationary pressures led to higher estimated ultimate losses in rising loss ratios on a current accident year basis. While we experienced another quarter of favorable development on prior accident years, it was less favorable than a year ago. We continue to respond with underwriting selection and pricing actions in addition to prudent reserving for estimated ultimate losses. In addition to various premium rate increase filings with the states, underwriters have increased expectations to address current inflationary trends in areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies, and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure. Commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated in recent quarters, and it's challenging to determine relevant drivers given unusual business activity and general uncertainty as the pandemic waned. For example, the third quarter of 2022 included three very large claims with estimated losses averaging $9 million each, while elevated losses during the second quarter were driven more by a higher frequency of smaller claims. We continue to carefully underwrite commercial umbrella risks and respond promptly to adequately reserve for emerging loss patterns, which we expect will eventually lead to a return of profitability for our commercial umbrella business. Overall, premium growth was strong. It included average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies continued their outstanding production and our underwriters are focused on working to retain and grow profitable accounts, while addressing areas where they judge pricing is not adequate segmenting opportunities on a policy by policy basis. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 14% for the third quarter of 2022. That included a 12% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums including 11% each for our commercial lines and personal lines insurance segments. Higher renewal premiums included healthy increases for higher levels of insured exposures that are rising faster due to elevated inflation amounts. For example, our commercial property premium adjustments for rising costs of building materials so far this year are about double the level of last year. In addition to exposure increases, our commercial lines insurance segment continue to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, somewhat higher than the second quarter. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high-single-digit range, also higher than the second quarter. Personal lines average renewal price increases remained in the low-single-digit range with auto a little higher and homeowner a little lower than the second quarter. Personal auto insurance for the industry, including our book of business, generally needs higher premium rates to achieve profitability. Based on our rate filings that average low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full-year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10% The commercial line segment grew third quarter 2022 net written premium by 10% with the combined ratio of 99.0%, reflecting elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses 1.2 percentage points higher than a year ago. For our personal line segment net written premium grew 15%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter combined ratio of 104.5% also reflected elevated inflation effects, while the catastrophe loss ratio was 4.1 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. Our excess and surplus line segment had a 93.9% combined ratio and continued healthy growth with a third quarter 2022 net written premiums increase of 16%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each experienced significant catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ian that drove their underwriting loss for the quarter. We expect catastrophe losses of that magnitude from time to time. Our estimate as of September 30 was within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ian's magnitude based on our models. Results of modeled effects estimating probable maximum losses are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Cincinnati Re grew third quarter 2022 net written premiums by 51%, while Cincinnati Global grew 21%, each having what we believe are good prospects for future profitability. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to perform quite well along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums of 4% that produced third quarter 2022 net income of $21 million and nearly tripled operating income of a year ago. We continue to use the value creation ratio as our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 8.4% for the third quarter of 2022. Net income before investment gains or losses made a positive contribution, but was again offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter. Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other points we consider important regarding our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at a rate of 8% for the third quarter of 2022, compared with the third quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 8% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during the first nine months of 2022 totaled $47 million. Bond interest income grew 7% in the third quarter. The pre-tax average yield of 4.08% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 2 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds continue to rise reaching 5.39% during the third quarter of 2022. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases totaling $534 million during the first nine months of the year. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.2 billion before tax effects, including an additional $514 million of unrealized losses in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $3.5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $4.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of just under $1.1 billion. Cash flow continues to fuel growth of investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2022 generated $1.4 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Regarding expense management, we continue to apply what we see as the appropriate balance between expense control and strategic investments in our business. The third quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.3 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. In the first three quarters of 2022, our net addition to reserves was $814 million already exceeding the full-year amounts for both 2021 and 2020. We think that's a strong indication of the quality of our balance sheet. During the third quarter 2022, we experienced $43 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.4 percentage points. On an all lines basis by accident year net reserve development for the first nine months of 2022 was favorable and included $94 million for 2021, $95 million for 2020 that partially offset by unfavorable $46 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. While we've recently reported significant unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years for our commercial casualty lines of business, the net $25 million for the first nine months of 2022 included $41 million for the commercial umbrella and net favorable amount was $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. Moving on to briefly highlight our consistent approach to capital management, we again repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. Importantly, we continue to believe we have plenty of financial flexibility and also believe that our financial strength remained in excellent shape. During the third quarter of 2022 we repurchased just under 2.1 million shares at an average price per share of $98.50. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.12, life insurance operations increased book value $0.14. Investment income other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.42. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $2.58. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.46. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the third quarter to $60.01 per share. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks Mike. Our fundamentals are strong and we have an excellent book of business curated from our agencies' best accounts. We clearly communicated across the organization the steps we need to take to improve challenged areas of our business and our underwriters are focused and aligned to those goals. Our financial strength remains excellent and allows us to keep concentrating on our long-term strategies and objectives of remaining a steady insurance market and producing shareholder value far into the future. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Anthony, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. You may now go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to touch a little bit about, maybe additional color on the deterioration in the accident year perhaps in commercial but in also excess and surplus lines that's excluding the umbrella piece. Can you talk about certainly what's going on there from a, I guess, just a pure inflationary issue or is there something else in that -- in those pieces that we should know?\nSteve Spray: Hey, Paul, good morning. This is Steve Spray. Let me tackle the E&S piece first. And I'd say to you there, it's that book is about 90% casualty driven. It's got inherent variability in it. It's E&S casualty is a severity business and you're going to get it -- you're going to get noise from quarter-to-quarter. I think it's more meaningful to look at it over longer period and through nine months I think you can see that that book continues to perform well. The E&S Company is coming off of nine years in a row, of a 90 combined or better, and performing well through nine months, too. But I would say that similar to what we're seeing on the casualty side on the primary business, standard business, we are seeing inflation or inflationary pressures there and taking prudent reserves to recognize that also.\nPaul Newsome: And maybe on the regular commercial business, is there anything in there other than pure just general inflation?\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think its general inflation. I think its businesses getting back to normal post-COVID or post-pandemic. And I think a lot of what we're seeing in the casualty book, the inflationary pressure is primarily on that commercial umbrella line.\nPaul Newsome: And then I was hoping you could talk a little bit about cat exposure in general. It's been elevated the last couple of years. And I noticed there's a fair amount of cat exposure is coming through at least as it's reported in the Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. How do you think about sort of -- how should we think about the cat loss going forward? Is kind of on average, what we've seen in the last couple of years about right? And is that kind of the choice that Cincinnati has made? I think historically, the cat loss and claim is relatively low, but it seems like it's kind of moved from a kind of 4 to 7 to somewhere around 7 to 12. And how should we think about that prospectively?\nSteve Johnston: Paul, this is Steve Johnston. And I think we have a vibrant risk management process that we adhere to. We do modeling of all of the particular risks. I think we're in a very good position with our property in terms of cat-exposed pricing now. I think that they have already been -- the prices have already been going up. They will continue to go up. I think if we look at CGU, our Lloyd's Syndicate, they've been a top quartile underwriter over at Lloyd's in the last two years. Even with the cat, so far through nine months, their combined ratio is under 100, and we're seeing strong rate growth there. And at the same time, they are diversifying into lines of business outside of the property-related. I think similarly with Cincinnati Re, we've started that from scratch just several years ago. We've developed a very talented team that really looks to understand all of their risks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. And we are very bullish on the opportunity for rate that both will get as we move into the year-end renewals and into next year. So we feel good about our property in catastrophe-related exposures. I guess I would even throw in high net worth there. There's a little bit more exposure there. But we think with the type of underwriting that we do, the quality of the homes we're writing and the potential for higher rate at this point. We're very confident and bullish that we are going to get really strong rate increases in all those areas.\nPaul Newsome: I mean, that's -- that's great. I guess -- but my question really is sort of -- is this an underwriting choice that we've seen a couple of years of elevated cats because you're moving into more property and stuff that has more catastrophe events? Or is this just an anomaly for the last couple of years?\nSteve Johnston: Well, I think our actual cat losses over the last couple of years have really not been that outsized. We've been in a position where years ago before we went into more diversification of our book a year with a heavy cat loss like this could put us over 100%, and did, if you look back to 2011 in those type of years. And now with, I think a better spread of risk; we can take body blows like this. We're still under 100% year-to-date and feel that we are bullish about the fourth quarter towards taking our streak of sub-100 combined ratios to 11 consecutive years. And I think over those, that time period, we've outperformed the industry on a combined ratio basis by about 5 points, and we've been growing at about half again the rate, this is in total, which puts us in a good position to invest well. And as you've seen with the investment income as Mike described, pre-tax up 9% year-to-date. Amongst that, dividend increase is up 13%. The equity portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500, both on a year-to-date basis and on a five-year trailing that drives our cash flow. And if you would look at our cash flow over time, it really has increased. If we would go back to 2012, our cash flow from operations was $247 million. It's increased very steadily ever since then up to about $1.1 billion in the 2016, 2017 time period up to nearly $2 billion a year ago. As Mike mentioned, we're at $1.4 billion through nine months compared to $1.5 billion. Excuse me, so that's our strategy, Paul, is we're going to grow over the long pool, as Steve mentioned, we think above the industry rate. We're going to do it with a combined ratio that is better. We're going to provide overwhelming claim service. We're going to invest well, both with our fixed income and our equity portfolio. Generate a lot of cash that we can then return to shareholders as we've done with our dividends by increasing them some 62 years in a row. We're going to continue to have a strong balance sheet as our reserves have developed favorably, I think, 33 years in a row. That's just our basic strategy over time is to steadily execute our strategy, and we think it will deliver value for our shareholders for a long time to come.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mike Zaremski with BMO. You may now go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey guys, good morning. So I just piggybacking off the last question. So it sounds like from your answer, if we think about the outlook for Cincinnati Re into 2023. It feels like your appetite remains focused towards growth and the Cincinnati Re's results over the last couple of years or, I guess, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you're okay with those results and kind of no change in strategy there.\nSteve Johnston: I would say that we'll see, I would very much anticipate significant rate increases. I think one thing to keep in mind to tie on to my comments, only about one-third of the Cincinnati Re written premiums, which in total are about a little bit over $0.5 billion through nine months, about one-third are property, another half are casualty and the other one-sixth specialty. So we will look across the organization very -- with a lot of scrutiny as to where we allocate capital in the property area relative to the type of pricing that we think we get on a risk-adjusted basis for the contracts and policies that are offered to us. So I think with Cincinnati Re, they're running just over 100 -- I think 103, nine or so inception to-date. And given the toughness of the reinsurance market over that period of time, yes, I'm not disappointed with that. We've been able to build a great team without really any cost to the organization and are now well-positioned, I think, as these prices firm to opportunistically and on a risk-adjusted basis, take advantage of it.\nMike Zaremski: I guess just curious if Cincinnati Re gives you guys some diversification, but is the combined ratio target for Cincinnati Re meaningfully lower than the company-wide range?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. It's lower than the company range, yes.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Great. I guess, switching gears to commercial casualty, and I appreciate your honesty and comments about the activity this quarter was a little unusual as it was larger claims versus prior quarters, so some smaller claims. So I just -- it sounds like there's not going to be post-pandemic, hopefully, knock on wood, you're coughing it up to just a normalization and kind of funky trends over the last couple of years. So it just -- it sounds like you're not going to take any meaningful terms and conditions or kind of strategic actions to rethink kind of multi-year policies or anything? Just -- it sounds like kind of steady as she goes you're going to take some rates and nothing kind of beyond that to kind of take into account these unusual past couple of quarters or more?\nSteve Johnston: Well, great. We are going to take strong action. I think the one thing we want to point out is just to recognize that we do have inherent volatility in our umbrella book. For 2019, our paid losses for umbrella were up 80%. And then in 2018 -- 2018 and 2020, they were down 35%. So there's going to be some variability there. But we are all hands on deck and I think Steve Spray is best to describe the specifics of what we're going to do to address umbrella.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Thanks, Steve. Good morning again, Mike. Yes, I don't want you to leave thinking that we're not taking action on the umbrella book. Like Steve said, it's a sizable book for us. It's over $500 million. We've written umbrella very well for many, many years. We've got a lot of expertise on that front. We feel very good about the line. It's performed very well. Matter of fact, from 2017 through 2021, each year our umbrella excess book was sub-80 combined each year. Definitely have inflationary pressure. You can see it, as Steve said in his remarks and then in our Q and in our release as well, the book needs rate. It's getting rate not only from specific rate increases that we're providing to the umbrella, but you're also getting lift from the underlying exposure changes as well because umbrella is priced off of your underlying general liability and your underlying auto. So we're getting lift there. We analyze every single large loss we have and look at it from a standpoint, do we see any specific trends whether it be geography, class of business segment, agency field rep. Don't see any trends there. I would tell you that our commercial umbrella is typically driven by the underlying commercial auto, meaning those underlying commercial auto losses that will pierce up into the umbrella. So like Steve said, it's all hands on deck. Its risk selection, it's pricing. And it's also looking at where we lay out the capacity, different jurisdictions, whether it be individual state, or segment of the market. So something that we've done well for a long time. We think we can -- well, not think, I know we can return it to profitability. We've taken prudent reserving here with the uncertainty that we've experienced. But like Steve said, it's all hands on deck.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe a similar question, if I can sneak another one in, on personal lines. The data, I guess, we can look at, but the cognizant that you have more of a super-regional focus versus some of the national players that you've been taking a little less rate than many peers over the last year. It sounds like, clearly, you've stated the last couple of quarters you're going to start pushing the gas on taking rate in personal lines, especially in auto. But -- just curious, when you speak to your agents, do you expect an impact on your top-line growth? Or is it going to change kind of your strategy near-term? And just curious if you also feel like some of the business you've put on the books over the last year, just probably isn't that profitable, but you're playing the long game, especially in the high net worth space, so over time, you'll well exceed your cost of capital? Thanks.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Well great question, Mike. Make sure I can get all that in my answer. If I don't, please give me a follow-up. But our -- we're about 50:50 now, high net worth to middle market. Our middle market business has been under pressure for several years as we have taken -- we've had to take specific rate action. And quite frankly, in some specific states, we had to be pretty aggressive. And that put our middle market personal lines growth under pressure. It's still under pressure. But we think we've seen the bottom. New business for middle market is actually up through nine months this year in personal lines. The last three years on personal auto have performed very well. We're definitely seeing the inflation pressure this year. Hence, what Steve talked about as far as the rates that we're going to be planning on getting in 2023? High net worth is performing very well. The industry for high net worth over time has outperformed middle market personal lines. The last several years have been, I think a little difficult for the industry with cat. But I think we're at the right place at the right time with personal lines. And I think the fact that we're 50:50 is unique in the market. It's differentiating. Our agents appreciate it. And we're just getting more sophisticated and more segmented in our pricing as well. So I think the outlook for personal lines going forward is really, really good as well.\nMike Zaremski: You got everything in there. Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Okay. Thanks, Mike.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. You may now go ahead.\nSid Parameswar: Hey, good morning. This is actually Sid on for Greg. We've got a couple of questions on the reserve charges in commercial casualty and commercial auto. So hoping maybe you could unpack that for a minute and provide any additional information.\nMike Sewell: Sure. Yes. Let me -- this is Mike. Let me start and then if Steve or Steve or anyone would like to add any color. But -- for the quarter, we had favorable development of $43 million, which, as I indicated, was 2.4 points for the quarter. And I would note that for the last several years, we've been in the range of 2.5 to 5 points of favorable development. So the quarter is at the lower end of that range, but right there with the range. Unpacking it, as you described, every line had favorable development, except for the commercial casualty and then the auto for both commercial and personal. Related to the commercial casualty for the quarter that was unfavorable by $23 million, and of that number, $16 million related to commercial umbrella. And actually, for the quarter, it was -- there was some reserve strengthening for 2021 and 2020 accident year, but then the older accident years for commercial umbrella actually was favorable. That's a little bit of the opposite when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, a year-to-date basis we had $143 million of favorable development in total. Commercial casualty on a year-to-date basis was unfavorable by $25 million. When you unpack that, umbrella was unfavorable by $41 million, while all the other commercial casualty was favorable by $16 million. And then if you look at that, commercial casualty by accident year, it was favorable on a year-to-date basis for both 2021 and 2020 and then it was unfavorable for 2019 -- accident year 2019 and prior to that. I probably would also make the same comment if I think about commercial auto, personal auto, both on a year-to-date basis and a quarterly basis that was unfavorable for both of those time periods. But then when you look at the accident years, it was the unfavorable development was primarily in the 2019 and previous accident years. But it was favorable for accident year 2021 and 2020. Those are a lot of numbers I threw out and hopefully unpack that at least. But if there's any other questions or anyone else here would like to expand? Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets Insurance. You may now go ahead. Pardon me Scott, your line maybe muted.\nScott Heleniak: Good morning. I just wanted to touch base real quick on the commercial umbrella. You gave some good detail on that. And you mentioned that the -- so it was more of a severity issue this quarter as opposed to second quarter's frequency. Just wondering if you can talk about how much of the deviation between the frequency between second quarter and third quarter. And I'm assuming that the severity was that just litigation, adverse litigation that you saw on that book?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I don't have the exact frequency numbers. It was less frequency for the third quarter. I don't know that I would necessarily call it litigation as far as much as I would just say, we're getting some claims in, and we go to think about where we should set the reserve. It is just larger than -- these are larger claims than we had second quarter. It was -- we're just trying to give some color that it was more frequency-driven for commercial umbrella in the second quarter and more severity-driven in the third.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. Yes, that's fair enough. And then I just wanted to touch base real quick on the buybacks, you're pretty active again for the second consecutive quarter, a fair amount, a couple of hundred million. And so is this something that you might be a little more assertive or a little more regular on? Or is this -- I know you mentioned maintenance buyback. It seems like it's a little bit more than that, at least a couple -- the last couple of quarters, but if you could just give us your updated thoughts on where you were. It's certainly enough for the share count to be down year-over-year and to make a little bit of a difference, but anything you can offer there?\nMike Sewell: Sure. No -- this is Mike. I would say our thought process around that really has not changed. So I also call it a maintenance buyback. Yes, you are correct for the quarter and for the year, now we've repurchased about 3.6 million shares. That's higher than the maintenance but for the current year. But if you go back and look at the last several years, it has bounced around a little bit. Just a couple of years ago, we only purchased -- we purchased 600,000 shares. So it's kind of on average, I'll say that it will cover our maintenance. If you go back to when we have some larger buybacks back in about 2007/2008, our total share count is just slightly below where we were at that time. So -- it's -- we've kind of maintained a certain level. If it's down 1 million, 2 million, 3 million shares from that time period, that's probably not very significant, when you're -- when you've got 160 million shares outstanding. So I would still call it a maintenance buyback, but it's -- we'll look at it quarter-to-quarter and may be higher, may be lower.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. Makes sense. I just had one last one, too, on the expense ratio. You made the comment how a lot of it was just driven by the lower contingent commissions that were paid. But I know you mentioned a few quarters ago, but the target was to get the expense ratio down to 30%. And just wondering if you thought that might be realistic to happen in 2023 based on what you're seeing now?\nMike Sewell: Well, it's something that we continue to work on. So of course, we want -- our target is to be below a 30% expense ratio. But if we're not below a 30%, because we are paying more commissions, profit sharing to agencies, that's probably a good thing overall. So I'll still take that. But we would still like to have a goal of being profitable, paying a lot of commissions and being under a 30% would be a great way to do it. And so we'll still keep working on our expenses and trying to have the increase of expenses be slower than the increase in premiums.\nScott Heleniak: I agree on that, more than happy to pay the expense if you get the good business, but that's helpful. Thanks a lot.\nMike Sewell: You bet. Thank you for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may now go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Sorry. Good morning. I guess the question that I'm hearing a lot is if there are issues in umbrella, is there any concern that that is sort of the initial reflection of another wave of social inflation that will ultimately impact casualty lines because it sounds like you're still confident in user adequacy or redundancy elsewhere? And I was wondering how you're thinking about that.\nSteve Johnston: Meyer, it's a good question. I think that it is a reflection of really all types of inflation. I think that when you look at upper layers, there's a leveraged impact. And then as you go up in layers for a constant inflation rate, it has a higher impact on each layer as you go up, and I think it's generally because those claims that otherwise would have been just below the attachment point now inflate into the layer as well as the normal inflation on the layer. So I think it's something that we keep a close eye on, try to measure, try to price for, go through everything that Steve mentioned already in terms of all hands on deck from underwriting to pricing to claims to make sure that we are understanding the impacts on umbrella and also recognizing that there's volatility there, as I mentioned a little bit earlier in terms of what we've seen a variation of payments on commercial umbrella from one year to the next. There's just going to be some natural variation. But in this inflationary time period, it calls for a very much heightened sense of urgency and intensity from every area of our company.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That is helpful. I have, I think a mathematically similar question when we look at the large loss data combined losses over between $1 million and $5 million and $5 million and higher in commercial, about 50% year-over-year, much more than in the second quarter. Is there any way of getting a sense as to how much of that increase in larger losses is just a function of inflation pushing some losses over that line?\nSteve Johnston: That's part of our analysis, Meyer, and we'll be looking at that. Where we're seeing it, as Steve mentioned, in terms of geographic areas and the various limits that we write, which are generally relative, I think the most in the industry, smaller layers. But all that we need to take a look at it. It is difficult to ascertain or really specifically assign it to inflation given the inherent volatility we see in the book.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then one -- that is very helpful. I guess one final question. Does anything in third quarter results, I guess, on the cat side, lead you to want to change the structure of your reinsurance protection in 2023?\nSteve Spray: Meyer, this is Steve Spray. I would say, no, nothing that we saw in the third quarter, would lend us to change the structure. I think one of the good things with that is it's pretty common knowledge out there that you hear that at the new insurance market is going to harden. I think we believe we're in a really good position, relatively speaking for that. We're just in the middle of our property -- all of our reinsurance renewals now. But I think the good thing is we have performed well for our reinsurers over time. We take a long-term approach in partnership with them. And we've got the financial strength, the financial flexibility to -- if we need to take more co-participation and balance that with rate, we're in an enviable position, I think that we've got the financial strength to do that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Grace Carter with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nGrace Carter: I had a quick question on rate versus trend in commercial lines. I mean obviously, loss cost trends have kind of proceeded to be challenging this quarter, and you mentioned that your commercial pricing is somewhat higher versus 2Q 2022. So how do you see the spread between your pricing versus loss cost trends in 3Q 2022 versus earlier in the year? And I mean, is there any color that you all can give us on how that might evolve going forward, just given where inflation is trending and your continued pricing actions?\nSteve Johnston: Okay. Good question. And I think for the commercial lines segment, we are in a position, as we define loss costs versus premium that we can stay ahead of the trend. We are very prospective. We're looking out into the prospective policy periods in terms of estimating how loss causes -- loss costs will rise versus the type of premium that we think we're going to get. And we think for the sector, we should be in a position to be ahead of loss costs. Obviously, some of the lines of business are more challenging than others, but I think in total that we can get there. I think really, when you look at our ex cat accident year combined ratio of 91.1%, while that's a deterioration from where it was in 2021. That was an awfully tough comp, the best accident year ex cat that we've ever put in for the full-year, it was an accident year ex cat combined ratio of 86.2%. The current 91.1% that we have relative to our accident year ex cat for every year from 2012 through 2019 is actually better than every one of those except for 2016 where we were at 90.8% so just 3 basis points lower there. So I think given where we are, given the trends that we're estimating, recognizing the challenge and that needs to be met with not only rate but underwriting and again, every aspect of every part of the company coming together to do their part to manage the loss cost lower. We feel that we're in a good position for the sector as we go into 2023.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And then I had a quick question on the umbrella trends as well. I think last quarter; you all had mentioned that more gradual court reopening had driven a little bit of volatility in those losses. I was curious just as that kind of period of closures gets further behind us, if that continues to drive some issues this quarter or is that has gotten better.\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I think it's still uncertain. I would hope that it especially given our commentary on frequency in the umbrella line decreasing here into the third quarter that it's slowing down. But that is an uncertain area that I think ourselves and really the industry in general will be keeping an eye on.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Harry Fong with MKM Partners. You may now go ahead.\nHarry Fong: Thank you. Good morning, Steve, and Steve. I heard quite a bit about the umbrella line and the longer-term trend of development from 2017 through 2021. However, we did see, if I recall correctly, the bump in frequency in either the fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017 that led to a very similar discussion as what we've been hearing this morning. Can you characterize what you saw in large frequencies back then to what is going on today? And are there significant differences that may require you to implement changes that will take longer to improve the current situation?\nSteve Johnston: Yes, Harry, you are very astute in recognizing that. I think we have seen with the volatility in the line over time, ups and downs in terms of the performance. I would think one thing that was maybe a little bit different than now as we were seeing the paid-to-incurred ratio rising. Currently, that isn't the case. I think we're reserving more now than we were then relative to the exposure. So it's a slight difference. But to be honest, I think it's the same approach that we'll take that we did back then that worked out to be successful really in what I would consider to be not that long of a time period.\nHarry Fong: So claims from third parties hasn't risen yet. What drove the increase the reserves, just the macro environment rather than experience?\nSteve Johnston: I would say it's a little bit of both. I would say it's a little bit of both.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Anthony, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today to hear more about our third quarter results. In addition to market volatility affecting the valuation of our investment portfolio, elevated inflation and natural catastrophe events affecting the industry also continued to pressure our property casualty insurance results. We remain well-positioned to improve performance through ongoing focus on successfully executing profitable growth strategies for our insurance operations similar to how we have managed past challenges. Our financial strength provides us the ability to maintain a long-term view, keeping a steady approach that can benefit all stakeholders. We reported a net loss of $418 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million for the third quarter of 2022 was down $95 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $19 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.9% third quarter property casualty combined ratio was 11.3 percentage points higher than the 92.6% for the third quarter of last year. Inflationary pressures led to higher estimated ultimate losses in rising loss ratios on a current accident year basis. While we experienced another quarter of favorable development on prior accident years, it was less favorable than a year ago. We continue to respond with underwriting selection and pricing actions in addition to prudent reserving for estimated ultimate losses. In addition to various premium rate increase filings with the states, underwriters have increased expectations to address current inflationary trends in areas such as risk selection criteria, pricing of policies, and adjusting premium factors for changes in exposure. Commercial umbrella loss experience has been elevated in recent quarters, and it's challenging to determine relevant drivers given unusual business activity and general uncertainty as the pandemic waned. For example, the third quarter of 2022 included three very large claims with estimated losses averaging $9 million each, while elevated losses during the second quarter were driven more by a higher frequency of smaller claims. We continue to carefully underwrite commercial umbrella risks and respond promptly to adequately reserve for emerging loss patterns, which we expect will eventually lead to a return of profitability for our commercial umbrella business. Overall, premium growth was strong. It included average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Cincinnati Insurance appointed agencies continued their outstanding production and our underwriters are focused on working to retain and grow profitable accounts, while addressing areas where they judge pricing is not adequate segmenting opportunities on a policy by policy basis. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 14% for the third quarter of 2022. That included a 12% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums including 11% each for our commercial lines and personal lines insurance segments. Higher renewal premiums included healthy increases for higher levels of insured exposures that are rising faster due to elevated inflation amounts. For example, our commercial property premium adjustments for rising costs of building materials so far this year are about double the level of last year. In addition to exposure increases, our commercial lines insurance segment continue to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, somewhat higher than the second quarter. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high-single-digit range, also higher than the second quarter. Personal lines average renewal price increases remained in the low-single-digit range with auto a little higher and homeowner a little lower than the second quarter. Personal auto insurance for the industry, including our book of business, generally needs higher premium rates to achieve profitability. Based on our rate filings that average low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full-year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10% The commercial line segment grew third quarter 2022 net written premium by 10% with the combined ratio of 99.0%, reflecting elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses 1.2 percentage points higher than a year ago. For our personal line segment net written premium grew 15%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its third quarter combined ratio of 104.5% also reflected elevated inflation effects, while the catastrophe loss ratio was 4.1 percentage points lower than last year's third quarter. Our excess and surplus line segment had a 93.9% combined ratio and continued healthy growth with a third quarter 2022 net written premiums increase of 16%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each experienced significant catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ian that drove their underwriting loss for the quarter. We expect catastrophe losses of that magnitude from time to time. Our estimate as of September 30 was within our expectations of loss potential for events of Ian's magnitude based on our models. Results of modeled effects estimating probable maximum losses are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Cincinnati Re grew third quarter 2022 net written premiums by 51%, while Cincinnati Global grew 21%, each having what we believe are good prospects for future profitability. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to perform quite well along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums of 4% that produced third quarter 2022 net income of $21 million and nearly tripled operating income of a year ago. We continue to use the value creation ratio as our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 8.4% for the third quarter of 2022. Net income before investment gains or losses made a positive contribution, but was again offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter. Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other points we consider important regarding our financial performance. Thanks Mike. Our fundamentals are strong and we have an excellent book of business curated from our agencies' best accounts. We clearly communicated across the organization the steps we need to take to improve challenged areas of our business and our underwriters are focused and aligned to those goals. Our financial strength remains excellent and allows us to keep concentrating on our long-term strategies and objectives of remaining a steady insurance market and producing shareholder value far into the future. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Anthony, please open the call for questions. Paul, this is Steve Johnston. And I think we have a vibrant risk management process that we adhere to. We do modeling of all of the particular risks. I think we're in a very good position with our property in terms of cat-exposed pricing now. I think that they have already been -- the prices have already been going up. They will continue to go up. I think if we look at CGU, our Lloyd's Syndicate, they've been a top quartile underwriter over at Lloyd's in the last two years. Even with the cat, so far through nine months, their combined ratio is under 100, and we're seeing strong rate growth there. And at the same time, they are diversifying into lines of business outside of the property-related. I think similarly with Cincinnati Re, we've started that from scratch just several years ago. We've developed a very talented team that really looks to understand all of their risks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. And we are very bullish on the opportunity for rate that both will get as we move into the year-end renewals and into next year. So we feel good about our property in catastrophe-related exposures. I guess I would even throw in high net worth there. There's a little bit more exposure there. But we think with the type of underwriting that we do, the quality of the homes we're writing and the potential for higher rate at this point. We're very confident and bullish that we are going to get really strong rate increases in all those areas. Well, I think our actual cat losses over the last couple of years have really not been that outsized. We've been in a position where years ago before we went into more diversification of our book a year with a heavy cat loss like this could put us over 100%, and did, if you look back to 2011 in those type of years. And now with, I think a better spread of risk; we can take body blows like this. We're still under 100% year-to-date and feel that we are bullish about the fourth quarter towards taking our streak of sub-100 combined ratios to 11 consecutive years. And I think over those, that time period, we've outperformed the industry on a combined ratio basis by about 5 points, and we've been growing at about half again the rate, this is in total, which puts us in a good position to invest well. And as you've seen with the investment income as Mike described, pre-tax up 9% year-to-date. Amongst that, dividend increase is up 13%. The equity portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500, both on a year-to-date basis and on a five-year trailing that drives our cash flow. And if you would look at our cash flow over time, it really has increased. If we would go back to 2012, our cash flow from operations was $247 million. It's increased very steadily ever since then up to about $1.1 billion in the 2016, 2017 time period up to nearly $2 billion a year ago. As Mike mentioned, we're at $1.4 billion through nine months compared to $1.5 billion. Excuse me, so that's our strategy, Paul, is we're going to grow over the long pool, as Steve mentioned, we think above the industry rate. We're going to do it with a combined ratio that is better. We're going to provide overwhelming claim service. We're going to invest well, both with our fixed income and our equity portfolio. Generate a lot of cash that we can then return to shareholders as we've done with our dividends by increasing them some 62 years in a row. We're going to continue to have a strong balance sheet as our reserves have developed favorably, I think, 33 years in a row. That's just our basic strategy over time is to steadily execute our strategy, and we think it will deliver value for our shareholders for a long time to come. I would say that we'll see, I would very much anticipate significant rate increases. I think one thing to keep in mind to tie on to my comments, only about one-third of the Cincinnati Re written premiums, which in total are about a little bit over $0.5 billion through nine months, about one-third are property, another half are casualty and the other one-sixth specialty. So we will look across the organization very -- with a lot of scrutiny as to where we allocate capital in the property area relative to the type of pricing that we think we get on a risk-adjusted basis for the contracts and policies that are offered to us. So I think with Cincinnati Re, they're running just over 100 -- I think 103, nine or so inception to-date. And given the toughness of the reinsurance market over that period of time, yes, I'm not disappointed with that. We've been able to build a great team without really any cost to the organization and are now well-positioned, I think, as these prices firm to opportunistically and on a risk-adjusted basis, take advantage of it. Yes. It's lower than the company range, yes. Well, great. We are going to take strong action. I think the one thing we want to point out is just to recognize that we do have inherent volatility in our umbrella book. For 2019, our paid losses for umbrella were up 80%. And then in 2018 -- 2018 and 2020, they were down 35%. So there's going to be some variability there. But we are all hands on deck and I think Steve Spray is best to describe the specifics of what we're going to do to address umbrella. Thanks, Mike. Yes. I don't have the exact frequency numbers. It was less frequency for the third quarter. I don't know that I would necessarily call it litigation as far as much as I would just say, we're getting some claims in, and we go to think about where we should set the reserve. It is just larger than -- these are larger claims than we had second quarter. It was -- we're just trying to give some color that it was more frequency-driven for commercial umbrella in the second quarter and more severity-driven in the third. Meyer, it's a good question. I think that it is a reflection of really all types of inflation. I think that when you look at upper layers, there's a leveraged impact. And then as you go up in layers for a constant inflation rate, it has a higher impact on each layer as you go up, and I think it's generally because those claims that otherwise would have been just below the attachment point now inflate into the layer as well as the normal inflation on the layer. So I think it's something that we keep a close eye on, try to measure, try to price for, go through everything that Steve mentioned already in terms of all hands on deck from underwriting to pricing to claims to make sure that we are understanding the impacts on umbrella and also recognizing that there's volatility there, as I mentioned a little bit earlier in terms of what we've seen a variation of payments on commercial umbrella from one year to the next. There's just going to be some natural variation. But in this inflationary time period, it calls for a very much heightened sense of urgency and intensity from every area of our company. That's part of our analysis, Meyer, and we'll be looking at that. Where we're seeing it, as Steve mentioned, in terms of geographic areas and the various limits that we write, which are generally relative, I think the most in the industry, smaller layers. But all that we need to take a look at it. It is difficult to ascertain or really specifically assign it to inflation given the inherent volatility we see in the book. Okay. Good question. And I think for the commercial lines segment, we are in a position, as we define loss costs versus premium that we can stay ahead of the trend. We are very prospective. We're looking out into the prospective policy periods in terms of estimating how loss causes -- loss costs will rise versus the type of premium that we think we're going to get. And we think for the sector, we should be in a position to be ahead of loss costs. Obviously, some of the lines of business are more challenging than others, but I think in total that we can get there. I think really, when you look at our ex cat accident year combined ratio of 91.1%, while that's a deterioration from where it was in 2021. That was an awfully tough comp, the best accident year ex cat that we've ever put in for the full-year, it was an accident year ex cat combined ratio of 86.2%. The current 91.1% that we have relative to our accident year ex cat for every year from 2012 through 2019 is actually better than every one of those except for 2016 where we were at 90.8% so just 3 basis points lower there. So I think given where we are, given the trends that we're estimating, recognizing the challenge and that needs to be met with not only rate but underwriting and again, every aspect of every part of the company coming together to do their part to manage the loss cost lower. We feel that we're in a good position for the sector as we go into 2023. Yes. I think it's still uncertain. I would hope that it especially given our commentary on frequency in the umbrella line decreasing here into the third quarter that it's slowing down. But that is an uncertain area that I think ourselves and really the industry in general will be keeping an eye on. Yes, Harry, you are very astute in recognizing that. I think we have seen with the volatility in the line over time, ups and downs in terms of the performance. I would think one thing that was maybe a little bit different than now as we were seeing the paid-to-incurred ratio rising. Currently, that isn't the case. I think we're reserving more now than we were then relative to the exposure. So it's a slight difference. But to be honest, I think it's the same approach that we'll take that we did back then that worked out to be successful really in what I would consider to be not that long of a time period. I would say it's a little bit of both. I would say it's a little bit of both. Thank you, Anthony, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call."

            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Hey, Paul, good morning. This is Steve Spray. Let me tackle the E&S piece first. And I'd say to you there, it's that book is about 90% casualty driven. It's got inherent variability in it. It's E&S casualty is a severity business and you're going to get it -- you're going to get noise from quarter-to-quarter. I think it's more meaningful to look at it over longer period and through nine months I think you can see that that book continues to perform well. The E&S Company is coming off of nine years in a row, of a 90 combined or better, and performing well through nine months, too. But I would say that similar to what we're seeing on the casualty side on the primary business, standard business, we are seeing inflation or inflationary pressures there and taking prudent reserves to recognize that also. Yes. I think its general inflation. I think its businesses getting back to normal post-COVID or post-pandemic. And I think a lot of what we're seeing in the casualty book, the inflationary pressure is primarily on that commercial umbrella line. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Good morning again, Mike. Yes, I don't want you to leave thinking that we're not taking action on the umbrella book. Like Steve said, it's a sizable book for us. It's over $500 million. We've written umbrella very well for many, many years. We've got a lot of expertise on that front. We feel very good about the line. It's performed very well. Matter of fact, from 2017 through 2021, each year our umbrella excess book was sub-80 combined each year. Definitely have inflationary pressure. You can see it, as Steve said in his remarks and then in our Q and in our release as well, the book needs rate. It's getting rate not only from specific rate increases that we're providing to the umbrella, but you're also getting lift from the underlying exposure changes as well because umbrella is priced off of your underlying general liability and your underlying auto. So we're getting lift there. We analyze every single large loss we have and look at it from a standpoint, do we see any specific trends whether it be geography, class of business segment, agency field rep. Don't see any trends there. I would tell you that our commercial umbrella is typically driven by the underlying commercial auto, meaning those underlying commercial auto losses that will pierce up into the umbrella. So like Steve said, it's all hands on deck. Its risk selection, it's pricing. And it's also looking at where we lay out the capacity, different jurisdictions, whether it be individual state, or segment of the market. So something that we've done well for a long time. We think we can -- well, not think, I know we can return it to profitability. We've taken prudent reserving here with the uncertainty that we've experienced. But like Steve said, it's all hands on deck. Yes. Well great question, Mike. Make sure I can get all that in my answer. If I don't, please give me a follow-up. But our -- we're about 50:50 now, high net worth to middle market. Our middle market business has been under pressure for several years as we have taken -- we've had to take specific rate action. And quite frankly, in some specific states, we had to be pretty aggressive. And that put our middle market personal lines growth under pressure. It's still under pressure. But we think we've seen the bottom. New business for middle market is actually up through nine months this year in personal lines. The last three years on personal auto have performed very well. We're definitely seeing the inflation pressure this year. Hence, what Steve talked about as far as the rates that we're going to be planning on getting in 2023? High net worth is performing very well. The industry for high net worth over time has outperformed middle market personal lines. The last several years have been, I think a little difficult for the industry with cat. But I think we're at the right place at the right time with personal lines. And I think the fact that we're 50:50 is unique in the market. It's differentiating. Our agents appreciate it. And we're just getting more sophisticated and more segmented in our pricing as well. So I think the outlook for personal lines going forward is really, really good as well. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Meyer, this is Steve Spray. I would say, no, nothing that we saw in the third quarter, would lend us to change the structure. I think one of the good things with that is it's pretty common knowledge out there that you hear that at the new insurance market is going to harden. I think we believe we're in a really good position, relatively speaking for that. We're just in the middle of our property -- all of our reinsurance renewals now. But I think the good thing is we have performed well for our reinsurers over time. We take a long-term approach in partnership with them. And we've got the financial strength, the financial flexibility to -- if we need to take more co-participation and balance that with rate, we're in an enviable position, I think that we've got the financial strength to do that."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at a rate of 8% for the third quarter of 2022, compared with the third quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 8% for the quarter. Net equity securities purchased during the first nine months of 2022 totaled $47 million. Bond interest income grew 7% in the third quarter. The pre-tax average yield of 4.08% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 2 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds continue to rise reaching 5.39% during the third quarter of 2022. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases totaling $534 million during the first nine months of the year. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.2 billion before tax effects, including an additional $514 million of unrealized losses in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $3.5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $4.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of just under $1.1 billion. Cash flow continues to fuel growth of investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2022 generated $1.4 billion compared with $1.5 billion a year ago. Regarding expense management, we continue to apply what we see as the appropriate balance between expense control and strategic investments in our business. The third quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.3 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. In the first three quarters of 2022, our net addition to reserves was $814 million already exceeding the full-year amounts for both 2021 and 2020. We think that's a strong indication of the quality of our balance sheet. During the third quarter 2022, we experienced $43 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.4 percentage points. On an all lines basis by accident year net reserve development for the first nine months of 2022 was favorable and included $94 million for 2021, $95 million for 2020 that partially offset by unfavorable $46 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. While we've recently reported significant unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years for our commercial casualty lines of business, the net $25 million for the first nine months of 2022 included $41 million for the commercial umbrella and net favorable amount was $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. Moving on to briefly highlight our consistent approach to capital management, we again repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. Importantly, we continue to believe we have plenty of financial flexibility and also believe that our financial strength remained in excellent shape. During the third quarter of 2022 we repurchased just under 2.1 million shares at an average price per share of $98.50. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.12, life insurance operations increased book value $0.14. Investment income other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items added $0.42. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $2.58. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.46. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the third quarter to $60.01 per share. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Sure. Yes. Let me -- this is Mike. Let me start and then if Steve or Steve or anyone would like to add any color. But -- for the quarter, we had favorable development of $43 million, which, as I indicated, was 2.4 points for the quarter. And I would note that for the last several years, we've been in the range of 2.5 to 5 points of favorable development. So the quarter is at the lower end of that range, but right there with the range. Unpacking it, as you described, every line had favorable development, except for the commercial casualty and then the auto for both commercial and personal. Related to the commercial casualty for the quarter that was unfavorable by $23 million, and of that number, $16 million related to commercial umbrella. And actually, for the quarter, it was -- there was some reserve strengthening for 2021 and 2020 accident year, but then the older accident years for commercial umbrella actually was favorable. That's a little bit of the opposite when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, a year-to-date basis we had $143 million of favorable development in total. Commercial casualty on a year-to-date basis was unfavorable by $25 million. When you unpack that, umbrella was unfavorable by $41 million, while all the other commercial casualty was favorable by $16 million. And then if you look at that, commercial casualty by accident year, it was favorable on a year-to-date basis for both 2021 and 2020 and then it was unfavorable for 2019 -- accident year 2019 and prior to that. I probably would also make the same comment if I think about commercial auto, personal auto, both on a year-to-date basis and a quarterly basis that was unfavorable for both of those time periods. But then when you look at the accident years, it was the unfavorable development was primarily in the 2019 and previous accident years. But it was favorable for accident year 2021 and 2020. Those are a lot of numbers I threw out and hopefully unpack that at least. But if there's any other questions or anyone else here would like to expand? Thank you. Sure. No -- this is Mike. I would say our thought process around that really has not changed. So I also call it a maintenance buyback. Yes, you are correct for the quarter and for the year, now we've repurchased about 3.6 million shares. That's higher than the maintenance but for the current year. But if you go back and look at the last several years, it has bounced around a little bit. Just a couple of years ago, we only purchased -- we purchased 600,000 shares. So it's kind of on average, I'll say that it will cover our maintenance. If you go back to when we have some larger buybacks back in about 2007/2008, our total share count is just slightly below where we were at that time. So -- it's -- we've kind of maintained a certain level. If it's down 1 million, 2 million, 3 million shares from that time period, that's probably not very significant, when you're -- when you've got 160 million shares outstanding. So I would still call it a maintenance buyback, but it's -- we'll look at it quarter-to-quarter and may be higher, may be lower. Well, it's something that we continue to work on. So of course, we want -- our target is to be below a 30% expense ratio. But if we're not below a 30%, because we are paying more commissions, profit sharing to agencies, that's probably a good thing overall. So I'll still take that. But we would still like to have a goal of being profitable, paying a lot of commissions and being under a 30% would be a great way to do it. And so we'll still keep working on our expenses and trying to have the increase of expenses be slower than the increase in premiums. You bet. Thank you for the questions."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel : Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call.  Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteven Johnston : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Increased catastrophe losses and increasing inflation affecting the industry, pressured our property casualty insurance results for this quarter. We are well positioned to improve results through continued focus on pricing and risk selection as we have in the past, we'll follow our proven formula to successfully analyze and address challenged areas of our insurance operations. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are confident we can achieve profitable growth over the long term and through all economic cycles. We reported a net loss of $800million-- $808 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.  Non-GAAP operating income of $104 million for the second quarter of 2022 was down from last year's impressive $292 million, largely due to catastrophe losses that were $119 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.2% second quarter property casualty combined ratio was 17.7 percentage points higher than the 85.5% posted second quarter of last year. That increase reflected higher catastrophe losses and less favorable results on both the prior accident year and current year -- current accident year basis.  We regularly disclose large losses exceeding $1 million for individual property casualty claims, excluding losses from catastrophes. Commercial property and commercial umbrella tend to account for the bulk of those losses, each typically about 1/3 of total large losses. We noted on our last call that commercial property large losses rose sharply in the first quarter of this year. That increase reversed in the second quarter when they declined 86% from the second quarter of 2021.  For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, sorry. However, in the second quarter, commercial umbrella losses rose significantly, prompting reserve additions that we detailed in our 10-Q. That business has a long history of profitability for us and has benefited from very strong pricing in recent years for both the industry and us. Overall, premiums continued a healthy growth pattern with steady average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. We benefited from outstanding production from the finest independent agents, while our underwriters remain steadfast in seeking to retain and grow profitable accounts and address areas where they judge pricing is not adequate, segmenting opportunities on a policy-by-policy basis. Consolidated property casualty net written premium rose  for the second quarter of 2022. Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the first quarter. Our excess and surplus lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were slightly higher than in the first quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Personal auto is an area where we plan to more aggressively raise rates in future quarters as we work to improve its loss ratio. Underwriting processes, design to help premiums keep pace with rising property values, whether from outsized inflation or other changes in insured exposure amounts are another reason for significant increases in 2022 renewal written premiums. Our commercial lines segment grew second quarter renewal premiums by 10%, and our personal lines segment also grew second quarter renewal premiums by 10%. The commercial lines segment grew second quarter 2022 net written premiums by 10% with a combined ratio of 106.3, including higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its second quarter combined ratio up 112.1% also included higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. The second quarter provided another example of the benefits of improving diversification over time by product line and geography. Profitability was very good for our operations in excess and surplus lines insurance reinsurance, global specialty insurance and life insurance. Our excess and surplus line segment had an 85.1% combined ratio and continued strong growth with second quarter 2022 net written premiums growing 17%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each continued a pattern of profitable growth. Cincinnati Re, grew net written premiums by 31% for the second quarter of 2022, with a combined ratio in the low 80% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premium by 47%, with a combined ratio below 70%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income of $21 million and a 91% increase in operating income, along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums of 8%. We continue to emphasize the importance over time of the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 11.2% for the second quarter of 2022. Net income before investment gains or losses made a positive contribution, but was offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter.  Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will discuss a few more important insights regarding our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continues to grow and was up 11% for the second quarter of 2022 compared with the second quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 20% for the quarter, aided by a $5 million special dividend from one of our stock holdings. Net equity securities purchased during the first half of 2022 totaled $40 million. Bond interest income grew 6% in the second quarter. The pretax average yield of 4% for the fixed maturity portfolio was down 2 basis points from a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2022 was 4.75%. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases totaling $240 million during the first 6 months of the year. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate, for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.8 billion before tax effects, including a net decrease of $610 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.3 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $564 million. Cash flow continues to fuel growth of investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2022 generated $755 million compared with $917 million a year ago. As in the past, we emphasize careful management of expenses and balance that with strategic investments in our business. The second quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Moving on to loss reserves. We aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. In the first half of 2022, our net addition to reserves was $414 million, a pace well ahead of 2021 or 2020, and a level we believe is an indication of the quality of our balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2022, we experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2022 was favorable and included $61 million for 2021 and $54 million for 2020. That was partially offset by an unfavorable $15 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. Next, I'll comment briefly on capital management. We've had a consistent approach that includes share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. At the same time, changing circumstances or opportunities can influence us to repurchase more or less than historical averages. We continue to believe that we have plenty of financial flexibility and that our financial strength at the end of the quarter was excellent. Shareholder dividends continue to be our primary way of returning capital to shareholders and cash dividends declared in the first half of 2022 are up 10%. In addition, during the second quarter, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares at an average price per share of $124.44. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.26. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.13.  Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items headed $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.03. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $5.81, and we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $9.13 per share during the second quarter to $66.30 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteven Johnston : Thanks, Mike. While this wasn't the kind of quarter we want to have, one quarter doesn't sway us from our long-term strategies and objectives. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are optimistic about the future. In the last month, 3 different third-party organizations agreed. Moody's and S&P both affirmed our strong financial strength ratings. We were also again included on the Ward's 50 list. We are 1 of only 4 companies named 31x to the Property Casualty Awards 50, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to pause to recognize Marty Hollenbeck. Many of you know Marty from his years of Investor Travel. He's announced his intent to retire at the end of September after 35 years of service to our organization. We thank him for his steady hand overseeing investments, especially during some of the very challenging times of market volatility. As I'm sure you can all imagine, we're sad to see Marty go. At the same time, however, I have absolute confidence in Steve Soloria and his ability to smoothly step in to lead our investment operation with his nearly 30 years of experience. I know you all will feel the same as you get to know him during future investor visits. As a reminder, with Marty, Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, then Theresa Hoffer. MJ, please open the call for questions.\nOperator:  Our first question today comes from Derek Han of KBW.\nDerek Han : So my first question is 2 parts related to the commercial umbrella line of business. You readjusted your loss picks last quarter, but just curious what kind of new information that you've gotten to make another adjustment this quarter? And then secondly, since the umbrella line of business is pretty heavily exposed to inflation, how comfortable do you feel about the inflation assumptions embedded within your reserving and accident year loss picks.\nSteve Spray: Derek, Steve Spray here. Thanks for the question. Yes, we -- here in the second quarter, we've definitely seen inflationary impacts as well as pandemic effects on the umbrella book. As an example, courts closed during the pandemic, slower to open. We're seeing that show up. I would also say that our umbrella book in general, just -- from quarter-to-quarter is going to have inherent variability. And -- we've seen that here in the second quarter. Maybe for note as well, is that book, our commercial umbrella book is up over $500 million now. And we've got a long track record of underwriting profit, understanding how to price that book, the limits profile on it is relatively lower. The book reflects our primary business, which is -- tends to be smaller to midsized accounts. That's the business that we're primarily writing the umbrella coverage is over. So there's uncertainty for sure. There's inherent variability. You're seeing that in the actual results. And then on top of that, as you can expect from Cincinnati, and our long track record of recognizing uncertainty. We've gone ahead and recognized that through the IBNR for the reserving of the umbrella going forward to.\nDerek Han : Okay. That's really helpful. And then my second question is around the personal lines segment. You had really good growth in that segment, especially within the high net worth business. You've talked about in the past about how the high net worth business has a longer-term attractiveness relative to the middle market business. I'm just curious how you think about the overall profitability in the near term just in the context of rising loss trends?\nSteve Spray: Yes. Derek, again, Steve Spray. Yes, we are feeling really good about the high net worth business primarily the team that we've assembled, the expertise, the experience that they have. And you're right. The majority of our growth in personal lines right now is coming from high net worth. On the written premium side, it's almost all coming from high net worth. On new business, we have seen our middle market book rebound, although again, the new business lion's share is still coming from the high net worth. High net worth is important to us. We think we have a valuable contract. We think the way we handle claims is worth more premium. But that being said, I wouldn't want anybody to think that we are not completely focused on that middle market book as well. We think that we are in a unique position that we have the sophisticated pricing. We have the products. We have the team. We have the historical experience long term on the middle market book as well. So we feel good about the middle market book. Maybe to get a little deeper for you there. Personal auto, obviously is under pressure. A lot of that is coming from inflation. We are taking rate. And we've been taking rate in 2022. We'll continue to take rate in that personal auto book in 2022. And we expect in 2023 that we're going to take a little bit -- a little more than double the rate in the personal auto book that we are this year. The homeowner book is performing better, but it's under a little bit of pressure as well. We're taking rate in '22. We plan to continue to take rate in 2023. And the other thing I would add there is in homeowner line, we are getting high single-digit exposure change there, too. So that's helping with the inflationary pressure that we're feeling.\nDerek Han : Got it. I appreciate the color on that. And then last, just a numbers question. Did you see any Russia-Ukraine related loss this quarter?\nSteven Johnston : This is Steve Johnston. And yes, we did. For the quarter, we -- and this would come from our Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global areas for the quarter, $6 million and for the year-to-date, $11 million. So we think we have that properly managed.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle of RBC.\nMark Dwelle : I have a few questions. Starting with the commercial lines, when you had -- you reported a 64.8 accident year loss ratio before cat losses, that was up 7 points. Is all of that second quarter? Or is there a catch-up within that to catch up for first quarter loss trend?\nSteven Johnston : Mark, this is Steve Johnston, and that would be our first quarter pick -- I'm sorry, second quarter pick. That would be just the quarter's pick.\nMark Dwelle : So the relatively lower loss pick that you had for the first quarter. You've picked a -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand, based on the run rate you're seeing right now, you would like your loss pick to be roughly 65 points as compared to the relatively lower pick that you had in the first quarter?\nSteven Johnston : We just -- for each quarter, we try to do our best estimate of our reserves of our losses and premiums for each of the quarter. So the two stand on their own and of course, the year-to-date would be the sum of the two.\nMark Dwelle : Okay. Understood. And I presume the same applies related to the personal lines, the 8-point bump there that in accident year loss pick. That's all just on -- there's no prior quarter development embedded within that number.\nMike Sewell: That's correct.\nMark Dwelle : Okay. When you think about your loss cost trends right now, and I appreciate they vary by line of business. But if you were thinking about the loss -- your average loss cost trend across the entire commercial lines book, for example. What would you say that, that is right now based upon what you're seeing in your data?\nSteven Johnston : Well, you're right, Mark, that it is done at a very detailed level. And when we look at our prospects, we do it prospectively. We try to estimate what we think we need to trend losses for into the prospective rating period for the policies that will be effective. We do think, and as Steve kind of alluded to, that we are in a position that we can keep up with and/or exceed those loss cost trends as we go forward.\nMark Dwelle : I mean can you share sort of a run rate number? I mean some companies have said 5, some of it 6, 6.5. I mean is there a number you can share in terms of what you're seeing as far as trend?\nSteven Johnston : We don't have a specific number like that in terms of a number, but when we do talk about getting mid-single-digit rate. And as Steve alluded to, for both personal and commercial, some inflationary effects on our exposure growth, we feel that we can keep pace with and exceed that trend.\nMark Dwelle : Okay. Turning over to the personal lines. I mean, again, you commented that you're getting kind of low single-digit rates across the personal line book. Can you break that between what portion -- what you're seeing in the auto book as compared to the homeowners book?\nSteven Johnston : Yes. This is Steve again. For the auto, it would be currently in the low single digit and for the homeowners in the mid-single digit. And again, as Steve mentioned, for the homeowners, there is exposure growth and the rate for inflation in addition to the rate that we quote -- rate increase that we quote.\nMark Dwelle : As far as raising the rates on the auto book more aggressively, are you largely locked in on those rates now for this year based on your state filings or will you have to kind of begin that process from the start in order to try to get more. I ask because I mean your average rate increase in your auto book seems to be distinctly below where I would see at least some of your competitors at?\nSteven Johnston : It's a rolling process. So we're already engaged in some of the 2023 rate increases and then also a point we make is through the pandemic, we did not reduce our rates any through there at all. We did have a kind of a stay-at-home discount that was in place on the expense side for several weeks, but did not take rate decreases.\nMark Dwelle : But there's not much you can really do to improve the rate picture for 2022. It's -- you're pretty much just beginning the process of trying to tackle on '23. Is that what I'm hearing?\nSteven Johnston : Well, it's ongoing. It's rolling. So they've already been filed. But to your point, and we both kind of understand the earnings diagram for 2022 in terms of how rate will be earned during 2022. The ones that are in process, don't move the needle much.\nMark Dwelle : Right. Okay. One other question related to the investment portfolio. I guess I was a little surprised that the average pretax yield was effectively unchanged in the quarter. Would have flight if for no other reason than just getting better interest rates on your shorter-term money that, that would have pushed a little bit higher. But -- can you talk about maybe some of the dynamics there? When we might see that move a little bit higher?\nMartin Hollenbeck: Yes, Mark, this is Marty. I think you'll start to see it soon. that's what you look there is actually a realized yield. Our book value ended the quarter 4 basis points higher than Q1, although still 5 basis points less than a year ago in the second quarter. So we kind of had a little bit of a muted effect in the first quarter of the run-up in rates, it was sort of backloaded. So we didn't quite get the benefit with a little bit longer duration than typical. I didn't quite see it. But we saw definitely a significant rise in Q2, I think book yield purchased for the taxable was just under 5. Tax exempt was about 4. So it should start being more pronounced going forward here in the next couple of quarters.\nMark Dwelle : I see. Okay. So you are getting somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points of incremental new mine made relative to kind of where the realized book rate is right now. Is that about right?\nMike Sewell: Yes, about -- probably about 3/4, 70 to 75 basis points.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome : I wanted to hone in a little bit on the large losses again. Is there any way to kind of think about that increase from a sort of inflationary perspective versus not anything that would be noninflationary frequency level maybe just sort of something that's up for the quarter as we look at sort of that impact and think about it on a prospective basis, both for the personal lines business as well as for the commercial lines business, where I think they look kind of both large losses in general --\nSteve Spray: Yes. Paul, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Steve Spray, again. I would say, again, that umbrella book, there's inherent variability in it. And statistically, the number of losses that are there is just -- it's a really -- it's a really low number from quarter-to-quarter. So even if it jumps it's a smaller number. I would say, other than inflationary factor, which is certainly -- or inflationary factors certainly paying -- playing a role in that was what I mentioned earlier was just the courts reopening coming out of the pandemic. We've noticed that, that has -- that's impacted the quarter. And I don't know if Steve wants to add anything to that or not?\nSteven Johnston : That's hard to improve upon. I guess if I would think of any other comment would be umbrella it attaches at a higher layer. And so there is a leveraged impact of inflation. So what I mean by that is if historically, a claim is just below the retention, now if inflation is heating up, it would inflate into the layer. And so you have a leveraged effect on the upper layers like an umbrella policy, which would add to the claim count.\nSteve Spray: Paul, again, Steve Spray. I might just add a couple of things there for you is it's not uncommon that auto losses, both personal and commercial are what get up into that umbrella layer, those umbrella layers, and we saw that in the second quarter. So it's larger auto claims that have gotten up in there. We look at every single one of these claims, as I mentioned in the first quarter. And as far as geography or class of business, industry segment, we're not -- there's randomness there, and we're not seeing any patterns. So I thought I might add that for you, too.\nPaul Newsome : That's great. Just to clarify, and I apologize I can be is low. Are these -- the umbrella is this is both commercialized and personal lines or just commercial lines? And I guess your comments on the auto is that also both commercial lines and personal lines. Are auto creeping up into umbrella on both sides of the business or just the commercial side?\nSteve Spray: Well, yes, so we write commercial umbrella over commercial business, obviously, and personal umbrellas over personal. In personal lines, it is always -- it's almost always predominantly auto claims that get into your umbrella policies there. On the commercial side, it varies between, say, general liability claims that can balance up into the umbrella or commercial auto. I would say that we've seen just a slight uptick in the commercial auto getting into the umbrella.\nPaul Newsome : So the umbrella cases are on the commercial line or not. So just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the auto was elevated to -- personal auto was elevated too, but that the commercial umbrella is not necessarily related to just the auto on the commercial line side?\nA \u00e2\u0080\u0093Steven Johnston : That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correct.\nOperator: Seeing no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.\nSteven Johnston : Thank you, MJ, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steven Johnston",
            "content": "Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our second quarter results. Increased catastrophe losses and increasing inflation affecting the industry, pressured our property casualty insurance results for this quarter. We are well positioned to improve results through continued focus on pricing and risk selection as we have in the past, we'll follow our proven formula to successfully analyze and address challenged areas of our insurance operations. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are confident we can achieve profitable growth over the long term and through all economic cycles. We reported a net loss of $800million-- $808 million for the quarter due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.  Non-GAAP operating income of $104 million for the second quarter of 2022 was down from last year's impressive $292 million, largely due to catastrophe losses that were $119 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 103.2% second quarter property casualty combined ratio was 17.7 percentage points higher than the 85.5% posted second quarter of last year. That increase reflected higher catastrophe losses and less favorable results on both the prior accident year and current year -- current accident year basis.  We regularly disclose large losses exceeding $1 million for individual property casualty claims, excluding losses from catastrophes. Commercial property and commercial umbrella tend to account for the bulk of those losses, each typically about 1/3 of total large losses. We noted on our last call that commercial property large losses rose sharply in the first quarter of this year. That increase reversed in the second quarter when they declined 86% from the second quarter of 2021.  For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, sorry. However, in the second quarter, commercial umbrella losses rose significantly, prompting reserve additions that we detailed in our 10-Q. That business has a long history of profitability for us and has benefited from very strong pricing in recent years for both the industry and us. Overall, premiums continued a healthy growth pattern with steady average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. We benefited from outstanding production from the finest independent agents, while our underwriters remain steadfast in seeking to retain and grow profitable accounts and address areas where they judge pricing is not adequate, segmenting opportunities on a policy-by-policy basis. Consolidated property casualty net written premium rose  for the second quarter of 2022. Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the first quarter. Our excess and surplus lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal lines average renewal price increases were slightly higher than in the first quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Personal auto is an area where we plan to more aggressively raise rates in future quarters as we work to improve its loss ratio. Underwriting processes, design to help premiums keep pace with rising property values, whether from outsized inflation or other changes in insured exposure amounts are another reason for significant increases in 2022 renewal written premiums. Our commercial lines segment grew second quarter renewal premiums by 10%, and our personal lines segment also grew second quarter renewal premiums by 10%. The commercial lines segment grew second quarter 2022 net written premiums by 10% with a combined ratio of 106.3, including higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. For our personal lines segment, net written premiums grew 16%, mostly from our continued planned expansion of high net worth business produced by our agencies. Its second quarter combined ratio up 112.1% also included higher-than-usual catastrophe losses and elevated inflation effects. The second quarter provided another example of the benefits of improving diversification over time by product line and geography. Profitability was very good for our operations in excess and surplus lines insurance reinsurance, global specialty insurance and life insurance. Our excess and surplus line segment had an 85.1% combined ratio and continued strong growth with second quarter 2022 net written premiums growing 17%. Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global each continued a pattern of profitable growth. Cincinnati Re, grew net written premiums by 31% for the second quarter of 2022, with a combined ratio in the low 80% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premium by 47%, with a combined ratio below 70%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income of $21 million and a 91% increase in operating income, along with growth in term life insurance earned premiums of 8%. We continue to emphasize the importance over time of the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 11.2% for the second quarter of 2022. Net income before investment gains or losses made a positive contribution, but was offset by lower investment valuations during the quarter.  Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will discuss a few more important insights regarding our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. While this wasn't the kind of quarter we want to have, one quarter doesn't sway us from our long-term strategies and objectives. Our financial strength remains excellent, and we are optimistic about the future. In the last month, 3 different third-party organizations agreed. Moody's and S&P both affirmed our strong financial strength ratings. We were also again included on the Ward's 50 list. We are 1 of only 4 companies named 31x to the Property Casualty Awards 50, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to pause to recognize Marty Hollenbeck. Many of you know Marty from his years of Investor Travel. He's announced his intent to retire at the end of September after 35 years of service to our organization. We thank him for his steady hand overseeing investments, especially during some of the very challenging times of market volatility. As I'm sure you can all imagine, we're sad to see Marty go. At the same time, however, I have absolute confidence in Steve Soloria and his ability to smoothly step in to lead our investment operation with his nearly 30 years of experience. I know you all will feel the same as you get to know him during future investor visits. As a reminder, with Marty, Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, then Theresa Hoffer. MJ, please open the call for questions. This is Steve Johnston. And yes, we did. For the quarter, we -- and this would come from our Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global areas for the quarter, $6 million and for the year-to-date, $11 million. So we think we have that properly managed. Mark, this is Steve Johnston, and that would be our first quarter pick -- I'm sorry, second quarter pick. That would be just the quarter's pick. We just -- for each quarter, we try to do our best estimate of our reserves of our losses and premiums for each of the quarter. So the two stand on their own and of course, the year-to-date would be the sum of the two. Well, you're right, Mark, that it is done at a very detailed level. And when we look at our prospects, we do it prospectively. We try to estimate what we think we need to trend losses for into the prospective rating period for the policies that will be effective. We do think, and as Steve kind of alluded to, that we are in a position that we can keep up with and/or exceed those loss cost trends as we go forward. We don't have a specific number like that in terms of a number, but when we do talk about getting mid-single-digit rate. And as Steve alluded to, for both personal and commercial, some inflationary effects on our exposure growth, we feel that we can keep pace with and exceed that trend. Yes. This is Steve again. For the auto, it would be currently in the low single digit and for the homeowners in the mid-single digit. And again, as Steve mentioned, for the homeowners, there is exposure growth and the rate for inflation in addition to the rate that we quote -- rate increase that we quote. It's a rolling process. So we're already engaged in some of the 2023 rate increases and then also a point we make is through the pandemic, we did not reduce our rates any through there at all. We did have a kind of a stay-at-home discount that was in place on the expense side for several weeks, but did not take rate decreases. Well, it's ongoing. It's rolling. So they've already been filed. But to your point, and we both kind of understand the earnings diagram for 2022 in terms of how rate will be earned during 2022. The ones that are in process, don't move the needle much. That's hard to improve upon. I guess if I would think of any other comment would be umbrella it attaches at a higher layer. And so there is a leveraged impact of inflation. So what I mean by that is if historically, a claim is just below the retention, now if inflation is heating up, it would inflate into the layer. And so you have a leveraged effect on the upper layers like an umbrella policy, which would add to the claim count. Thank you, MJ, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continues to grow and was up 11% for the second quarter of 2022 compared with the second quarter of last year. Dividend income rose 20% for the quarter, aided by a $5 million special dividend from one of our stock holdings. Net equity securities purchased during the first half of 2022 totaled $40 million. Bond interest income grew 6% in the second quarter. The pretax average yield of 4% for the fixed maturity portfolio was down 2 basis points from a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2022 was 4.75%. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases totaling $240 million during the first 6 months of the year. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate, for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net decrease was approximately $1.8 billion before tax effects, including a net decrease of $610 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.3 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $564 million. Cash flow continues to fuel growth of investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2022 generated $755 million compared with $917 million a year ago. As in the past, we emphasize careful management of expenses and balance that with strategic investments in our business. The second quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from lower accruals for profit sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Moving on to loss reserves. We aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. In the first half of 2022, our net addition to reserves was $414 million, a pace well ahead of 2021 or 2020, and a level we believe is an indication of the quality of our balance sheet. During the second quarter of 2022, we experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2022 was favorable and included $61 million for 2021 and $54 million for 2020. That was partially offset by an unfavorable $15 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. Next, I'll comment briefly on capital management. We've had a consistent approach that includes share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. At the same time, changing circumstances or opportunities can influence us to repurchase more or less than historical averages. We continue to believe that we have plenty of financial flexibility and that our financial strength at the end of the quarter was excellent. Shareholder dividends continue to be our primary way of returning capital to shareholders and cash dividends declared in the first half of 2022 are up 10%. In addition, during the second quarter, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares at an average price per share of $124.44. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.26. Life insurance operations increased book value by $0.13.  Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items headed $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.03. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $5.81, and we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $9.13 per share during the second quarter to $66.30 per share. And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. That's correct. Yes, about -- probably about 3/4, 70 to 75 basis points."

I'll now turn the call over to your host, Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Sir, you may now begin.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call.  Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions.  At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Chief Investment Officer, Marty Hollenbeck; and Cincinnati Insurance's President, Steve Spray; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer.  First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP.  Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. It was another quarter of good operating performance. Our agency-focused strategy led to profitable growth and reflects well on the skill and dedication of our associates and excellent relationships with terrific independent agents. We reported a net loss of $273 million for the quarter, due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.  Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2022 was up $31 million or 14% versus a year ago. Our 89.9% first quarter property casualty combined ratio was 1.3 percentage points better than last year's first quarter. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects rose slightly compared with accident year 2021 measured at 3 months, reflecting an increase in large losses for our property lines of business.  We again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention with meaningful average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines improved from a year ago to the upper 80% range. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 12% for the first quarter of 2022. Our pricing segmentation efforts continue to support what we believe is profitable growth as our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing. We also believe renewal pricing during the first quarter was again ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment.  Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, personal lines average renewal price increases slowed by a small amount compared to the fourth quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.  Our commercial lines segment grew first quarter 2022 net written premiums by 8% and with a combined ratio of 92.3%. Our personal lines segment net written premium grew 11%, reflecting our continued planned expansion of high-net worth business produced by our agencies. The segment's first quarter combined ratio of 83.9%, improved 17.2 percentage points from a year ago, driven by lower catastrophe losses. Our excess and surplus lines segment had an 85.9% combined ratio and continued strong growth, with first quarter 2022 net written premiums rising by 25%.  Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had a nice quarter with healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 30% for the first quarter of 2022 with a combined ratio in the mid-90% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premiums by 24%, with a combined ratio also in the mid-90% range.  Our life insurance subsidiary generated first quarter 2022 net income of $10 million, matching last year's first quarter, and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 6%.  I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 6.9% for the quarter, while net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.9 percentage points. Lower investment valuations during the quarter resulted in the investment gains or losses component contributing negative 8.6 points.  Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other important aspects of our financial performance.\nMichael Sewell: Thank, you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income again grew at a good pace, up 6% for the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period a year ago. First quarter dividend income was up 12% and net equity securities purchase totaled $34 million. Bond interest income grew 4% in the first quarter while the pretax average yield of 4.01% for the quarter was down 13 basis points from a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2022 was 3.64%. We again purchased additional fixed maturity securities with net purchases during the quarter totaling $109 million.  Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2022 were unfavorable in aggregate for both our stockholdings and our bond holdings.  dollars before tax effects, including a net decrease of $746 million for unrealized gains in our bond portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.6 billion, including $46 million for our bond portfolio.  Cash flow again helped to grow investment income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter 2022 generated at $198 million compared to $354 million a year ago.  Balancing strategic investments in our business with expense containment initiatives continues to be a priority. The first quarter 2022 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 2.2 percentage points higher than last year. Most of the increase was from higher accruals for profit-sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses.  Regarding loss reserves, we aim for a consistent approach by targeting net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we considered new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the first quarter of 2022, we experienced $41 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years have benefited the combined ratio by 2.5 percentage points.  In recent years, we've experienced significant growth in commercial umbrella coverage within our commercial casualty lines of business, including 16% in 2021 as industry pricing for umbrella has been strong. Umbrella losses tend to be frequently -- relatively infrequent with high severity and we recently experienced an elevated level of large losses, particularly for accident year 2019. Due to increased uncertainty for our umbrella business, we strengthened reserves for certain accident years and estimated ultimate losses for accident year 2022 at what we believe is a prudent level.  On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the quarter was favorable by $46 million for 2021, $24 million for 2022, unfavorable by 2020 by $28 million for 2019, and unfavorable by $1 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2019.  Now let me turn to capital management. We continue to follow a consistent approach that includes share repurchases as part of maintenance intended to offset the issuance of shares through equity compensation plans. However, changing circumstances or opportunities can influence us to repurchase more or less than historical averages. We believe that our quarter end financial strength was excellent and provides ample financial flexibility.  During the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 375,000 shares at an average price per share of $120.05. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as I usually do, with a summary of first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio.  Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.81. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.06. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items, added $0.53. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value per share by $3.67. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $3.33. And we declared $0.69 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $6.29 per share during the first quarter to $75.43 per share.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Mike. It's satisfying to see the steady execution of our initiatives producing these strong results. March and April brought a return of business travel and a return of our headquarters associates working together in person. It's wonderful to see so many familiar faces in the hallway and to be able to get out from behind our desk to visit with agents in our field teams across the country. This return to a bit of normalcy has produced an energy you can feel across our organization, bringing with it lots of optimism for the future of Cincinnati Financial.  As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Jesse, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question is from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: I apologize if you covered this. I didn't think I caught it, but there seems to have been a lot of losses above $1 million, like in $1 million to $5 million range. Is that inflation? Or is that just random noise? Or anything else?\nSteven Johnston: Meyer, this is Steve, and good question. We think it's more in the random noise category for this first quarter. Certainly, inflation, we're keeping a close eye on and so forth. But it's 1 quarter, it was largely in our property lines. And we will continue to keep a close eye on it. We think it was more random noise. And it did reflect about 4 points on the current accident year when comparing it to that 0.9% increase overall in the current accident year.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. Second question, when -- we've been seeing, I guess, some level of wage inflation, which is clearly helping, I guess, with workers' compensation premiums. Is it your sense that the impact on same costs for indemnity are in line with that? Or is there any disparity with how -- with the premium and the loss impacts of higher wages?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. We're keeping a close eye on that as well because with payroll being the exposure basis for workers' compensation, that should help on the premium side. Also, we've got the inflation. I think our -- we feel confident in our workers' comp book. It's the loss ratios have been rising as the competitive environment in the industry and NCCI have decreased rates. But we still feel good in terms of what we've done, in terms of really working workers' compensation down as a percentage of our overall commercial premium. But at the same time, supporting agents and -- on what we feel to be the best risk, the most adequately priced risks.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And if I can throw in one other real quick question. One of the competitors in the high-net worth homeowner space has talked about double-digit loss trends there. Does that match what you're seeing in your book?\nSteven Johnston: No, I don't think we've been seeing double-digit loss trends in our book, no. And we do feel good about the high-net worth book. Thank you. Meyer.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle: I've got a few questions. So Meyer kind of touched on it a little bit. But I guess the increase in the current accident year loss ratio in the commercial lines segment, is that primarily attributable to the number of large losses in the quarter? Or is there kind of more work beneath the surface there?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. And if we would break the commercial lines segment down, the current accident year rose by 1.2 points, and the effect of large losses on that was 5.1 points. So well more than the amount of the total increase in the current accident year.\nMark Dwelle: So if -- I mean, there must be some normalized kind of large loss load though that would be kind of embedded in a normal combined ratio. So if I was to try to -- if your large losses were more like normal, would there have been, I guess, a 2- or 3-point improvement, I guess, in the accident year loss ratio, kind of all else equal?\nSteven Johnston: That's a good question. I don't have that handy. We've got it, but the -- the over time there but I can tell you for the quarter -- the first quarter here of 2022, it was 8.6 points in total in large losses over $1 million for the current accident year. For the first quarter of 2021, it was $3.5 million. So that difference is the $5.1 million that I just mentioned. So I feel -- it's like more of a feeling right now not having the numbers, but that $3.5 million seems more normal, feels more normal.\nMark Dwelle: Got it. Okay. Marc -- go ahead.\nStephen Spray: Mark -- I'm sorry. No, this is Steve Spray, Mark. I was just going to add that it's a normal process for us on any large loss that we take a look at risk category, geography, the policy inception date and agency or field marketing territory to see if we can any trends or patterns. And we have not. And like Steve said, we feel it's 1 quarter. And I think it's going to be more important to look at it over a longer period of time, but it is something that we absolutely watch on a regular basis.\nSteven Johnston: While we still have you Mark, Dennis, as usual, is quick to help me out with the numbers. And in terms of the -- what we're seeing, I could turn you to Page 65 of our Q and -- or is it the K?\nDennis McDaniel: The K.\nSteven Johnston: I'm sorry, the K. And there it is, more, I would say, a little bit higher than what I said more in the 4% range. The last -- 2021 was the current accident year losses above $1 million, $4.2 million; $3.6 million for 2020; and 4.6% for '19. And then we had another -- for that over $5 million. So that was in the range of $1 million to $5 million. 1.8, 0.9 and 0.5, respectively. So more in that, say, 5, 5.5 range for that.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That's helpful. It definitely helps clarify kind of what the more normalized run rate might really look like. The second question, and I know this is a little bit of a long shot. But is there -- do you have any exposure to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, either via the Cincinnati Re or the Cincinnati Global book? I know historically, you've written some aviation, but I didn't know if there was anything that might be impacted.\nSteven Johnston: Yes. We -- it wouldn't be in aviation, but we have had a little bit of loss in CGU. It's about $5 million. So not a big amount to the organization. And really, hearts go out to all the people there in Ukraine for the suffering that's going on. For Cincinnati Re, it's de minimis in terms of loss, and we'll continue to keep an eye on it. But about $5 million for us for the quarter in total.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That's helpful. And then last question, I guess, kind of related to the investment portfolio. Do you have a sense of about how much of your portfolio might mature and roll over the course of, say, the next 12 months or the balance of '22? I'm really just trying to get a sense of kind of what portion of the fixed income portfolio will have the opportunity to renew at the relatively higher new money rates that we're all seeing right now.\nMichael Sewell: Yes, Mark. I do actually have that information. So this is looking the balance of 2022, about 4.4% of the portfolio; '23 6.3%; '24, just 8%; and '25, 9.3%. And book yields on that range is from 3.7% up to about 4.5% in 2025.\nOperator: . Your next question from the line of John Heagney of Dowling & Partners.\nJohn Heagney: I had a question on your multiyear policies in commercial. How does that impact your ability to reprice for the inflation we're seeing over the past 3 to 4 months?\nStephen Spray: Yes, John, Steve Spray. Yes, we're committed to that 3-year policy. We think it's important to our agents and our policyholders. It's consistent with our desire to have long-term relationships. And so when we can get an adequate rate for the risk terms and conditions, we're keen to offer a 3-year policy on our commercial packages. Just so you know on that, too, or maybe to give you a little more color, what that does is that really locks in the rate for the property, the general liability, the crime and the inland marine coverages.  And I would say this to you, too, is every year, whether it be those policies that are renewing off of a 3-year or the coverages that are subject to annual adjustment, about 75% of our commercial premiums are subject to an anniversary adjustment even with that 3-year policy. Does that make sense?\nJohn Heagney: Yes. So essentially, I have a 3-year rate, but I can adjust it for the change in TIV. So that would be an inflation adjustment on an annual basis. Is that --\nStephen Spray: You can adjust it -- yes, you can adjust it for an inflation on TIV. And right now, that's -- we're running that in the high single digits. And you also -- say, your general liability, which would typically have your exposure, your premiums are based off of gross sales or payroll. As those increase, the premium goes up, it's just that the rate is locked in.\nJohn Heagney: Right. Okay. How much of your portfolio overall is multiyear, if I just think of it crudely in terms of net premium written in commercial?\nStephen Spray: Yes, it's about 60% of our policy count.\nJohn Heagney: Okay. Then the next question I had, on CGU and then with your new delegated authority of Lloyd's. How much business is that MGA putting through to your own syndicate versus putting through to other syndicates at Lloyd's. I'm just trying to get a sense for how big the -- that delegated authority business could be. Because, obviously, you have a limit on your capacity at Lloyd's in your syndicate, but if you're writing elsewhere, it would seem that you have a bigger underwriting capability, at least for your agent.\nSteven Johnston: Right. And sure, John. Good question. We're just with our first coverage that we are handling through the delegated authority, and it's a deductible buydown. And for that particular product, and especially given this is our first, it will be for our syndicate. As we look to future and rolling out additional coverages, we would open it up to partnerships with other syndicates over there.\nJohn Heagney: Got it. So I'm asking that a little bit a little bit too far in advance in terms of where you are. And then finally, just 1 last kind of numbers question. E&S, how much of your E&S business is written with a standard insurance contract. So I was just trying to get a sense of how much your agents are leveraging that platform for the standard commercial product they're also offering?\nStephen Spray: Yes. John, Steve Spray. About 50% of the time when our E&S company writes coverage, Cincinnati Insurance company writes business on the standard side. So it's a high percentage. It's key to what we do. It works really well for the agents. It's -- I could get into a lot of detail, having the same claims rep, having -- actually having the same resources at Cincinnati Insurance Company for our agents and for those policyholders, whether it's admitted or non-admitted, is a big, big deal, and we're trying to do more and more of it. And you can see with the growth and the profitability in CSU, both have been extremely strong. So we feel really good about where that is going forward.\nJohn Heagney: And then the rest of the book there, that's not wholesale market stuff, right? That's still giving retail agents better access to the E&S market. Is my understanding correct there?\nStephen Spray: Well, that is correct. That's exactly right. CSU, our E&S carrier and our wholly owned subsidiary, brokerage, C -- what we call C Super, only provides access to retail agents of Cincinnati Insurance company to our non-admitted offering. We do not -- our in-house brokerage does not place business in the broader E&S market. I think that might have been part of your question at the end. Only with our own non-admitted carrier and only for licensed and appointed agents of Cincinnati Insurance Company.\nJohn Heagney: Right, right. Yes. No, I was getting at -- so the strategy is really geared towards making life easier for all your agents. It's just an agent-centric strategy.\nStephen Spray: Absolutely. Everything we do. Yes, everything we do is agency-centric.\nOperator: Thank you, participants. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Steven Johnston for final remarks.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Jesse, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Saturday, May 7, at the Cincinnati Art Museum. You're also welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting available at cinfin.com/investors. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our first quarter results. It was another quarter of good operating performance. Our agency-focused strategy led to profitable growth and reflects well on the skill and dedication of our associates and excellent relationships with terrific independent agents. We reported a net loss of $273 million for the quarter, due to the recognition of a reduction in the fair value of securities held in our equity portfolio.  Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of 2022 was up $31 million or 14% versus a year ago. Our 89.9% first quarter property casualty combined ratio was 1.3 percentage points better than last year's first quarter. The current accident year loss and loss expense ratio before catastrophe loss effects rose slightly compared with accident year 2021 measured at 3 months, reflecting an increase in large losses for our property lines of business.  We again managed our business to healthy levels of policy retention with meaningful average renewal price increases for each of our property casualty insurance segments. Policy retention rates for both commercial and personal lines improved from a year ago to the upper 80% range. Consolidated property casualty net written premiums rose 12% for the first quarter of 2022. Our pricing segmentation efforts continue to support what we believe is profitable growth as our underwriters work to retain and write more profitable accounts while taking appropriate action on opportunities that we determine have inadequate pricing. We also believe renewal pricing during the first quarter was again ahead of our estimate for prospective loss cost trends for each property casualty segment.  Our commercial lines insurance segment continued to experience estimated average renewal price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range, similar to the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, personal lines average renewal price increases slowed by a small amount compared to the fourth quarter, remaining in the low single-digit range. Our excess and surplus lines insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range.  Our commercial lines segment grew first quarter 2022 net written premiums by 8% and with a combined ratio of 92.3%. Our personal lines segment net written premium grew 11%, reflecting our continued planned expansion of high-net worth business produced by our agencies. The segment's first quarter combined ratio of 83.9%, improved 17.2 percentage points from a year ago, driven by lower catastrophe losses. Our excess and surplus lines segment had an 85.9% combined ratio and continued strong growth, with first quarter 2022 net written premiums rising by 25%.  Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, each had a nice quarter with healthy growth. Cincinnati Re grew net written premiums by 30% for the first quarter of 2022 with a combined ratio in the mid-90% range. Cincinnati Global, grew net written premiums by 24%, with a combined ratio also in the mid-90% range.  Our life insurance subsidiary generated first quarter 2022 net income of $10 million, matching last year's first quarter, and grew term life insurance earned premiums by 6%.  I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. VCR was negative 6.9% for the quarter, while net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.9 percentage points. Lower investment valuations during the quarter resulted in the investment gains or losses component contributing negative 8.6 points.  Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight several other important aspects of our financial performance. Thank you, Mike. It's satisfying to see the steady execution of our initiatives producing these strong results. March and April brought a return of business travel and a return of our headquarters associates working together in person. It's wonderful to see so many familiar faces in the hallway and to be able to get out from behind our desk to visit with agents in our field teams across the country. This return to a bit of normalcy has produced an energy you can feel across our organization, bringing with it lots of optimism for the future of Cincinnati Financial.  As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Marc Schambow, Marty Hollenbeck and Theresa Hoffer. Jesse, please open the call for questions. Meyer, this is Steve, and good question. We think it's more in the random noise category for this first quarter. Certainly, inflation, we're keeping a close eye on and so forth. But it's 1 quarter, it was largely in our property lines. And we will continue to keep a close eye on it. We think it was more random noise. And it did reflect about 4 points on the current accident year when comparing it to that 0.9% increase overall in the current accident year. Yes. We're keeping a close eye on that as well because with payroll being the exposure basis for workers' compensation, that should help on the premium side. Also, we've got the inflation. I think our -- we feel confident in our workers' comp book. It's the loss ratios have been rising as the competitive environment in the industry and NCCI have decreased rates. But we still feel good in terms of what we've done, in terms of really working workers' compensation down as a percentage of our overall commercial premium. But at the same time, supporting agents and -- on what we feel to be the best risk, the most adequately priced risks. No, I don't think we've been seeing double-digit loss trends in our book, no. And we do feel good about the high-net worth book. Thank you. Meyer. Yes. And if we would break the commercial lines segment down, the current accident year rose by 1.2 points, and the effect of large losses on that was 5.1 points. So well more than the amount of the total increase in the current accident year. That's a good question. I don't have that handy. We've got it, but the -- the over time there but I can tell you for the quarter -- the first quarter here of 2022, it was 8.6 points in total in large losses over $1 million for the current accident year. For the first quarter of 2021, it was $3.5 million. So that difference is the $5.1 million that I just mentioned. So I feel -- it's like more of a feeling right now not having the numbers, but that $3.5 million seems more normal, feels more normal. While we still have you Mark, Dennis, as usual, is quick to help me out with the numbers. And in terms of the -- what we're seeing, I could turn you to Page 65 of our Q and -- or is it the K? I'm sorry, the K. And there it is, more, I would say, a little bit higher than what I said more in the 4% range. The last -- 2021 was the current accident year losses above $1 million, $4.2 million; $3.6 million for 2020; and 4.6% for '19. And then we had another -- for that over $5 million. So that was in the range of $1 million to $5 million. 1.8, 0.9 and 0.5, respectively. So more in that, say, 5, 5.5 range for that. Yes. We -- it wouldn't be in aviation, but we have had a little bit of loss in CGU. It's about $5 million. So not a big amount to the organization. And really, hearts go out to all the people there in Ukraine for the suffering that's going on. For Cincinnati Re, it's de minimis in terms of loss, and we'll continue to keep an eye on it. But about $5 million for us for the quarter in total. Right. And sure, John. Good question. We're just with our first coverage that we are handling through the delegated authority, and it's a deductible buydown. And for that particular product, and especially given this is our first, it will be for our syndicate. As we look to future and rolling out additional coverages, we would open it up to partnerships with other syndicates over there. Thank you, Jesse, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Saturday, May 7, at the Cincinnati Art Museum. You're also welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting available at cinfin.com/investors. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our Fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our year end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you\u2019ll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses maybe made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I will turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, and I am happy to see that our hard work is reflected in the progress we are making. Net income rose $170 million to nearly $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $18 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities still held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 78% or $157 million versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 42% higher than 2022. Our 87.5%, fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 7.4 percentage points better than in 2022, with the catastrophe loss ratio representing 6.5 points of the improvement. That strong underwriting performance followed our recent pattern of improvement, resulting in a 94.9% full year 2023 combined ratio. That was 3.2 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 0.5 points in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios were also favorable compared with 2022, improving 2.1 percentage points to 85.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.8 points to 88.4% for the year. We saw positive momentum in many areas of operating performance. Growth for consolidated property casualty net written premiums accelerated, reaching 13% for the fourth quarter, including 10% for renewal premiums and 30% for new business premiums. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and to counter the continuing effects and inflation on insured losses, we combine pricing segmentation by risk with average price increases and careful risk selection. Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment, again, averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the fourth quarter included auto, continuing in the low double-digit range and homeowner continuing near the low end of the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates in 2023 were similar to 2022, with our Commercial Lines segment down slightly, but still in the upper 80% range and our Personal Lines segment, up slightly but still in the low to mid-90% range. Briefly reviewing operating performance by Insurance segment, I\u2019ll focus on the full year results. Although I will note that each segment improved their combined ratios in the fourth quarter compared to last year as they continue to grow profitably. Our Commercial segment improved its full year 2023 combined ratio by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022 and grew net written premiums by 4%. Our Personal Lines segment grew net written premiums by 26%, with growth for middle-market business in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business, its combined ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year due to the catastrophe loss ratio rising 3.7 points. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment was very profitable, producing a 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% with net written premium growth of 14%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable. Cincinnati Re\u2019s full year combined ratio was an excellent 77.7%. Its net written premiums were 5% lower than in 2022, reflecting our opportunistic positioning of the portfolio through evolving market conditions. Cincinnati Global\u2019s combined ratio was also excellent at 75.5%, with 22% growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary grew profit and premiums too as full year 2023 net income rose 15% and earned premiums grew 4%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2024 are fairly similar to 2023, other than an average premium rate increase of approximately 12%. The primary objective of our Property Catastrophe Treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty\u2019s main change this year is adding another $100 million of coverage, increasing the top of the program from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Should we experience a 2024 catastrophe event totaling $1.2 billion in losses, we will retain $423 million compared with $617 million in 2023 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2024 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $180 million, more than the actual $136 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2023 due to additional coverage, rate increase and subject premium growth. Folks who follow our company know we prefer to track our success over a long time horizon. Consistent with that approach, we set a target for the value creation ratio, our primary performance measure, at an annual average of 10% to 13% over the next 5 years. We believe the VCR is an appropriate measure since it\u2019s driven by strong combined ratio results, premium growth that exceeds the industry average and contributions from our investment portfolio. Since 2016, our combined ratio of 5-year average has ranged from 94.3% to 96.1%, near the low end of the longer term target of 95% to 100% we have disclosed for many years. And for more than a decade, we have recorded results ahead of the industry for premium growth on a 5-year compound annual growth rate basis. Because we believe we can continue to perform at a high level we are setting our sights on a longer term combined ratio better than the past target, now targeting a 5-year average of 92% to 98%. While we will no longer publicly disclose annual targets for combined ratio and premium growth, we expect to continue our robust disclosure detail to help investors model and form their own expectations of future results. This doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll ignore the shorter term results. We recognize that it also means that to achieve our revised long-term target range, some years we need to reach combined ratios towards the lower end, knowing there could be some years like 2022 that come in near the higher end. I\u2019ll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with the value creation ratio. Our 15.2%, 5-year annual average VCR as of year end 2023 exceeded our target range of 10% to 13%. VCR of 19.5% for full year 2023 included a contribution of 9.1% from net income before investment gains or losses while higher valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 10.4%. Now Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results and other important aspects of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income was a significant part of higher net income and improved operating results, up 15% for the fourth quarter and 14% for full year 2023 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income was up 7% for the quarter largely due to a special dividend from one of our stock holdings. On a full year 2023 basis, we added to the equity portfolio with net purchases totaling $14 million. Bond interest income, again, grew at a good pace, up 19% for the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to add fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $1.4 billion for full year 2023. The fourth quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.48% and for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 32 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2023 was 6.13%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. Before tax effects, the net gain was $1.50 billion for the equity portfolio and $621 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of 2023, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.1 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $570 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income as did rising bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2023 was just over $2 billion matching last year. Regarding expense management, we always intend to strive to an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. Our full year 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio at 30.0% was in line with 2022. While the fourth quarter ratio was 1.3 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to higher profit sharing commissions for agencies and associate related expenses. Next, I will summarize loss reserve activity. Our approach remains consistent and aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Our quarterly study of updated paid and case reserve loss and loss expense data for our commercial casualty line of business considered how fourth quarter incurred amounts were higher than we expected, especially for the general liability coverages for older accident years. To reflect the continued uncertainty of ultimate losses and loss expenses, we increased our estimates for several prior accident years to levels more likely to be adequate. The net amount of the fourth quarter increase was $51 million, including $29 million for accident years prior to 2019. Commercial casualty unfavorable reserve development on a full year 2023 basis was fairly small at $15 million. Only 0.5% of the year-end 2022 reserve balance. Prior accident year reserve development for commercial umbrella during 2023 and was a favorable $6 million. During 2023, our net addition to total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $682 million, including $634 million for the IBNR portion. For full year 2023, we experienced $215 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.8 percentage points, marking 35 consecutive years of net favorable development on prior accident year loss and loss expense reserves. On an online basis by accident year, net reserve development for full year 2023 included a favorable $137 million for 2022, favorable $21 million for 2021, favorable $68 million for 2020 and an unfavorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. I\u2019ll conclude with a few capital management highlights. Another area where our approach includes careful consideration of the long-term. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not repurchase any shares. Our view of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both remain in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continue to be under 10%. And our year-end 2023 book value of $77.06 per share means the $12.1 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity provides plenty of opportunity for profitable growth by supporting $8.1 billion of annual property casualty net written premiums. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to comment on our recent leadership and Board announcements. Effective at our annual shareholder meeting in May, President, Steve Spray, will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I\u2019m confident in his ability to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for associates, agents and shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board. We also announced the addition of Steve and Peter Wu as Cincinnati Financial Directors. Peter has exceptional experience in the world of predictive analytics, data modeling and artificial intelligence. I\u2019m honored that he has agreed to join our Board. Finally, the Board set the stage for a 64th consecutive year of raising shareholder dividends by increasing the dividend 8% to $0.81 per share. From the Board to the leadership team, to associates at every level of our company, we have the perfect people in place to create a bright future for Cincinnati Financial. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Rocco, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off, congrats to Mr. Spray on your news and Steve Johnston, say it and so, but you\u2019ll be missed, but look forward to hopefully hear more from you in the future. But congrats to all you guys on that.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Michael.\nMichael Phillips: I guess \u2013 you are welcome. My first question is on the PYD, I guess. It looks like some of the issues there might be on the umbrella maybe some large royalty you guys are great for giving disclosure on this stuff. But can you talk \u2013 some of the exhibits talked about the large loss activity and the claim count there certainly went up quite a bit in the quarter is just because the inflation impact of that and what\u2019s happening there. But can you talk about any changes in maybe the mix of your limit profile from 2022 into 2023 and maybe some of that mix might be impacted? Are you writing more higher limits, I guess, is the punch line there? And then maybe talk about how I think there is a perception that your 3-year policy terms may give you some shield when rates get soft, and pricing gets soft, but maybe are you sort of hand-tied a little bit if there is more of an urgent need to re-rate on these higher limit policies? Thanks.\nSteve Johnston: Hey, Mike. This is Steve Johnston. I\u2019ll start off and turn it over to Steve Spray here. It\u2019s just with the commercial casualty, it was not umbrella. We addressed that \u2013 we think really early a year ago, second quarter, I believe, and we\u2019ve really \u2013 we think pain that, brought that under control, and we\u2019re actually producing an underwriting profit now for our umbrella lines. So it\u2019s the commercial casualty part other than umbrella. And when we get to this point, we\u2019re looking at our year-end reserve analysis for all the lines of business, and it gives us the chance to put us in a position to look at the data for the full year. So our focus is on estimating the full year. And for the full year, for commercial casualty, including umbrella, all of that, and we\u2019re showing just under $15 million or 1 loss ratio point in adverse development on the prior accident years, as Mike mentioned. Now to further put that in perspective, as Mike said, it\u2019s $15 million is just 0.5% of the casualty reserves and 0.2% of the total reserves carried at December 31, 2022. So it\u2019s really as we look at the full year, not a big number. In fact, also for the full year, our total property casualty accident year development was favorable, 2.8 loss ratio points. That\u2019s an improvement from the 2.3 points of the prior year and also that 2.8 is very much in the range of where we\u2019ve been for the last several years. And I always want to point out that makes now 35 years consecutively that we\u2019ve had favorable development for Cincinnati Insurance and our reserves. There was quarterly volatility through the year. For example, we reported favorable development for prior accident years of $34 million or 9.2 loss ratio points for the second quarter for commercial casualty. As we looked at the fourth quarter, and as Mike mentioned, and you\u2019re mentioning there was more larger losses. I wouldn\u2019t consider it a trend, but there was more larger losses in the fourth quarter just as there were maybe a dearth of that in the second quarter. The advantage is we get to look at the full year here and do as we always do and try to be very prudent. We\u2019re reading what\u2019s going on with the industry. And we thought for the full year, it would not be prudent to release reserves or have favorable development on the prior years. So I know the fourth quarter, that 14 loss ratio points appears to be a big number, and it is a big number. But I think in context of looking at the full year and what you\u2019ll see in the Schedule P, what you\u2019ll see in the 10-K, I think when you combine it with the other lines where workers\u2019 comp, we did the same type of a procedure, and we had 31-point loss ratio points of favorable development, also had favorable development for commercial auto and most of our lines, favorable development again for the 35th year. To keep a 35-year streak like that, you have to take action when you see it. We saw the larger losses in the fourth quarter. And I think to bring the year in where we thought it would be a prudent position not to release casualty reserves. We arrived at our best estimate in the number that we produced. My turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the other question that you had?\nSteve Spray: Yes. Mike, like Steve said, we had \u2013 it was not umbrella. We did notice as you recall, back in 2022, some challenges with the umbrella line, we jumped on that, working with our agents and Commercial Lines underwriting. The limits profile there has always been the vast majority of those accounts, those umbrellas. It\u2019s a low limit book profile \u2013 has probably become a little \u2013 even more low limit over the last 1.5 years as we took action, both pricing and capacity on specific segments, some specific classes of business and then some specific venues where we felt that the environment was just a little more difficult. Steve also mentioned that umbrella line was modestly profitable in 2023. And we\u2019ve got a long-term profitable record with umbrella, and we look to continue to grow that. So that was, I think, your limits question. The other question you had, Michael, is on the 3-year policy. We\u2019re as committed to that 3-year policy as we ever have been. I think it resonates with policyholders and with our agents. So our desire for long-term relationships. Our 3-year policy \u2013 package policy actually outperforms a 1-year contract from an underwriting standpoint. Our underwriters use the art and science of pricing. And you can see \u2013 we can see it in the book that they \u2013 they are using it the right way, and we\u2019re getting profitable results. from the 3-year policy. You mentioned the muting effect with pricing and make a long story short, about 75% of our premium in commercial lines, even on a 3-year policy are adjusted on an annual basis. So 75% of the premiums are being adjusted annually. Again, just committed to that 3-year \u2013 and we think it\u2019s \u2013 again, it shows the marketplace that we want long-term relationships and our retentions at the first and second anniversary of a 3-year policy are about 10 points higher than we actually have a renewal. So there is an added benefit to it as well. Hopefully, the answer would be helpful.\nMichael Phillips: Yes, it does. Yes, thank you guys both very much. It sounds like you are not concerned about what looks like a spike in the large loss activity. You certainly have the annual track record to prove it. So thank you for that. I guess my second question is on personal auto, a real quick turnaround in the profitability in commercial auto. I guess, is there anything that\u2019s kind of a one-off to drive that down to 66.7 current accident year loss ratio on personal auto that drove it down or is it just rates running in? And is that kind of a good run-rate from here given where your rates have been? Thanks.\nSteve Spray: Mike could you \u2013 did you say commercial auto or personal auto? You broke up.\nMichael Phillips: Personal auto, if I said commercial, I meant personal auto, that\u2019s what I said, personal auto.\nSteve Spray: Yes. You just broke up. I didn\u2019t hear. Yes. So again, Steve Spray. Yes, I think it is a lot of \u2013 it\u2019s blocking and tackling. It\u2019s sophisticated pricing that we on to continue to develop segmentation precision in the pricing. And as you know, I think inflation probably hit the personal auto line as hard as any line of business in P&C. And we reacted accordingly, and it\u2019s a lot of rate that is continuing to burn into that book.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. So really nothing \u2013 any kind of anomalies, but that looks like \u2013 it sounds like a good rate kind of at least a trend from here.\nSteve Spray: Yes. The only other thing I might add is, over time, our mix of business and personal lines is moving. We\u2019re growing both the middle market segment and high net worth. But over time, we think that the high net worth business, as it always has or traditionally has \u2013 will outperform the middle market space and that personal auto is a less percentage of the package with high net worth or private client than it is on the middle market. So I think mix of business is probably helping us as well.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys. And congrats again to Steve and Steve.\nSteve Spray: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. I guess sticking \u2013 going back to the reserving color. Just trying to understand bigger picture. So the reserve charge in casualty, as you stated, on an absolute basis, isn\u2019t a huge number. And so just trying to understand, are you making a material change to kind of your forward loss trend, too, given what you\u2019ve learned in casualty? Or is this just simply the Cinci way of doing things, you\u2019re reacting to bad news trying to get ahead of it. And this is just really a small tweak that doesn\u2019t kind of touch on the changes you made back in \u201822 on umbrella?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. Good question, and it\u2019s the latter, Mike. We don\u2019t see it as a material change in our trend. We feel very good about the position that we are in terms of our rate versus our trend. And keep in mind, we\u2019re forward-looking we\u2019re looking for where do we think the loss costs will be out in the prospective policy period. We feel good about that. A little bit historic as we do see good improvement in those accident year ex-cat combined ratios, which I think gives credence to it. And so it\u2019s more of the latter of doing things in Cincinnati way, recognizing some large losses when we see them and also what\u2019s going on in the industry and being prudent with our reserves to keep that 35 years of favorable development stream going to 36.\nMike Zaremski: Understood. And just curious, in a good way, Cincinnati is my understanding, kind of branching into, I guess, broadening the customer base, you can write policies for on the commercial side in terms of going down market into BOP and I believe, into larger commercial too. And just curious as \u2013 if I\u2019m right about that, as you\u2019ve gone on this journey in recent years, does that just kind of bring in a little bit more potential volatility in the early years as you kind of learn more about those kind of newer client segments? Is there anything there?\nSteve Spray: No, I don\u2019t think it brings in any more volatility than what we would normally experience. Mike. We\u2019ve always had an agency strategy. So we \u2013 we\u2019re trying to be as important to each agency that we do business with and be an important partner for all segments, whether it\u2019s small like the box you mentioned, middle markets or larger accounts. We\u2019ve always written small business. We\u2019ve always written larger accounts. That small business, a lot of times, is more of a technology play. And we have \u2013 we have launched just an excellent platform, not because I say so, but because our agency feedback is telling us that it\u2019s intuitive and it\u2019s easy. So I expect that you will see us continue to make big strides in the small business area. And then on the, what we call, key accounts, larger accounts, commercially, we have added a lot of expertise in that area, and we are growing it \u2013 we were growing it in a conservative manner and very \u2013 underwriting profit first, but our runway on larger accounts and keep moving, I guess upstream as one might say is, I think is very positive too.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And lastly, just on the \u2013 there is \u2013 in my understanding, there is no change to the value creation ratio target, but you are bringing down the \u2013 or you are improving the long-term combined ratio target. Maybe just can kind of just help us clarify why not \u2013 what brought about that change? And is there any financial incentives that are going to change on a forward-looking basis when we look at the proxy or whatnot because of the combined ratio change?\nSteve Johnston: Good question. No, there will not be any change in the compensation targets in that regard. We have been very, I think consistent in the combined ratio. We have got 12 years in a row now with a combined ratio under 100. And so we have seen it be as low as 88.3. And so we felt that we could lower that long-term target down and put us in a position to continue to be long-term thinkers there. I think there has also been great consistency in the value creation ratio. If we look at the 5-year average VCR going back to the 5 years ended 2013, all of those 5-year ending years from 2013 through 2023 have all been double digits. So, we are just reflecting our long-term focus and raising the bar a bit on where we put that long-term combined ratio for you.\nMike Zaremski: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Greg Peters at Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Well, good morning everyone and congratulations on your 35-year track record and Mr. Spray, you have your work cut out for you to keep that going for the next 5 years, so good luck to you on that. Can we step back and \u2013 you provided some data around pricing. And maybe you can help us frame how to think about new business growth, both commercial, personal and E&S as we think about the next 12 months when we compare it to what happened in \u201823?\nSteve Spray: I would \u2013 this is Steve Spray, Greg. Let me start with Commercial Lines. We use the same predictive modeling tools and have our field underwriters use the art of underwriting and balance that. And if you recall, we started off 2023. New business was, we were under some pressure for new business. We were keeping our pricing discipline going there. And as the year progressed, I would like to say we kind of saw the market come our way. And new businesses continue to get better and better throughout the year in \u201823 and again, kept that pricing and underwriting discipline. Personal Lines, the new business there and the net written premium growth has just been strong throughout the year. And I just think we are in such a good position going forward in Personal Lines as well, because we are \u2013 like I have said earlier, we have an agency strategy, and we have become a premier market, both in middle market and high net worth for our agencies, and they tell us that regularly. And with our $12 billion of GAAP equity supported $8 billion of premium. We are in a good position with our balance sheet to continue to grow Personal Lines. Through this, I will call it tumultuous market. So, feel really good about that. On the E&S side, 90.6% combined ratio are better now for 11 years in a row. It\u2019s about 90% casualty. The submission counts there continue to be strong. You can see that the new business throughout 2023 was strong and I don\u2019t see any reason why that will continue into 2024 as well.\nGreg Peters: Okay. Thanks for the color there. I was also listening to your comments about the movements around the reserves. And I was just wondering if you had any comments on just the paid loss trend. It looks like paid losses grew a little bit faster for the full year \u201823 than they did in \u201822. Just wondering, is that just \u2013 is there any noise in there or anything you would like to call out?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I would think there really isn\u2019t anything to call out there, Greg. I think it\u2019s just, we are growing and then paid losses and we have seen that fluctuate from year-to-year. And so there would be some noise there.\nGreg Peters: Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Jane [ph] on for Meyer. Thank you for taking my question.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: My first question \u2013 thank you. On the follow-up for commercial casualty reserves, just mainly on the $51 million and $29 million reserve charge prior to accident year 2019, you mentioned some \u2013 you outlined some large losses. Is there any other new trends you are seeing in 4Q?\nSteve Johnston: No, not really. I think that I don\u2019t see it as a trend. I think we did recognize it. Like I say, there was some volatility through the year. We would have had less of that in the second quarter when we released or recognize the 9.2 points of favorable development. I think we just look \u2013 are looking at this now as the whole year and doing our best to put our best estimate forward for the year, which amounted to the $15 million and never want to minimize $15 million. But I think in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s pretty close to a wash and puts us in a position to continue to have the type of reserve strength and quality of balance sheet that we do.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. My second question is on the combined ratio target. You mentioned a 5-year average of 92% to 98% to middle point at 95%. So, does that imply that less than 95% combined ratio for \u201824, or is there any color you can provide for \u201824?\nSteve Johnston: No, it doesn\u2019t imply a 95% for 2024. And so we are not really giving a 2024 number here. We are again, focusing on the long-term that we have had consistent underwriting profits. We think that the long-term of 95% to 100% is something that we can strive for the long time \u2013 long-term to do better and have that be 92% to 98%. We know there will be some years it will be a little bit higher. I think we have been under 100% for 12 consecutive years. I think the highest was 98.1%, the lowest 88.3%. And so there is going to be variation in the market cycles and weather and so forth. We want to focus on the long-term where we continue to grow above the industry average, do it at a good underwriting profit and invest well such that, that value creation ratio stays double digit. There will be some volatility there as investments are a little bit volatility, but over the long pull, which is what we shoot for, we are a long-term strategy team here, we think we can lower that long-term combined ratio range from 95% to 100% to 92% to 98%.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Perfect. Thank you. Can I sneak in one more? Just on the expense ratio, we are seeing it trending up quarter-over-quarter in 2023. You mentioned some high share commission, etcetera, in 4Q. How should we think about the run rate for 2024? Any kind of color you have there would be great.\nMike Sewell: Yes. Thank you for the question. This is Mike Sewell. I think we have kind of really said over the last couple of years that we have been targeting a 30% expense ratio. And so we are still looking at that. We are shooting for that. And we are actually there for the last 2 years. So, I am kind of setting my sights. And we are not going to give up. We are going to keep investing where we need to invest, keep controlling costs where we think we can control it better. And any time that we can get that below 30%, we are going to try to do that. So, I am targeting for below 30%, but I am happy where it is, but we can always improve.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much.\nMike Sewell: Thank you.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Grace Carter, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGrace Carter: Hi everyone. Good morning.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning Grace.\nGrace Carter: I was looking for the commercial casualty reserve development. You mentioned that, I think $29 million of it was related to prior to 2019. I was hoping we could zoom-in on the remaining piece. And I guess just considering how claims activity was suppressed during the pandemic, if you can help us think through how the pandemic years are developing relative to your expectations? And just any sort of surprise in the trends there? And how much of the commercial casualty total reserve base we should think of accident years 2020 to 2022 comprising?\nSteve Johnston: Hi Grace. This is Steve Johnston. I think we can get you those numbers. I do not have like the carried reserves for those years in front of me here what we would carry for those years. I do feel that we are looking at the pandemic years is, obviously, there were challenges we were going through the pandemic with the economy slowing down in ports and so forth. But I do think that now it\u2019s been well behaved.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And I guess kind of considering how interest rates have been \u2013 were lower in the decade following the financial crisis with a pretty sharp change in that over the past couple of years. Conventional industry wisdom has kind of historically suggested that if you have better investment income, maybe you can let your combined ratio float up a little bit higher. So, I guess considering the potential for higher interest rates to stick around for longer. I was just wondering your thoughts on that and if you think that, that no longer holds in light of the updated combined ratio guidance and just the extent to which the prevailing interest rate environment influences, how you think about your outlook?\nSteve Johnston: Great question. I think we would be slow to change those combined ratio targets because interest rates, as we have seen, can fluctuate more quickly than the loss ratios of books and business. And so I think it would be risky to see high interest rates or higher interest rates and react by lowering your standard on a combined ratio when there would be a good chance, I think over the next 10 years that interest rates would go back down. I would expect that over the next 10 years, a lot of what I have seen in terms of interest rate expectation is to go down. If you got yourself in a situation where you reacted to the higher interest rates with a higher combined ratio target, you can\u2019t recalibrate and cash back up as quickly as those interest rates change. So, we are going to stay conservative in terms of our loss ratio targets.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Jack on for Mike. Thanks for taking our follow-up. I am just \u2013 you guided to buying more reinsurance and seeding more premiums. Any color on how you expect those changes to impact the combined ratio in 2024?\nSteve Spray: Jack, this is Steve Spray. We \u2013 I will say, on the property cat treaty, we buy that for balance sheet protection. As last \u2013 if you recall, last year, we increased our retention on the property cap from $100 million to $200 million. We renewed it for \u201824 with that same $200 million retention. And we also then bought another $100 million on top. So, now the total program is $1.2 billion. We obviously balance the cost of that with what we are trying to do on the loss ratio, but again, always keeping in mind that it\u2019s for balance sheet protection, not earnings. I would also note that in that $1.2 billion tower that we have for the property cat, we also filled out some more of the \u2013 we will call it, maybe the middle layers this year than what we did for the 2023 year. So, no guidance on loss ratio for you on that, but just maybe a little background or color on the property cat treaty.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Rocco and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2024 call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Thank you, Dennis and good morning. Thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, and I am happy to see that our hard work is reflected in the progress we are making. Net income rose $170 million to nearly $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared with the fourth quarter of last year, including $18 million more benefit on an after-tax basis in the fair value of securities still held in our equity portfolio. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up 78% or $157 million versus a year ago. And on a full year basis, it was 42% higher than 2022. Our 87.5%, fourth quarter property casualty combined ratio was 7.4 percentage points better than in 2022, with the catastrophe loss ratio representing 6.5 points of the improvement. That strong underwriting performance followed our recent pattern of improvement, resulting in a 94.9% full year 2023 combined ratio. That was 3.2 percentage points better than last year, including a decrease of 0.5 points in the catastrophe loss ratio. Our 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios were also favorable compared with 2022, improving 2.1 percentage points to 85.7% for the fourth quarter and 1.8 points to 88.4% for the year. We saw positive momentum in many areas of operating performance. Growth for consolidated property casualty net written premiums accelerated, reaching 13% for the fourth quarter, including 10% for renewal premiums and 30% for new business premiums. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve performance and to counter the continuing effects and inflation on insured losses, we combine pricing segmentation by risk with average price increases and careful risk selection. Estimated average renewal price increases for the fourth quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment, again, averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the fourth quarter included auto, continuing in the low double-digit range and homeowner continuing near the low end of the high single-digit range. Policy retention rates in 2023 were similar to 2022, with our Commercial Lines segment down slightly, but still in the upper 80% range and our Personal Lines segment, up slightly but still in the low to mid-90% range. Briefly reviewing operating performance by Insurance segment, I'll focus on the full year results. Although I will note that each segment improved their combined ratios in the fourth quarter compared to last year as they continue to grow profitably. Our Commercial segment improved its full year 2023 combined ratio by 3.0 percentage points compared with 2022 and grew net written premiums by 4%. Our Personal Lines segment grew net written premiums by 26%, with growth for middle-market business in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business, its combined ratio was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year due to the catastrophe loss ratio rising 3.7 points. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment was very profitable, producing a 2023 combined ratio of 90.6% with net written premium growth of 14%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global were also very profitable. Cincinnati Re's full year combined ratio was an excellent 77.7%. Its net written premiums were 5% lower than in 2022, reflecting our opportunistic positioning of the portfolio through evolving market conditions. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 75.5%, with 22% growth in net written premiums. Our Life Insurance subsidiary grew profit and premiums too as full year 2023 net income rose 15% and earned premiums grew 4%. On January 1 of this year, we again renewed each of our primary property casualty treaties that transfer part of our risk to reinsurers. For our per risk treaties, terms and conditions for 2024 are fairly similar to 2023, other than an average premium rate increase of approximately 12%. The primary objective of our Property Catastrophe Treaty is to protect our balance sheet. The treaty's main change this year is adding another $100 million of coverage, increasing the top of the program from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Should we experience a 2024 catastrophe event totaling $1.2 billion in losses, we will retain $423 million compared with $617 million in 2023 for an event of that magnitude. We expect 2024 ceded premiums for these treaties in total to be approximately $180 million, more than the actual $136 million of ceded premiums for these treaties in 2023 due to additional coverage, rate increase and subject premium growth. Folks who follow our company know we prefer to track our success over a long time horizon. Consistent with that approach, we set a target for the value creation ratio, our primary performance measure, at an annual average of 10% to 13% over the next 5 years. We believe the VCR is an appropriate measure since it's driven by strong combined ratio results, premium growth that exceeds the industry average and contributions from our investment portfolio. Since 2016, our combined ratio of 5-year average has ranged from 94.3% to 96.1%, near the low end of the longer term target of 95% to 100% we have disclosed for many years. And for more than a decade, we have recorded results ahead of the industry for premium growth on a 5-year compound annual growth rate basis. Because we believe we can continue to perform at a high level we are setting our sights on a longer term combined ratio better than the past target, now targeting a 5-year average of 92% to 98%. While we will no longer publicly disclose annual targets for combined ratio and premium growth, we expect to continue our robust disclosure detail to help investors model and form their own expectations of future results. This doesn't mean that we'll ignore the shorter term results. We recognize that it also means that to achieve our revised long-term target range, some years we need to reach combined ratios towards the lower end, knowing there could be some years like 2022 that come in near the higher end. I'll conclude my prepared remarks as usual with the value creation ratio. Our 15.2%, 5-year annual average VCR as of year end 2023 exceeded our target range of 10% to 13%. VCR of 19.5% for full year 2023 included a contribution of 9.1% from net income before investment gains or losses while higher valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 10.4%. Now Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight investment results and other important aspects of our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on our recent leadership and Board announcements. Effective at our annual shareholder meeting in May, President, Steve Spray, will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his ability to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for associates, agents and shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board. We also announced the addition of Steve and Peter Wu as Cincinnati Financial Directors. Peter has exceptional experience in the world of predictive analytics, data modeling and artificial intelligence. I'm honored that he has agreed to join our Board. Finally, the Board set the stage for a 64th consecutive year of raising shareholder dividends by increasing the dividend 8% to $0.81 per share. From the Board to the leadership team, to associates at every level of our company, we have the perfect people in place to create a bright future for Cincinnati Financial. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Rocco, please open the call for questions. Thanks, Michael. Hey, Mike. This is Steve Johnston. I'll start off and turn it over to Steve Spray here. It's just with the commercial casualty, it was not umbrella. We addressed that \u2013 we think really early a year ago, second quarter, I believe, and we've really \u2013 we think pain that, brought that under control, and we're actually producing an underwriting profit now for our umbrella lines. So it's the commercial casualty part other than umbrella. And when we get to this point, we're looking at our year-end reserve analysis for all the lines of business, and it gives us the chance to put us in a position to look at the data for the full year. So our focus is on estimating the full year. And for the full year, for commercial casualty, including umbrella, all of that, and we're showing just under $15 million or 1 loss ratio point in adverse development on the prior accident years, as Mike mentioned. Now to further put that in perspective, as Mike said, it's $15 million is just 0.5% of the casualty reserves and 0.2% of the total reserves carried at December 31, 2022. So it's really as we look at the full year, not a big number. In fact, also for the full year, our total property casualty accident year development was favorable, 2.8 loss ratio points. That's an improvement from the 2.3 points of the prior year and also that 2.8 is very much in the range of where we've been for the last several years. And I always want to point out that makes now 35 years consecutively that we've had favorable development for Cincinnati Insurance and our reserves. There was quarterly volatility through the year. For example, we reported favorable development for prior accident years of $34 million or 9.2 loss ratio points for the second quarter for commercial casualty. As we looked at the fourth quarter, and as Mike mentioned, and you're mentioning there was more larger losses. I wouldn't consider it a trend, but there was more larger losses in the fourth quarter just as there were maybe a dearth of that in the second quarter. The advantage is we get to look at the full year here and do as we always do and try to be very prudent. We're reading what's going on with the industry. And we thought for the full year, it would not be prudent to release reserves or have favorable development on the prior years. So I know the fourth quarter, that 14 loss ratio points appears to be a big number, and it is a big number. But I think in context of looking at the full year and what you'll see in the Schedule P, what you'll see in the 10-K, I think when you combine it with the other lines where workers' comp, we did the same type of a procedure, and we had 31-point loss ratio points of favorable development, also had favorable development for commercial auto and most of our lines, favorable development again for the 35th year. To keep a 35-year streak like that, you have to take action when you see it. We saw the larger losses in the fourth quarter. And I think to bring the year in where we thought it would be a prudent position not to release casualty reserves. We arrived at our best estimate in the number that we produced. My turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the other question that you had? Yes. Good question, and it's the latter, Mike. We don't see it as a material change in our trend. We feel very good about the position that we are in terms of our rate versus our trend. And keep in mind, we're forward-looking we're looking for where do we think the loss costs will be out in the prospective policy period. We feel good about that. A little bit historic as we do see good improvement in those accident year ex-cat combined ratios, which I think gives credence to it. And so it's more of the latter of doing things in Cincinnati way, recognizing some large losses when we see them and also what's going on in the industry and being prudent with our reserves to keep that 35 years of favorable development stream going to 36. Good question. No, there will not be any change in the compensation targets in that regard. We have been very, I think consistent in the combined ratio. We have got 12 years in a row now with a combined ratio under 100. And so we have seen it be as low as 88.3. And so we felt that we could lower that long-term target down and put us in a position to continue to be long-term thinkers there. I think there has also been great consistency in the value creation ratio. If we look at the 5-year average VCR going back to the 5 years ended 2013, all of those 5-year ending years from 2013 through 2023 have all been double digits. So, we are just reflecting our long-term focus and raising the bar a bit on where we put that long-term combined ratio for you. Yes. I would think there really isn't anything to call out there, Greg. I think it's just, we are growing and then paid losses and we have seen that fluctuate from year-to-year. And so there would be some noise there. Thank you. Thank you. No, not really. I think that I don't see it as a trend. I think we did recognize it. Like I say, there was some volatility through the year. We would have had less of that in the second quarter when we released or recognize the 9.2 points of favorable development. I think we just look \u2013 are looking at this now as the whole year and doing our best to put our best estimate forward for the year, which amounted to the $15 million and never want to minimize $15 million. But I think in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty close to a wash and puts us in a position to continue to have the type of reserve strength and quality of balance sheet that we do. No, it doesn't imply a 95% for 2024. And so we are not really giving a 2024 number here. We are again, focusing on the long-term that we have had consistent underwriting profits. We think that the long-term of 95% to 100% is something that we can strive for the long time \u2013 long-term to do better and have that be 92% to 98%. We know there will be some years it will be a little bit higher. I think we have been under 100% for 12 consecutive years. I think the highest was 98.1%, the lowest 88.3%. And so there is going to be variation in the market cycles and weather and so forth. We want to focus on the long-term where we continue to grow above the industry average, do it at a good underwriting profit and invest well such that, that value creation ratio stays double digit. There will be some volatility there as investments are a little bit volatility, but over the long pull, which is what we shoot for, we are a long-term strategy team here, we think we can lower that long-term combined ratio range from 95% to 100% to 92% to 98%. Thank you. Good morning Grace. Hi Grace. This is Steve Johnston. I think we can get you those numbers. I do not have like the carried reserves for those years in front of me here what we would carry for those years. I do feel that we are looking at the pandemic years is, obviously, there were challenges we were going through the pandemic with the economy slowing down in ports and so forth. But I do think that now it's been well behaved. Great question. I think we would be slow to change those combined ratio targets because interest rates, as we have seen, can fluctuate more quickly than the loss ratios of books and business. And so I think it would be risky to see high interest rates or higher interest rates and react by lowering your standard on a combined ratio when there would be a good chance, I think over the next 10 years that interest rates would go back down. I would expect that over the next 10 years, a lot of what I have seen in terms of interest rate expectation is to go down. If you got yourself in a situation where you reacted to the higher interest rates with a higher combined ratio target, you can't recalibrate and cash back up as quickly as those interest rates change. So, we are going to stay conservative in terms of our loss ratio targets. Thank you. Thank you, Rocco and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2024 call."

            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Yes. Mike, like Steve said, we had \u2013 it was not umbrella. We did notice as you recall, back in 2022, some challenges with the umbrella line, we jumped on that, working with our agents and Commercial Lines underwriting. The limits profile there has always been the vast majority of those accounts, those umbrellas. It's a low limit book profile \u2013 has probably become a little \u2013 even more low limit over the last 1.5 years as we took action, both pricing and capacity on specific segments, some specific classes of business and then some specific venues where we felt that the environment was just a little more difficult. Steve also mentioned that umbrella line was modestly profitable in 2023. And we've got a long-term profitable record with umbrella, and we look to continue to grow that. So that was, I think, your limits question. The other question you had, Michael, is on the 3-year policy. We're as committed to that 3-year policy as we ever have been. I think it resonates with policyholders and with our agents. So our desire for long-term relationships. Our 3-year policy \u2013 package policy actually outperforms a 1-year contract from an underwriting standpoint. Our underwriters use the art and science of pricing. And you can see \u2013 we can see it in the book that they \u2013 they are using it the right way, and we're getting profitable results. from the 3-year policy. You mentioned the muting effect with pricing and make a long story short, about 75% of our premium in commercial lines, even on a 3-year policy are adjusted on an annual basis. So 75% of the premiums are being adjusted annually. Again, just committed to that 3-year \u2013 and we think it's \u2013 again, it shows the marketplace that we want long-term relationships and our retentions at the first and second anniversary of a 3-year policy are about 10 points higher than we actually have a renewal. So there is an added benefit to it as well. Hopefully, the answer would be helpful. Mike could you \u2013 did you say commercial auto or personal auto? You broke up. Yes. You just broke up. I didn't hear. Yes. So again, Steve Spray. Yes, I think it is a lot of \u2013 it's blocking and tackling. It's sophisticated pricing that we on to continue to develop segmentation precision in the pricing. And as you know, I think inflation probably hit the personal auto line as hard as any line of business in P&C. And we reacted accordingly, and it's a lot of rate that is continuing to burn into that book. Yes. The only other thing I might add is, over time, our mix of business and personal lines is moving. We're growing both the middle market segment and high net worth. But over time, we think that the high net worth business, as it always has or traditionally has \u2013 will outperform the middle market space and that personal auto is a less percentage of the package with high net worth or private client than it is on the middle market. So I think mix of business is probably helping us as well. Thanks, Mike. No, I don't think it brings in any more volatility than what we would normally experience. Mike. We've always had an agency strategy. So we \u2013 we're trying to be as important to each agency that we do business with and be an important partner for all segments, whether it's small like the box you mentioned, middle markets or larger accounts. We've always written small business. We've always written larger accounts. That small business, a lot of times, is more of a technology play. And we have \u2013 we have launched just an excellent platform, not because I say so, but because our agency feedback is telling us that it's intuitive and it's easy. So I expect that you will see us continue to make big strides in the small business area. And then on the, what we call, key accounts, larger accounts, commercially, we have added a lot of expertise in that area, and we are growing it \u2013 we were growing it in a conservative manner and very \u2013 underwriting profit first, but our runway on larger accounts and keep moving, I guess upstream as one might say is, I think is very positive too. I would \u2013 this is Steve Spray, Greg. Let me start with Commercial Lines. We use the same predictive modeling tools and have our field underwriters use the art of underwriting and balance that. And if you recall, we started off 2023. New business was, we were under some pressure for new business. We were keeping our pricing discipline going there. And as the year progressed, I would like to say we kind of saw the market come our way. And new businesses continue to get better and better throughout the year in \u201823 and again, kept that pricing and underwriting discipline. Personal Lines, the new business there and the net written premium growth has just been strong throughout the year. And I just think we are in such a good position going forward in Personal Lines as well, because we are \u2013 like I have said earlier, we have an agency strategy, and we have become a premier market, both in middle market and high net worth for our agencies, and they tell us that regularly. And with our $12 billion of GAAP equity supported $8 billion of premium. We are in a good position with our balance sheet to continue to grow Personal Lines. Through this, I will call it tumultuous market. So, feel really good about that. On the E&S side, 90.6% combined ratio are better now for 11 years in a row. It's about 90% casualty. The submission counts there continue to be strong. You can see that the new business throughout 2023 was strong and I don't see any reason why that will continue into 2024 as well. Jack, this is Steve Spray. We \u2013 I will say, on the property cat treaty, we buy that for balance sheet protection. As last \u2013 if you recall, last year, we increased our retention on the property cap from $100 million to $200 million. We renewed it for \u201824 with that same $200 million retention. And we also then bought another $100 million on top. So, now the total program is $1.2 billion. We obviously balance the cost of that with what we are trying to do on the loss ratio, but again, always keeping in mind that it's for balance sheet protection, not earnings. I would also note that in that $1.2 billion tower that we have for the property cat, we also filled out some more of the \u2013 we will call it, maybe the middle layers this year than what we did for the 2023 year. So, no guidance on loss ratio for you on that, but just maybe a little background or color on the property cat treaty."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income was a significant part of higher net income and improved operating results, up 15% for the fourth quarter and 14% for full year 2023 compared with the same periods of last year. Dividend income was up 7% for the quarter largely due to a special dividend from one of our stock holdings. On a full year 2023 basis, we added to the equity portfolio with net purchases totaling $14 million. Bond interest income, again, grew at a good pace, up 19% for the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to add fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $1.4 billion for full year 2023. The fourth quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.48% and for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 32 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during 2023 was 6.13%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. Before tax effects, the net gain was $1.50 billion for the equity portfolio and $621 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of 2023, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.1 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $570 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income as did rising bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for full year 2023 was just over $2 billion matching last year. Regarding expense management, we always intend to strive to an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. Our full year 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio at 30.0% was in line with 2022. While the fourth quarter ratio was 1.3 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to higher profit sharing commissions for agencies and associate related expenses. Next, I will summarize loss reserve activity. Our approach remains consistent and aim for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. Our quarterly study of updated paid and case reserve loss and loss expense data for our commercial casualty line of business considered how fourth quarter incurred amounts were higher than we expected, especially for the general liability coverages for older accident years. To reflect the continued uncertainty of ultimate losses and loss expenses, we increased our estimates for several prior accident years to levels more likely to be adequate. The net amount of the fourth quarter increase was $51 million, including $29 million for accident years prior to 2019. Commercial casualty unfavorable reserve development on a full year 2023 basis was fairly small at $15 million. Only 0.5% of the year-end 2022 reserve balance. Prior accident year reserve development for commercial umbrella during 2023 and was a favorable $6 million. During 2023, our net addition to total property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $682 million, including $634 million for the IBNR portion. For full year 2023, we experienced $215 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.8 percentage points, marking 35 consecutive years of net favorable development on prior accident year loss and loss expense reserves. On an online basis by accident year, net reserve development for full year 2023 included a favorable $137 million for 2022, favorable $21 million for 2021, favorable $68 million for 2020 and an unfavorable $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. I'll conclude with a few capital management highlights. Another area where our approach includes careful consideration of the long-term. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not repurchase any shares. Our view of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both remain in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at year-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital continue to be under 10%. And our year-end 2023 book value of $77.06 per share means the $12.1 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity provides plenty of opportunity for profitable growth by supporting $8.1 billion of annual property casualty net written premiums. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Yes. Thank you for the question. This is Mike Sewell. I think we have kind of really said over the last couple of years that we have been targeting a 30% expense ratio. And so we are still looking at that. We are shooting for that. And we are actually there for the last 2 years. So, I am kind of setting my sights. And we are not going to give up. We are going to keep investing where we need to invest, keep controlling costs where we think we can control it better. And any time that we can get that below 30%, we are going to try to do that. So, I am targeting for below 30%, but I am happy where it is, but we can always improve. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters we discuss today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteven Johnston: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We are pleased with our operating performance in the third quarter as we again saw improved underwriting ratios for almost every major line of business compared with the first half of this year. The net loss of $99 million for the third quarter of 2023 included recognition of $362 million on an after-tax basis for the reduction of fair value of equity securities still held. We continue to believe the value of our equity portfolio will increase over the long term. As of September 30, it had $5.6 billion in appreciated value. It decreased 8% during the third quarter but has increased 2% since the end of last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $261 million for the third quarter more than doubled last year's $116 million, including a decrease of catastrophe losses of $58 million on an after-tax basis. The 94.4% third quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 9.5 percentage points better than the third quarter of last year, including a decrease of 4.8 points for catastrophe losses. Our 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios are also better than '22, improving 3.4 percentage points for the third quarter and 1.7 points on a 9-month basis. Similar to last quarter, we also see signs of positive momentum in operating performance. Pricing segmentation by risk and significant average price increases contributed to the increase in our underlying profit combined with risk selection and other efforts to address elevated inflation effects on incurred losses. On a current accident year basis, measured at September 30, before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.3 percentage points on a case incurred basis. For the same time period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 3.0 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. Agencies appointed by Cincinnati Insurance are producing profitable business for us, working with associates who provide outstanding service to agents and their clients. Our underwriters are working diligently to retain profitable accounts while managing loans that we determine have inadequate pricing. They are also careful in selecting risks and pricing new business policies. Estimated average renewal price increases for the third quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines segment again averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the third quarter included auto rising to the low double-digit range and homeowner rising to the lower end of the high single-digit range. We reported 12% growth in consolidated property casualty net written premiums for the quarter. That included an 11% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums, reflecting higher levels of insured exposures in addition to price increases. Considering operating performance by insurance segment, I'll comment on premium growth and how profitability is improving compared to a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 5% in the third quarter, reflecting pricing discipline. For example, lower written premiums this year for workers' compensation and commercial umbrella together reduced the third quarter 2023 growth rate for total Commercial Lines by 2 percentage points. The Commercial Lines combined ratio improved by 3.8 percentage points despite an increase of 2.2 points from higher catastrophe losses. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 29% with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for our agencies high net worth clients. The combined ratio was 4.6 percentage points better than last year, including 2.0 points for lower catastrophe losses. Excess and Surplus Lines improved its combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points and continue to grow profitably with net written premiums up 6%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, again enhanced our overall combined ratio and continue to demonstrate risk diversification benefits. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the third quarter of 2023 was an excellent 81.0% with net written premiums essentially matching last year's third quarter. Casualty premiums again decreased as we saw fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market. Property premiums increased 24%, largely due to higher pricing while specialty premiums increased 31% due to attractive opportunities in pricing. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was an excellent 79.5% while reporting strong growth with net written premiums up 21%. Our life insurance subsidiary again performed well, with third quarter 2023 net income up 9% and term life insurance earned premiums growing 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. While our VCR on a 9-month basis is 4.4%, our third quarter 2023 VCR was negative 2.6%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed positive 2.4%, lower valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed negative 5.0%. Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add his commentary about our financial performance.\nMichael Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income again contributed nicely to improved operating results, growing 17% for the third quarter 2023 compared with the third quarter of 2022. Dividend income was up 5% for the quarter, in part due to net equity security purchases for the first 9 months of 2023, that totaled $89 million. Bond interest income continued to show strong growth, up 19% for the third quarter of this year. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling just over $1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The third quarter pretax average yield of 4.44% for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 36 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter for 2023 was 6.4%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the third quarter of 2023 were unfavorable for both our equity and bond portfolios. Before tax effects, the net loss was $463 million for the equity portfolio and $369 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.4 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.6 billion while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $1.2 billion. Cash flow continued to boost investment income, adding to the benefit of rising bond yields, cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2023 was nearly $1.5 billion, up $54 million from a year ago. We always strive for our expense management efforts to strike an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The third quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to an increase in associate and travel-related expenses. On a 9-month basis, it was 0.4 points lower. Moving on to loss reserves. Our approach consistently aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and an updated estimated ultimate losses and losses expenses by accident year in line of business. For the first 3 quarters of 2023, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $655 million, including $539 million for the IBNR portion. During the third quarter, we experienced $53 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.7 percentage points. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of 2023 included favorable $123 million for 2022, $7 million for 2021, $72 million for 2020 and $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. In terms of capital management, we also have a consistent long-term approach. During the third quarter of 2023, we paid $115 million in dividends to shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares. Our assessment of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both are in excellent condition. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.56. Life insurance operations increased book value, $0.73. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $1.04. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $1.86. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $2.33. And, we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $2.61 per share during the third quarter to $67.72 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteven Johnston: Thanks, Mike. I'm proud of the way our associates continue to help the independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance navigate this challenging market. We're sticking to our fundamentals, listening, offering solutions and building strong relationships. Because our field associates live in the communities our agents serve, we see and respond quickly to market pressures most impacting them. We are then able to find solutions that contribute to our agent success, leading to long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Gary, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: Can we start off with -- in your press release, you've talked about the 193 new agent appointments this year. How long does it take them once they've been pointed to get up to some minimum levels of premium on a per agent basis? Or put it another way, what's sort of the production targets you have in mind when you appoint the new agents. And can you just clarify the comments of the agents that are just doing Personal Lines only?\nStephen Spray: Yes, Greg, this is Steve Spray. It really depends agency by agency. One thing I think as a company, we've always prided ourselves on as we do business with the best independent agents out there. And we are very deliberate about the agencies we appoint. We spend a lot of time kind of making sure that it's a fit for both us and the agency. So when we go into a relationship, we feel pretty confident that we're aligned and that the future will bear fruit. It just depends on the size of the agency, maybe the state and community but over time, we are the #1 or #2 carrier as measured by premium volume in the majority of the agencies we do business with for at least 5 years or more. So that gives you a little -- just a little flavor of the trajectory that we have. And so it just depends but we don't want to be just in consequential -- inconsequential player in any agency.\nCharles Peters: And the percentage of -- I think you called out in the press release, a chunk of those were Personal Lines only. Was that geographically focused? Or can you add some color on that?\nStephen Spray: Yes, sure, Greg. Sorry, you asked that. Typically, Personal Lines only agencies will be private client or high net worth focused agencies to where maybe as an example, let's say, in the state of California, we're not active there for Commercial Lines right now. So if we make an agency appointment in California would be Personal Lines only, and it would be high net worth or private client-focused.\nCharles Peters: Got it. All right. I guess pivoting to the commercial lines side of the business. If we look at new business trends in your commercial, it's kind of flattish the last couple of quarters. And by the way, we've heard some other carriers talk about pockets of increased competition. Maybe you can give us some perspective inside your book of commercial, where you're seeing some headwinds from competition and where you're seeing some opportunities?\nStephen Spray: Yes. Again, Steve Spray, Greg. It's that new business that you're pointing to is all around underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation and just discipline from our field underwriters on the pricing front. So it's a very competitive -- it's always a competitive market, and it varies by state. It varies by territory on who we're competing with. But we have just -- over the years, our proven model, appointing the best agents, assigning field associates to those agencies, making decisions locally, that has served us really well over the long fall. In the last 10 years, the pricing precision, the pricing segmentation, the tools that we have, have really been what's driving quite frankly, the profitability that you see that we're producing and our new business underwriters working with our agents out in the field are executing on that disciplined strategy. And it's to put pressure candidly, it's put some pressure on the new business this year. But I can tell you each quarter of this year, is that commercial market has gotten a little more disrupted, we are seeing more and more opportunities at the underwriting terms, conditions, quality and pricing that we feel are adequate.\nCharles Peters: Okay. And then I guess the final question would be on Personal Lines because if we look at your results for the quarter, actually, you're doing pretty well in the context of how the rest of the market is performing. And you're also reporting some substantial growth in new business written. So -- maybe give us sort of an updated view on the trends you're seeing inside your Personal Lines business. And I'm thinking about auto and property, clearly. So if you could separate the 2, that would be great.\nStephen Spray: Sure. First of all, I might comment -- just we're pleased and encouraged by the improvement in ex-cat. Actually the core loss ratio that we're seeing in Personal Lines as well, certainly had some pressure with inflation and with increased cat levels, but feel like we are -- I shouldn't say feel like, we're confident that we're getting the rate on a prospective go-forward basis that's adequate. The fact that about 55% of our Personal Lines today would be what we call private client, 45% roughly middle market. We think that is a key for us with our agency model in the marketplace. That we can be a go-to care for our agents on -- regardless of the size of the home. And the way we handle claims locally fast [indiscernible] with empathy, we think, puts us in a really good position going forward on all Personal Lines. Yes, it's -- the loss ratio has been -- has certainly been under pressure with inflation and the increased cat activity, but we're confident in where it's headed going forward. We see a lot of opportunity out there. A lot of disruption in that Personal Lines market. Candidly, I've never seen a harder market than the Personal Lines market we're seeing today. And we think with our balance sheet, our agency strategy, the way we're approaching it, the expertise, the pricing precision, we think it's going to bode well for us in the future to grow that Personal Lines book.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO.\nMichael Zaremski: I guess maybe going back to kind of the topic of growth and risk selection. And maybe just sticking with Commercial Lines. So if I kind of just step back, Cincinnati Financial's pricing power levels are fairly similar to a number of your peers yet your growth rate, just overall growth rate is much lower than your historical growth rate relative to the industry, which you've been talking about this about changing your appetite a bit and every quarter, this isn't like a surprise. But just kind of then curious like, are -- I would have thought, it doesn't seem like you're losing business because of pricing because your pricing levels are similar to peers. So is it -- or maybe I'm wrong and in just certain lines, actually, you're actually -- we're looking at all-in rate and certain lines, you actually are casualty raising a lot more than the average. Or is the -- has your fundamental risk selection process change that you're just not willing to take on certain risks or you're trying to shed certain risks and kind of just kind of see where we are in this kind of journey to whether the -- your historical growth rate will get back to what it used to be historically relative to the industry if your appetite decides to change.\nStephen Spray: Yes. Mike, Steve Spray again. Steve Johnston commented in his opening remarks on the net written premium piece of Commercial as I might start there in that we've got a 2 full point drag on Commercial Lines from workers' compensation and umbrella or excess you could call it, both for different reasons. We're comp about 1 point drag, that has been going on now for several years. Just simply, the rate decreases that are being pushed through really for the industry. On umbrella, that is deliberate. It started probably a little over a year ago here in Commercial Lines. In certain jurisdictions, certain states, we really took aggressive, appropriate underwriting action on our umbrella book, reducing limits, maybe shedding some of that business. So that's putting a weight on the Commercial Lines growth as well. So your comment of returning to historical levels or walking away from other business, like I was saying before, I think we've got a winning strategy. We've got a winning model, doing business locally with the best agents in the business, face-to-face that has served us well for many, many years. And our risk selection, our claims handling, our loss control, those things have all improved on linear basis since I've been here, I think, 32 years ago. Our pricing precision, segmentation has improved exponentially over the last 10 years. So where we just didn't have those tools, say, when I was a field rep 15 years ago and the look into each individual account that we do and price them on their own merits. So yes, our field underwriters and our renewal underwriters have those pricing precision tools that they use to where -- if we don't feel like we can get an adequate rate on a risk-adjusted basis, we're -- we'll walk away from an account, and we'll wait it out. First and foremost is we need an underwriting profit. We've got 11.5 years in a row now of -- 11 years and 9 months of underwriting profit and we want to keep that rolling. I don't worry about growth over the long haul at Cincinnati Insurance Company. We are talking about agency appointments. We have plenty of runway to continue to do that. We're growing our E&S company. You see what's going on in Personal Lines. Well, I'm not -- I don't worry about growth prospects for the future.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's thorough and helpful answer. And my follow-up is you've been deliberate in your actions to kind of increase IBNR. And you've talked about uncertainty in terms of -- more uncertainty in terms of the loss cost trend environment. Growth is obviously -- you just talked about maybe a little bit slower, too. So would it be fair to characterize that Cincinnati is taking a view that loss cost trend is a bit higher on a go-forward basis than it has been a year or 2 ago. Is that a fair characterization?\nSteven Johnston: Greg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think what we've seen was kind of a rapid acceleration of inflation starting at the beginning of 2021. It is now in the last several months moderated, still going up, but moderated. I think just with the way that we time our rate increases in rolling on to the book, it takes a little while for them to actually reach all the policyholders. But the key point, I think, is that we are very prospective in terms of the way we look at inflation. The most important thing we can do is to look out into the prospective policy periods that we're pricing for right now, do our best to estimate the loss costs and the inflation impact on that prospective period and set the pricing right and do it on a individual policy-by-policy basis the best we can. And I think we're in a good position to continue doing that.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. So you clearly feel it sounds like pricing is in excess of loss trend, knock on wood, if everything plays out. If you don't agree with that...\nSteven Johnston: I would agree with that.\nOperator: The next question is from Grace Carter with Bank of America.\nGrace Carter: Looking at kind of results line by line in the Commercial segment, it seemed like quite a few saw year-over-year improvement but the workers' compensation line sticks out a little bit kind of the second quarter in a row where we've seen a decent bit of pressure on the underlying loss ratio. I was just curious if we could get more color on what's going on there. I mean, obviously, you'll have referenced the pricing pressure for that book. But we've also heard some other peers talk about concerns regarding medical inflation. And if you all could just give us some more color on what's happening there?\nStephen Spray: Yes, Grace, Steve Spray. Thanks for the question. The accident year combined ratio, loss ratio for work comp is, yes, it's under pressure. Calendar year is still performing quite well. The -- it is -- I hate to keep telling the same story, but it really is simply just pressure -- downward pressure on the rates that are put out by the rating bureaus. And fortunately, I think for Cincinnati Insurance company is we've always been conservative on the workers' compensation line. We've got tremendous expertise, we're ready to grow that business when we think that the pricing is at an attractive level. But right now, it's -- again, we're doing it risk by risk, and we are running new workers' compensation business. But just -- it's a line that, as you mentioned, medical inflation can impact it over time. I can't see that we're seeing anything out of the ordinary with the medical inflation at this point. But that line of business is definitely under pressure on an accident year basis and primarily from just rate pressure.\nGrace Carter: And I guess on Cincinnati Re, you all mentioned kind of reducing casualty premiums in that book for a couple of quarters now. And we've also heard some more players in the market start talking about concerns over casualty loss cost trends here lately. I was just curious if you think if there's anything particularly new going on in casualty reinsurance or if the recent comments are surprising to you all at all? Or -- and I guess, next year, just if you think opportunities from property, specialty, et cetera, will outweigh any sort of ongoing pressure on the casualty piece of that book to allow it to inflect back to growth?\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Grace. Really good question. And I think it boils down to our model at Cincinnati Re and that we didn't really actually form a company Cincinnati Re. It writes on Cincinnati Insurance paper. So there's the A+ quality there. And then it's an allocated capital model. So what we try to do is just look at every contract as it comes up. We don't try to do things this much in property, this much in casualty this much in specialty. Just look at each contract that becomes available to us on its own merits and if we can get the target hurdle rate that we're looking for and feel good about how it fits into our overall risk model, we'll go ahead and write that. So I would think that we will see movements in the various business lines that reflect that. I think right now, just what we're seeing is certain lines like professional liability, transactional liability and so forth are areas where we felt that the pricing and sometimes the opportunity or not is as good as they've been in the past, where we are seeing really good opportunity in the property and specialty lines. So we'll just go at that contract by contract and very bullish with everything that Cincinnati Re is bringing to us in terms of profitability and diversification.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Two questions on Personal Lines. First, is there any appreciable difference in the profitability of private clients and middle market?\nStephen Spray: Meyer, Steve Spray. We don't -- right now, we are disclosing the difference in loss ratios for our specific book between middle market and high net worth or private client. But I can tell you, over the long pull, the industry, private client has outperformed middle market by a pretty good margin. And we feel like we can create those same results over time as well. Not that we want to subsidize middle market. The middle market book needs to stand on its own. We've got the pricing precision there. Again, we've got the agency force. So we expect both segments to be profitable. But we do think, over the long pull, the high net worth of private client will outperform.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. I completely understood. Second question, a couple of companies have talked about moderating rent cost inflation, specifically for auto physical damage. And I was wondering whether you're seeing that in the third quarter as well?\nSteven Johnston: We have seen it in just certain areas within physical damage. As we look at replacement vehicles, rental cars, that sort of thing. But again, we're still kind of looking at inflation on a -- how it's been cumulatively since 2021 as we use that data to forecast the loss cost and the premium needed in the prospective periods. And so we're being cautious, I think, in terms of where we are with our inflation rates, but we do feel that we're getting ahead of our loss cost trends. We are ahead of our loss cost trends with our pricing. And I think we benefited that while we had a stay-at-home credit during 2020. We did not actually -- we bring that through the expense ratio. We did not actually decrease the auto rates. And I think that's helping us now as we contemplate inflation and our pricing.\nOperator: The next question is from Fred Nelson, a Private Investor.\nUnidentified Analyst: I got a call last night from a lady pushing 90, thanking me for Cincinnati Financial and I told her that I would refer that today on the phone on the conference call, and she didn't even know you had one. But the question is battery-operated vehicles of all types, has that changed the pricing of insurance, replacement costs and accidents? Do you have any comments you can share?\nSteven Johnston: Yes. Fred, this is Steve Johnston. I think what we just have to do is make sure that we contemplate the costs involved. As we go to having more electronic vehicles in the fleet, there will be more of that cost in the battery. They are less complex, I believe, in terms of all the different parts that are involved. So it is different. It will create a challenge to stay on top of -- as we calculate those costs in price, but we feel that we're up to the task. And please thank your friend to call us. We appreciate your comments.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, thank you. The battery operated calls I have people in the farming business with pickup trucks and other machinery and they say it's not an easy thing to work with. And they'll ask the question about insurance soon so thank you for the best you do. I really appreciate it.\nSteven Johnston: Well, thank you, Fred. It's always good to hear from you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.\nSteven Johnston: Thank you, Gary, and thank you to all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Investment income again contributed nicely to improved operating results, growing 17% for the third quarter 2023 compared with the third quarter of 2022. Dividend income was up 5% for the quarter, in part due to net equity security purchases for the first 9 months of 2023, that totaled $89 million. Bond interest income continued to show strong growth, up 19% for the third quarter of this year. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling just over $1 billion for the first 9 months of the year. The third quarter pretax average yield of 4.44% for the fixed maturity portfolio rose 36 basis points compared with last year. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter for 2023 was 6.4%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the third quarter of 2023 were unfavorable for both our equity and bond portfolios. Before tax effects, the net loss was $463 million for the equity portfolio and $369 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $4.4 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.6 billion while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $1.2 billion. Cash flow continued to boost investment income, adding to the benefit of rising bond yields, cash flow from operating activities for the first 9 months of 2023 was nearly $1.5 billion, up $54 million from a year ago. We always strive for our expense management efforts to strike an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The third quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.6 percentage points higher than last year, primarily due to an increase in associate and travel-related expenses. On a 9-month basis, it was 0.4 points lower. Moving on to loss reserves. Our approach consistently aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and an updated estimated ultimate losses and losses expenses by accident year in line of business. For the first 3 quarters of 2023, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $655 million, including $539 million for the IBNR portion. During the third quarter, we experienced $53 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.7 percentage points. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 9 months of 2023 included favorable $123 million for 2022, $7 million for 2021, $72 million for 2020 and $11 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. In terms of capital management, we also have a consistent long-term approach. During the third quarter of 2023, we paid $115 million in dividends to shareholders. We did not repurchase any shares. Our assessment of our financial flexibility and our financial strength is that both are in excellent condition. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of third quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.56. Life insurance operations increased book value, $0.73. Investment income, other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $1.04. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $1.86. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio decreased book value by $2.33. And, we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value decrease of $2.61 per share during the third quarter to $67.72 per share. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve."

            "name": "Stephen Spray",
            "content": "Yes, Greg, this is Steve Spray. It really depends agency by agency. One thing I think as a company, we've always prided ourselves on as we do business with the best independent agents out there. And we are very deliberate about the agencies we appoint. We spend a lot of time kind of making sure that it's a fit for both us and the agency. So when we go into a relationship, we feel pretty confident that we're aligned and that the future will bear fruit. It just depends on the size of the agency, maybe the state and community but over time, we are the #1 or #2 carrier as measured by premium volume in the majority of the agencies we do business with for at least 5 years or more. So that gives you a little -- just a little flavor of the trajectory that we have. And so it just depends but we don't want to be just in consequential -- inconsequential player in any agency. Yes, sure, Greg. Sorry, you asked that. Typically, Personal Lines only agencies will be private client or high net worth focused agencies to where maybe as an example, let's say, in the state of California, we're not active there for Commercial Lines right now. So if we make an agency appointment in California would be Personal Lines only, and it would be high net worth or private client-focused. Yes. Again, Steve Spray, Greg. It's that new business that you're pointing to is all around underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation and just discipline from our field underwriters on the pricing front. So it's a very competitive -- it's always a competitive market, and it varies by state. It varies by territory on who we're competing with. But we have just -- over the years, our proven model, appointing the best agents, assigning field associates to those agencies, making decisions locally, that has served us really well over the long fall. In the last 10 years, the pricing precision, the pricing segmentation, the tools that we have, have really been what's driving quite frankly, the profitability that you see that we're producing and our new business underwriters working with our agents out in the field are executing on that disciplined strategy. And it's to put pressure candidly, it's put some pressure on the new business this year. But I can tell you each quarter of this year, is that commercial market has gotten a little more disrupted, we are seeing more and more opportunities at the underwriting terms, conditions, quality and pricing that we feel are adequate. Sure. First of all, I might comment -- just we're pleased and encouraged by the improvement in ex-cat. Actually the core loss ratio that we're seeing in Personal Lines as well, certainly had some pressure with inflation and with increased cat levels, but feel like we are -- I shouldn't say feel like, we're confident that we're getting the rate on a prospective go-forward basis that's adequate. The fact that about 55% of our Personal Lines today would be what we call private client, 45% roughly middle market. We think that is a key for us with our agency model in the marketplace. That we can be a go-to care for our agents on -- regardless of the size of the home. And the way we handle claims locally fast [indiscernible] with empathy, we think, puts us in a really good position going forward on all Personal Lines. Yes, it's -- the loss ratio has been -- has certainly been under pressure with inflation and the increased cat activity, but we're confident in where it's headed going forward. We see a lot of opportunity out there. A lot of disruption in that Personal Lines market. Candidly, I've never seen a harder market than the Personal Lines market we're seeing today. And we think with our balance sheet, our agency strategy, the way we're approaching it, the expertise, the pricing precision, we think it's going to bode well for us in the future to grow that Personal Lines book. Yes. Mike, Steve Spray again. Steve Johnston commented in his opening remarks on the net written premium piece of Commercial as I might start there in that we've got a 2 full point drag on Commercial Lines from workers' compensation and umbrella or excess you could call it, both for different reasons. We're comp about 1 point drag, that has been going on now for several years. Just simply, the rate decreases that are being pushed through really for the industry. On umbrella, that is deliberate. It started probably a little over a year ago here in Commercial Lines. In certain jurisdictions, certain states, we really took aggressive, appropriate underwriting action on our umbrella book, reducing limits, maybe shedding some of that business. So that's putting a weight on the Commercial Lines growth as well. So your comment of returning to historical levels or walking away from other business, like I was saying before, I think we've got a winning strategy. We've got a winning model, doing business locally with the best agents in the business, face-to-face that has served us well for many, many years. And our risk selection, our claims handling, our loss control, those things have all improved on linear basis since I've been here, I think, 32 years ago. Our pricing precision, segmentation has improved exponentially over the last 10 years. So where we just didn't have those tools, say, when I was a field rep 15 years ago and the look into each individual account that we do and price them on their own merits. So yes, our field underwriters and our renewal underwriters have those pricing precision tools that they use to where -- if we don't feel like we can get an adequate rate on a risk-adjusted basis, we're -- we'll walk away from an account, and we'll wait it out. First and foremost is we need an underwriting profit. We've got 11.5 years in a row now of -- 11 years and 9 months of underwriting profit and we want to keep that rolling. I don't worry about growth over the long haul at Cincinnati Insurance Company. We are talking about agency appointments. We have plenty of runway to continue to do that. We're growing our E&S company. You see what's going on in Personal Lines. Well, I'm not -- I don't worry about growth prospects for the future. Yes, Grace, Steve Spray. Thanks for the question. The accident year combined ratio, loss ratio for work comp is, yes, it's under pressure. Calendar year is still performing quite well. The -- it is -- I hate to keep telling the same story, but it really is simply just pressure -- downward pressure on the rates that are put out by the rating bureaus. And fortunately, I think for Cincinnati Insurance company is we've always been conservative on the workers' compensation line. We've got tremendous expertise, we're ready to grow that business when we think that the pricing is at an attractive level. But right now, it's -- again, we're doing it risk by risk, and we are running new workers' compensation business. But just -- it's a line that, as you mentioned, medical inflation can impact it over time. I can't see that we're seeing anything out of the ordinary with the medical inflation at this point. But that line of business is definitely under pressure on an accident year basis and primarily from just rate pressure. Meyer, Steve Spray. We don't -- right now, we are disclosing the difference in loss ratios for our specific book between middle market and high net worth or private client. But I can tell you, over the long pull, the industry, private client has outperformed middle market by a pretty good margin. And we feel like we can create those same results over time as well. Not that we want to subsidize middle market. The middle market book needs to stand on its own. We've got the pricing precision there. Again, we've got the agency force. So we expect both segments to be profitable. But we do think, over the long pull, the high net worth of private client will outperform."

            "name": "Steven Johnston",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We are pleased with our operating performance in the third quarter as we again saw improved underwriting ratios for almost every major line of business compared with the first half of this year. The net loss of $99 million for the third quarter of 2023 included recognition of $362 million on an after-tax basis for the reduction of fair value of equity securities still held. We continue to believe the value of our equity portfolio will increase over the long term. As of September 30, it had $5.6 billion in appreciated value. It decreased 8% during the third quarter but has increased 2% since the end of last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $261 million for the third quarter more than doubled last year's $116 million, including a decrease of catastrophe losses of $58 million on an after-tax basis. The 94.4% third quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 9.5 percentage points better than the third quarter of last year, including a decrease of 4.8 points for catastrophe losses. Our 2023 ex-cat accident year combined ratios are also better than '22, improving 3.4 percentage points for the third quarter and 1.7 points on a 9-month basis. Similar to last quarter, we also see signs of positive momentum in operating performance. Pricing segmentation by risk and significant average price increases contributed to the increase in our underlying profit combined with risk selection and other efforts to address elevated inflation effects on incurred losses. On a current accident year basis, measured at September 30, before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.3 percentage points on a case incurred basis. For the same time period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 3.0 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses, remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. Agencies appointed by Cincinnati Insurance are producing profitable business for us, working with associates who provide outstanding service to agents and their clients. Our underwriters are working diligently to retain profitable accounts while managing loans that we determine have inadequate pricing. They are also careful in selecting risks and pricing new business policies. Estimated average renewal price increases for the third quarter continued at a healthy pace. Our Commercial Lines segment again averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment continued in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the third quarter included auto rising to the low double-digit range and homeowner rising to the lower end of the high single-digit range. We reported 12% growth in consolidated property casualty net written premiums for the quarter. That included an 11% increase in third quarter renewal written premiums, reflecting higher levels of insured exposures in addition to price increases. Considering operating performance by insurance segment, I'll comment on premium growth and how profitability is improving compared to a year ago. Commercial Lines grew net written premiums 5% in the third quarter, reflecting pricing discipline. For example, lower written premiums this year for workers' compensation and commercial umbrella together reduced the third quarter 2023 growth rate for total Commercial Lines by 2 percentage points. The Commercial Lines combined ratio improved by 3.8 percentage points despite an increase of 2.2 points from higher catastrophe losses. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 29% with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for our agencies high net worth clients. The combined ratio was 4.6 percentage points better than last year, including 2.0 points for lower catastrophe losses. Excess and Surplus Lines improved its combined ratio by 3.4 percentage points and continue to grow profitably with net written premiums up 6%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, again enhanced our overall combined ratio and continue to demonstrate risk diversification benefits. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the third quarter of 2023 was an excellent 81.0% with net written premiums essentially matching last year's third quarter. Casualty premiums again decreased as we saw fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market. Property premiums increased 24%, largely due to higher pricing while specialty premiums increased 31% due to attractive opportunities in pricing. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was an excellent 79.5% while reporting strong growth with net written premiums up 21%. Our life insurance subsidiary again performed well, with third quarter 2023 net income up 9% and term life insurance earned premiums growing 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. While our VCR on a 9-month basis is 4.4%, our third quarter 2023 VCR was negative 2.6%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed positive 2.4%, lower valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed negative 5.0%. Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add his commentary about our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. I'm proud of the way our associates continue to help the independent agents who represent Cincinnati Insurance navigate this challenging market. We're sticking to our fundamentals, listening, offering solutions and building strong relationships. Because our field associates live in the communities our agents serve, we see and respond quickly to market pressures most impacting them. We are then able to find solutions that contribute to our agent success, leading to long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Gary, please open the call for questions. Greg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think what we've seen was kind of a rapid acceleration of inflation starting at the beginning of 2021. It is now in the last several months moderated, still going up, but moderated. I think just with the way that we time our rate increases in rolling on to the book, it takes a little while for them to actually reach all the policyholders. But the key point, I think, is that we are very prospective in terms of the way we look at inflation. The most important thing we can do is to look out into the prospective policy periods that we're pricing for right now, do our best to estimate the loss costs and the inflation impact on that prospective period and set the pricing right and do it on a individual policy-by-policy basis the best we can. And I think we're in a good position to continue doing that. I would agree with that. Thank you, Grace. Really good question. And I think it boils down to our model at Cincinnati Re and that we didn't really actually form a company Cincinnati Re. It writes on Cincinnati Insurance paper. So there's the A+ quality there. And then it's an allocated capital model. So what we try to do is just look at every contract as it comes up.

We are ahead of our loss cost trends with our pricing. And I think we benefited that while we had a stay-at-home credit during 2020. We did not actually -- we bring that through the expense ratio. We did not actually decrease the auto rates. And I think that's helping us now as we contemplate inflation and our pricing. Yes. Fred, this is Steve Johnston. I think what we just have to do is make sure that we contemplate the costs involved. As we go to having more electronic vehicles in the fleet, there will be more of that cost in the battery.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued the news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hopper. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2023 was quite a change from the net loss of more than $800 million for last year's second quarter. As we've noted in the past, large income swings can occur as gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value. And this year, we recognized a significant investment gain. We believe the value of our equity portfolio will continue to grow over the long term. As of June 30, it had $6.1 billion in appreciated value, increasing 8% since the end of the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income of $191 million for the quarter more than doubled the $94 million from a year ago despite catastrophe losses that were $11 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 97.6% second quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 5.6 percentage points better than last year's second quarter, including a decrease of 0.4 points for catastrophe losses. The 90.4% ex-cat accident year combined ratio for the second quarter was 2.4 percentage points better than the same period a year ago and is another important indicator of improved performance. Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and ongoing elevated inflation effects, we continue to see reasons for confidence about performance for the second half of the year. Pricing continued to accelerate during the second quarter of this year and we also worked to address inflation in other ways, such as changing factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs. We reported improved underwriting performance ratios in just about every major line of business compared with the first quarter of this year. On a current accident year basis, measured at June 30 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 and consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.5 percentage points on a case incurred basis which included 0.6 point improvement on a paid basis. For the same period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 4.7 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. Similar to the first quarter, we earned a small underwriting profit for our commercial umbrella line in the second quarter. In our commercial casualty line of business in total had an estimated combined ratio of approximately 90%. Our underwriters continue to do an excellent job in risk selection and pricing Importantly, Asians appointed by Cincinnati Insurance continue to produce profitable business for us in an outstanding fashion. Underwriters emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were higher than the first quarter for each of our major lines of business. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the second quarter included auto in the high single-digit range and homeowner in the mid-single-digit range. In terms of net written premiums, consolidated property casualty growth was 9% for the second quarter of 2023. That included an 11% increase in second quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insurance exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Next, I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. Commercial Lines grew second quarter 2023 net written premiums 3%, reflecting discipline, particularly for commercial umbrella risks. Its combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points better than a year ago, including 1.5 points from lower catastrophe losses. We see the second quarter 10% reduction in new business written premiums as an expected result of pricing and underwriting discipline. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 23%, with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for the high net worth clients and our agencies. Its combined ratio was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago despite an increase of 0.6 points from catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 92.2% and net written premiums grew 16%. Its combined ratio was 7.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 9.9 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continued to enhance our profitability. Cincinnati Re had a strong 73.7% combined ratio for the second quarter of 2023. Its net written premiums essentially matched last year's second quarter, while casualty premiums decreased as a result of fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market, property net written premiums increased by 27% and largely due to a combination of higher pricing and market opportunities. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 88.3% with net written premiums continuing strong growth at 19%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to report excellent results in the second quarter with net income up 91% from last year in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%. As I usually do, I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our second quarter 2023 VCR was 4.0%, another strong result. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.8%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 2.2%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other important factors about our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve and thanks for all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued at a strong pace of 13% for the second quarter of 2023 versus last year's second quarter. As expected, dividend income decreased 3% for the quarter due to 2 items we touched on last quarter. First, we are seeing dividend rates increase more slowly. Second, in last year's second quarter, we received a $5 million special dividend from 1 of our stockholdings that didn't repeat this year. Net equity security purchases for the first half of 2023 totaled $93 million. Bond interest income rose 19% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with the net purchases totaling $732 million for the first 6 months of the year. The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.34% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 34 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2023 was 5.88%. Valuation changes in aggregate for our equity portfolio during the second quarter of 2023 were favorable but were unfavorable for the bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain for the equity portfolio was $459 million, while the net loss for the bond portfolio was $158 million. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.1 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $838 million. Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth in addition to rising bond yields boosting interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2023 was $825 million, up 9% from a year ago. We continue to emphasize expense management with a balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The second quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year as premium growth outpaced growth in total expenses. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first half of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $452 million, including $358 million for the IBNR portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $101 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.5 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2023 included: favorable $99 million for 2022; unfavorable $5 million for 2021; favorable $49 million for 2020 and a favorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. Regarding capital management, our approach remains consistent as we pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe our financial flexibility is outstanding and that our financial strength is in excellent shape. During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 398,000 shares at an average price per share of $104.48. We also paid $117 million in dividends to shareholders during the quarter. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.15. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.86. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.31 and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2 per share during the second quarter to $7.33 per share. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. We are in the challenging insurance market and I'm proud of the way our associates are navigating it. We believe we are taking the necessary actions to continue delivering profitable growth through all insurance cycles. In the last month, to third-party organizations agreed. S&P affirmed our high financial strength ratings and we were also again included on the 50 list, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return. We are 1 of only 4 companies named 32 times to the Property Casualty Awards 50 since the analysis began in 1991. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Solaria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Vaishnavi, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask maybe a little detail on the source of the competition that's been hampering the new business production in commercial. Happy you many names but if you give us a sense of just kind of what kind of companies sort of products, etcetera, that keeping you more disciplined.\nSteve Spray: Paul, Steve Spray. I would reiterate kind of what Steve said there in his closing prepared remarks, just that it's a challenging market. This business, as I've said in the past, it's local. You get various competitors in different states that just have a different view of risk. I think from my perspective, it's been more about our underwriters and our field reps just continuing to execute working with our agents on disciplined pricing and underwriting. It's profit first here or segmenting the business. But from time to time, you'll see carriers that maybe have a different view of the risk. And we've just got the tools today that we didn't have in the past to be able to be disciplined about it. And just couldn't be more proud of the team, both on the new business front, our field reps and our renewal underwriters and the way they're executing. And I would add that it's a dynamic market we're seeing it change on a daily basis. And at the end of the second quarter, we did see, I would say, the market coming more to us on the pricing side and so on new business. It's 1 month of an end of a quarter, so it may not make a trend but we did see some improvement in new business towards the tail end of the second quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question, Paul.\nPaul Newsome: It's definitely getting there. Just maybe a little bit mistaking but I was kind of going through the supplement and I noticed that recent commercial business, there's a little bit less of a loss IBNR booked up in the quarter. Anything anomalous there that you want to call out on that number?\nSteve Johnston: Sure. Paul, this is Steve. And actually, on a dollar basis, our IBNR did increase. It's just our premium increased a little bit faster. And I think last year, second quarter of last year, I think we've -- I think we've seen the situation with inflation and recognize the leveraged effect of inflation on higher limits and umbrella in particular and we're strong to address that last year. So I think, again, we still had more dollars added to IBNR this quarter, just slightly less on -- as a ratio of earned premium.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: I guess, I'm going to focus on -- first question would be in the commercial casualty component of your financial supplement. And if you look at the total loss and loss expense ratio really began to show some nice improvement in the second quarter. And obviously, it's a longer tail line of business. And I'm just curious -- it seems like now with the loss ratio having improved this would be a time to perhaps start writing more of that business and yet we see it moving in the opposite direction. So maybe you could -- and I know you've provided some previous comments on it, maybe you could just give us some added context.\nSteve Johnston: Yes. Good question, Greg. And I think the 2 are kind of related. I think the improvement is a result of the discipline that we're showing in pricing and underwriting and particularly in our umbrella line of business. The other side of that is, as Steve mentioned, is we are more disciplined in the market -- it makes us a little bit harder to compete on a price basis with some others that don't have that same view of risk. So I think the 2 go together and would really just -- I can't add much to Steve's earlier response in terms of how we're handling that competitive market.\nGreg Peters: Right. I wanted to pivot just on property, whether it's inside the commercial or in the personal line space because I feel like the rate is a combination of factors, including insured to value numbers being reset. And so I'm -- when I look, for example, in your personal lines, your net written premium in homeowners up 27% in the second quarter. I'm wondering how much of that is pure rate versus actual just getting the insured to value numbers right? Or -- maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way? I don't know. It seems like a valid question though.\nSteve Spray: Yes Greg, Steve Spray. On -- specifically on commercial property and personal property and homeowner, it's about 2/3 exposure, about 1/3 rate would be a good way to look at it.\nGreg Peters: Okay, that's helpful. I guess the final question I have -- recognizing that others are going to want to ask questions would just be before you'd previously mapped out sort of an expectation for the combined ratio for the year. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that range in the context of the second quarter results as we think about the second half of the year? That's my last question.\nSteve Johnston: Greg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think we're still where we were at the -- when we first came out with it at the first quarter, we don't think it's we think it's reasonable that we would be able to be in the low to mid-90s combined ratio, 8% growth. But we have those caveats of that the weather and the market conditions are volatile and that will play out over the second half. I think the key point is we are just very confident in the movement of the ex-cat core portion of the book. It's improving nicely and that's really our focus at this point. But again, I think we're still where we were with the information that we gave in the first quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO.\nMike Zaremski: Curious, any insights into pricing power into July? And also just curious, have you guys been a bit surprised at some of the pricing power that you've experienced given the strong interest rate tailwinds that are a good guy? Or does it make sense that we're seeing kind of broader industry pricing inflect -- accelerate a bit?\nSteve Johnston: This is Steve Johnston. And it is -- it's just -- it's an execution of our business model that makes us feel good and that we are -- have great relationships with our agents. We tend to communicate and try to communicate where we are risk by risk early in the process of a renewal and just feel the execution that makes us so proud of our field people as they're out in the field, balancing discipline with being responsive to our agents' needs has boded well for us and we see it continuing to do so as we go into the second half.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. You mentioned that the -- I think in the prepared remarks, the umbrella components, of your portfolio kind of eked out a small underwriting profit. Just curious as umbrella, given kind of what you've known -- you've experienced over the last year or 2 or maybe more -- maybe it's more also just prone to social inflation. Is umbrella, are you are you kind of targeting a better combined ratio for that versus the broader segment it's in.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Over -- I think over the last '22 -- the end of '22 and prior, Mike, again, this is Steve Spray. Our combined ratio in umbrella was running around 80%. The last, like you said the last couple of years, have been challenging. It's jurisdictional. It could be state by state, it's risk by risk. And that loss ratio, like Steve said in the prepared remarks, we've been profitable here for the first half and obviously in the second quarter. We've been very deliberate about improving that line of business. And I would say, yes, we expect that loss ratio to improve from where it is today. I'll give you maybe a little bit more color on that, too. In the second quarter, our commercial umbrella net written premium was down 9 points which contributed a 2-point drag on the overall Commercial Lines net written premium. So it's been deliberate like Steve said, we got early and often with our agents to make sure that there's no surprises and work with them on pricing terms, conditions, reducing limits in some specific jurisdictions or specific risks that we think we -- that have been challenging for us.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. And Doug, maybe lastly, switching gears to Personal Lines. I think on last quarter's call, you talked about -- or maybe it wasn't a call but I think you guys have talked about you being 1 of the -- now the biggest writers in terms of new business in, for example, the state of California as others have been retrenching. Maybe you can kind of give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of kind of industry dynamics, competitive wise and personal lines and why you feel good about growing into some of these states where some competitors have had trouble kind of getting the pricing they need to keep up with loss inflation and very -- comes from the standpoint of understanding you have a very profitable personal lines book.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Steve Spray again. Yes, we feel really good and are bullish about personal lines, both on the high net worth and then the middle market business. The high net worth now or what we -- Cincinnati Private Client has become about 55% of our business. I would start with the fact that the team we have, the amount of expertise that we have selectively had joined from the outside and then the long-term associates we've had in building out that expertise not only on product but on marketing, on claims. I think we have been very well received across the country by our agents. And specifically growing it in states that you mentioned where there's been quite a bit of industry disruption. And we have definitely seen quite a bit of disruption, especially for the high net worth business. And as an example, 1 way we were able to deal with that is we were able to pivot in California as a specific example and move to writing homeowners business on an excess and surplus lines basis. And I think it goes true to Cincinnati over time as we've been able to be there for our agents and be there for the policyholders in their community provide, we think, measured capacity. We are in this high net worth business for the long term. We look at everything we do over the long term. And feel like we're positioned really well to continue to grow that business and grow it profitably. We have some work to do. Inflation has impacted the entire book but we're confident in the underwriting and especially the pricing actions we've taken to improve those results.\nOperator: The next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: A couple of quick questions, I guess. Steve, you talked about pricing accelerating pretty much every line of business sequentially. Was there any change in your internal view of trend from first quarter to second quarter?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. Meyer, this is Steve. I don't really think so. I think we are seeing -- it's very granular. We look at it by line, by state and so forth. And so you'll see some movement in directions at a very detailed level. But -- for the most part, I think we're seeing a similar view of trends first quater to second quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. I'm not 100% sure this is a good question. But when I look at the loss ratio detail, vastly higher provision for IBNR in Personal Lines than Commercial Lines. And I was wondering, is that a function of just bad weather? Or is there something else driving that?\nSteve Johnston: I think probably, Meyer, it's the growth as much as anything. There's faster growth in the Personal Line space right now.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That makes sense. And then one last question, if I can, it's a little more detailed. But have you disclosed which lines of business saw the reserve release from act year '22?\nSteve Johnston: That has not been part of our disclosure, Meyer.\nOperator: The next question comes from Grace Carter with Bank of America.\nGrace Carter: Hi, everyone. Looking at the commercial property underlying loss ratio, that experienced quite a bit of improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year. Obviously, that line can be really volatile but I was just curious the extent to which that was maybe impacted by the classification of cat versus non-cat in the quarter and pricing flowing through and just the extent to which we should extrapolate that going forward?\nSteve Spray: I can -- Grace, Steve Spray. I can take a shot at that. We have individual state plans, both for all lines -- for all lines and segments. But in Commercial Lines specifically and we -- the first thing we look at, I think, at every state is just the cat profile. We do believe you can underwrite and price for cat, you have to. And I would think terms, conditions percentage deductibles for cat. We've got the tools to understand what the -- what our average annual loss looks like. We price to that. So I think you're seeing improvement just because of the discipline that we've put both in the cat and the non-cat. I don't know if anybody else wants to add anything as far as numbers.\nSteve Johnston: I think -- you handled it quite well, Steve.\nGrace Carter: Okay. And I guess, looking at the workers' comp underlying loss ratio. That ticked up a bit versus what we're used to seeing. I was curious if there is anything kind of one-off there or if you've seen a change in loss trend or if that's just the accumulated impact of lower pricing in that line over time.\nSteve Johnston: Grace, this is Steve Johnston. I do think that just accumulation of the lower pricing over time it just does have a compounding effect. We've been very disciplined. As you can see, there have been a decrease in our writings there as we've maintained discipline over a period of time so that we feel particularly as an account underwriter that we're in a good spot overall.\nGrace Carter: And then I guess, finally, just talking about commercial casualty pretty broadly umbrella and -- I mean the underlying loss ratio there did see some improvement as well as a pretty favorable impact from reserve releases. I'm just trying to square that versus some of the commentary that we've heard over the past few quarters over being pretty cautious in that part of the business. Did you get any new information in the quarter regarding loss cost trends that gives you some more confidence regarding where that line is going? Or is this just kind of the impact of the actions that you've taken in that book over the past several quarters?\nSteve Johnston: I think your last point is what it is. It's been the action over the last several quarters and trying to get out early and start to address the inflation and the leveraged effect of inflation.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Fred Nelson [ph] of Private Investor.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Two things that are really all of you that are on the call have worked with the company needs to know that the philosophy of Cincinnati Financial of rising dividends and integrity and honesty. I cannot tell you the number of people that have told me that it's allowed them to do things in their lives with their kids, their grandkids that they never dreamed possible. And I think we're going to say thank you to all of you for that philosophy because it's really, really important in our country. The thing that I'd like to know is the number of shares outstanding at the end of the period? It says you divide the shareholders' equity for the number of shares out there to get the book value and I would appreciate if you could tell me how many shares are outstanding at the end of the period to get the book value.\nSteve Johnston: Well, thank you, Fred. This is Steve Johnston. And first off, I really want to thank you for your comments. It just really makes my day. It makes all of our days. You're talking to everybody here at the company. And we really appreciate your comments. I believe the number of shares outstanding is 158.6 million.\nUnidentified Analyst: At the end of the period?\nSteve Johnston: At the end of the period.\nUnidentified Analyst: You divide -- how many shares?\nSteve Johnston: I think it's 158.6 million.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if you divide that into the shareholder equity value of [indiscernible], did you get $70.33.\nSteve Johnston: I believe that's right.\nMike Sewell: That's right, Fred.\nSteve Johnston: I may have transposed it. I think it's 156.8 million not -- I was going from my I was going from memory and somebody slipped a piece of paper to me here. So I apologize for the transposing the shares.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate what you just said because that's the figure I got with my old math.\nSteve Johnston: Okay, good. The old math is always the best, Fred.\nUnidentified Analyst: One of my people that live with Cincinnati but incense said was TYG; thank you, God.\nSteve Johnston: Here you go. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Johnston for any closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Vaishnavi and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2023 was quite a change from the net loss of more than $800 million for last year's second quarter. As we've noted in the past, large income swings can occur as gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value. And this year, we recognized a significant investment gain. We believe the value of our equity portfolio will continue to grow over the long term. As of June 30, it had $6.1 billion in appreciated value, increasing 8% since the end of the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income of $191 million for the quarter more than doubled the $94 million from a year ago despite catastrophe losses that were $11 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 97.6% second quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 5.6 percentage points better than last year's second quarter, including a decrease of 0.4 points for catastrophe losses. The 90.4% ex-cat accident year combined ratio for the second quarter was 2.4 percentage points better than the same period a year ago and is another important indicator of improved performance. Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and ongoing elevated inflation effects, we continue to see reasons for confidence about performance for the second half of the year. Pricing continued to accelerate during the second quarter of this year and we also worked to address inflation in other ways, such as changing factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs. We reported improved underwriting performance ratios in just about every major line of business compared with the first quarter of this year. On a current accident year basis, measured at June 30 before catastrophe losses, our 2023 and consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 4.5 percentage points on a case incurred basis which included 0.6 point improvement on a paid basis. For the same period, we increased the incurred but not reported or IBNR component of the ratio by 4.7 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. Similar to the first quarter, we earned a small underwriting profit for our commercial umbrella line in the second quarter. In our commercial casualty line of business in total had an estimated combined ratio of approximately 90%. Our underwriters continue to do an excellent job in risk selection and pricing Importantly, Asians appointed by Cincinnati Insurance continue to produce profitable business for us in an outstanding fashion. Underwriters emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were higher than the first quarter for each of our major lines of business. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment averaged near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, while our excess and surplus lines insurance segment moved higher in the high single-digit range. Personal Lines for the second quarter included auto in the high single-digit range and homeowner in the mid-single-digit range. In terms of net written premiums, consolidated property casualty growth was 9% for the second quarter of 2023. That included an 11% increase in second quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insurance exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Next, I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by Insurance segment. Commercial Lines grew second quarter 2023 net written premiums 3%, reflecting discipline, particularly for commercial umbrella risks. Its combined ratio was 9.4 percentage points better than a year ago, including 1.5 points from lower catastrophe losses. We see the second quarter 10% reduction in new business written premiums as an expected result of pricing and underwriting discipline. Personal Lines grew net written premiums 23%, with growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati Private Client business for the high net worth clients and our agencies. Its combined ratio was 4.5 percentage points better than a year ago despite an increase of 0.6 points from catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines had a combined ratio of 92.2% and net written premiums grew 16%. Its combined ratio was 7.1 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 9.9 point increase in the IBNR component. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continued to enhance our profitability. Cincinnati Re had a strong 73.7% combined ratio for the second quarter of 2023. Its net written premiums essentially matched last year's second quarter, while casualty premiums decreased as a result of fewer attractive opportunities in certain segments of the market, property net written premiums increased by 27% and largely due to a combination of higher pricing and market opportunities. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 88.3% with net written premiums continuing strong growth at 19%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued to report excellent results in the second quarter with net income up 91% from last year in term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%. As I usually do, I'll conclude with the value creation ratio, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. Our second quarter 2023 VCR was 4.0%, another strong result. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.8%, while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 2.2%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will highlight other important factors about our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. We are in the challenging insurance market and I'm proud of the way our associates are navigating it. We believe we are taking the necessary actions to continue delivering profitable growth through all insurance cycles. In the last month, to third-party organizations agreed. S&P affirmed our high financial strength ratings and we were also again included on the 50 list, recognizing our growth, profitability and shareholder return. We are 1 of only 4 companies named 32 times to the Property Casualty Awards 50 since the analysis began in 1991. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Solaria, Marc Schambow and Theresa Hoffer. Vaishnavi, please open the call for questions. Sure. Paul, this is Steve. And actually, on a dollar basis, our IBNR did increase. It's just our premium increased a little bit faster. And I think last year, second quarter of last year, I think we've -- I think we've seen the situation with inflation and recognize the leveraged effect of inflation on higher limits and umbrella in particular and we're strong to address that last year. So I think, again, we still had more dollars added to IBNR this quarter, just slightly less on -- as a ratio of earned premium. Yes. Good question, Greg. And I think the 2 are kind of related. I think the improvement is a result of the discipline that we're showing in pricing and underwriting and particularly in our umbrella line of business. The other side of that is, as Steve mentioned, is we are more disciplined in the market -- it makes us a little bit harder to compete on a price basis with some others that don't have that same view of risk. So I think the 2 go together and would really just -- I can't add much to Steve's earlier response in terms of how we're handling that competitive market. Greg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think we're still where we were at the -- when we first came out with it at the first quarter, we don't think it's we think it's reasonable that we would be able to be in the low to mid-90s combined ratio, 8% growth. But we have those caveats of that the weather and the market conditions are volatile and that will play out over the second half. I think the key point is we are just very confident in the movement of the ex-cat core portion of the book. It's improving nicely and that's really our focus at this point. But again, I think we're still where we were with the information that we gave in the first quarter. This is Steve Johnston. And it is -- it's just -- it's an execution of our business model that makes us feel good and that we are -- have great relationships with our agents.

Yes. Meyer, this is Steve. I don't really think so. I think we are seeing -- it's very granular. We look at it by line, by state and so forth. And so you'll see some movement in directions at a very detailed level. But -- for the most part, I think we're seeing a similar view of trends first quater to second quarter. I think probably, Meyer, it's the growth as much as anything. There's faster growth in the Personal Line space right now. That has not been part of our disclosure, Meyer. I think -- you handled it quite well, Steve. Grace, this is Steve Johnston. I do think that just accumulation of the lower pricing over time it just does have a compounding effect. We've been very disciplined. As you can see, there have been a decrease in our writings there as we've maintained discipline over a period of time so that we feel particularly as an account underwriter that we're in a good spot overall. I think your last point is what it is. It's been the action over the last several quarters and trying to get out early and start to address the inflation and the leveraged effect of inflation. Well, thank you, Fred. This is Steve Johnston. And first off, I really want to thank you for your comments. It just really makes my day. It makes all of our days.

And I would add that it's a dynamic market we're seeing it change on a daily basis. And at the end of the second quarter, we did see, I would say, the market coming more to us on the pricing side and so on new business. It's 1 month of an end of a quarter, so it may not make a trend but we did see some improvement in new business towards the tail end of the second quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question, Paul. Yes Greg, Steve Spray. On -- specifically on commercial property and personal property and homeowner, it's about 2/3 exposure, about 1/3 rate would be a good way to look at it. Yes. Over -- I think over the last '22 -- the end of '22 and prior, Mike, again, this is Steve Spray. Our combined ratio in umbrella was running around 80%. The last, like you said the last couple of years, have been challenging. It's jurisdictional. It could be state by state, it's risk by risk. And that loss ratio, like Steve said in the prepared remarks, we've been profitable here for the first half and obviously in the second quarter. We've been very deliberate about improving that line of business. And I would say, yes, we expect that loss ratio to improve from where it is today. I'll give you maybe a little bit more color on that, too. In the second quarter, our commercial umbrella net written premium was down 9 points which contributed a 2-point drag on the overall Commercial Lines net written premium. So it's been deliberate like Steve said, we got early and often with our agents to make sure that there's no surprises and work with them on pricing terms, conditions, reducing limits in some specific jurisdictions or specific risks that we think we -- that have been challenging for us. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Steve Spray again. Yes, we feel really good and are bullish about personal lines, both on the high net worth and then the middle market business. The high net worth now or what we -- Cincinnati Private Client has become about 55% of our business. I would start with the fact that the team we have, the amount of expertise that we have selectively had joined from the outside and then the long-term associates we've had in building out that expertise not only on product but on marketing, on claims. I think we have been very well received across the country by our agents. And specifically growing it in states that you mentioned where there's been quite a bit of industry disruption. And we have definitely seen quite a bit of disruption, especially for the high net worth business. And as an example, 1 way we were able to deal with that is we were able to pivot in California as a specific example and move to writing homeowners business on an excess and surplus lines basis. And I think it goes true to Cincinnati over time as we've been able to be there for our agents and be there for the policyholders in their community provide, we think, measured capacity. We are in this high net worth business for the long term. We look at everything we do over the long term. And feel like we're positioned really well to continue to grow that business and grow it profitably. We have some work to do. Inflation has impacted the entire book but we're confident in the underwriting and especially the pricing actions we've taken to improve those results. I can -- Grace, Steve Spray. I can take a shot at that. We have individual state plans, both for all lines -- for all lines and segments. But in Commercial Lines specifically and we -- the first thing we look at, I think, at every state is just the cat profile. We do believe you can underwrite and price for cat, you have to. And I would think terms, conditions percentage deductibles for cat. We've got the tools to understand what the -- what our average annual loss looks like. We price to that. So I think you're seeing improvement just because of the discipline that we've put both in the cat and the non-cat. I don't know if anybody else wants to add anything as far as numbers."

Investment income continued at a strong pace of 13% for the second quarter of 2023 versus last year's second quarter. As expected, dividend income decreased 3% for the quarter due to 2 items we touched on last quarter. First, we are seeing dividend rates increase more slowly. Second, in last year's second quarter, we received a $5 million special dividend from 1 of our stockholdings that didn't repeat this year. Net equity security purchases for the first half of 2023 totaled $93 million. Bond interest income rose 19% in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with the net purchases totaling $732 million for the first 6 months of the year. The second quarter pretax average yield of 4.34% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 34 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pretax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2023 was 5.88%. Valuation changes in aggregate for our equity portfolio during the second quarter of 2023 were favorable but were unfavorable for the bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain for the equity portfolio was $459 million, while the net loss for the bond portfolio was $158 million. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $6.1 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $838 million. Strong cash flow again contributed to investment income growth in addition to rising bond yields boosting interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first 6 months of 2023 was $825 million, up 9% from a year ago. We continue to emphasize expense management with a balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The second quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.2 percentage points lower than last year as premium growth outpaced growth in total expenses. Next, I'll comment on loss reserves. We continue to use a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first half of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $452 million, including $358 million for the IBNR portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $101 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.5 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first 6 months of 2023 included: favorable $99 million for 2022; unfavorable $5 million for 2021; favorable $49 million for 2020 and a favorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. Regarding capital management, our approach remains consistent as we pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We still believe our financial flexibility is outstanding and that our financial strength is in excellent shape. During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased approximately 398,000 shares at an average price per share of $104.48. We also paid $117 million in dividends to shareholders during the quarter. As usual, I'll conclude with a summary of second quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting increased book value by $0.24. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.15. Investment income other than life insurance and net of noninsurance items added $0.86. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio decreased book value by $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $2.31 and we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $2 per share during the second quarter to $7.33 per share. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. That's right, Fred."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website, cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you will first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President, Steve Spray; and Cincinnati Insurance\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and, therefore, is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I\u2019ll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $225 million for the first quarter of 2023 rebounded from a net loss position for the same quarter a year ago. As gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income, we\u2019ll continue to experience these swings. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value, and this year, we recognize a significant investment gain. We aren\u2019t concerned with these quarterly fluctuations in our equity portfolio. We believe the value will continue to grow over the long-term. Currently, our equity portfolio holds $5.7 billion in appreciated value. Non-GAAP operating income of $141 million for the quarter was down $119 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $163 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 100.7% first quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 10.8 percentage points higher than last year\u2019s first quarter driven by an increase of 11.0 points for catastrophe losses. Our first quarter 90.1% ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 0.8 percentage points worse than the same period a year ago, but 0.1 points better than the full 2022 ex-cat accident year combined ratio of 90.2% that we reported at our last conference call. Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and the persistency of elevated inflation effects, we see several reasons to be confident about performance for the remainder of the year. Pricing during the first quarter of this year was higher than the fourth quarter of last year for each major line of business. To help address inflation, we also make changes to factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs. On a current accident year basis, measured at March 31st before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 6.7 percentage points on a case incurred basis, which includes a 1.6 point improvement on a paid basis. However, we increased the incurred but not reported, or IBNR, component of the ratio by 9.2 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We also earned a small underwriting profit on our commercial umbrella line for the quarter, another positive given recent quarter challenges we and the industry have experienced in various casualty lines of business. We\u2019re proud of our underwriters, who are working with Cincinnati\u2019s appointed insurance agencies to overcome various challenges facing our industry. They continue to emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing the ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. While the first quarter of last year was a record high for new business at that time and created a difficult comparison for growth this year, we believe our associates\u2019 pricing and underwriting discipline was also a factor in our 14% reduction in commercial lines, new business written premiums in the first quarter of this year. Turning to net written premiums, the consolidated property casualty result rose 6% for the first quarter. That included a 10% increase in the first quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment had estimated average renewal price increases near the high end of the mid-single digit range. Our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment moved higher in the high-single digit range. And personalized average renewal price increases were in the mid-single digit range, including both auto and homeowner. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates will continue to rise for our personal auto line of business reaching a full year 2023 premium rate increase of approximately 10%. I\u2019ll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by insurance segment. Commercial lines grew first quarter 2023 net written premiums 4%. Its combined ratio was 8.1 percentage points higher than a year ago including 9.0 points from catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 20% largely from planned expansion of Cincinnati Private Client business for high net worth clients of our agencies. Its combined ratio was 28.6 percentage points higher than a year ago, including 23.0 points from catastrophe losses. Excess and Surplus Lines had a combined ratio of 89.9% with net written premiums growing 10%. Its combined ratio was 4.0 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 16.0 point increase in the IBNR component. But both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global had an impressive level of profitability for the first quarter of 2023. Cincinnati Re had a 79.6% combined ratio, while net written premiums decreased by 9%. We benefited from the firm reinsurance market. Our pricing is stronger relative to the risk we assumed and we tightened terms and conditions while also exercising underwriting discipline. We reallocated capacity to participations where seating companies selected higher loss retention levels and non-renewed certain quota share reinsurance treaties where we had previously assumed risk on a retrocessional basis. Cincinnati Global\u2019s combined ratio was 87.5% with net written premium growing 25%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income up 12% from last year\u2019s first quarter in term life insurance earn premium growth of 4%. I\u2019ll conclude as usual with the value creation ratio. Our primary measure of long-term financial performance, our first quarter 2023 VCR was 3.1%. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.3% while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 1.9%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will comment on other key factors of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow of 14% for the first quarter 2023 versus last year and now pacing the 12% we reported for the fourth quarter. Dividend income increased by 2% for the quarter as dividend rates are increasing more slowly. Looking ahead to next quarter\u2019s dividend growth, you may remember we received a $5 million special dividend from one of our stock holdings in last year\u2019s second quarter. That will make for a tough comparison in the second quarter of 2023. Net equity security purchases for the first quarter totaled $18 million. Bond interest income was up 14% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $303 million for the first three months of the year. The pre-tax average yield of 4.25% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 24 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds during the first quarter 2023 was 6.18%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was $269 million before tax effects. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $684 million. Cash flow continued to augment rising bond yields, helping to grow interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2023 was $250 million up 26% from a year ago. Regarding expense management, we intend to appropriately balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.7 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from a smaller ratio for accrued profit sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Moving on to loss reserves, we maintain a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the first quarter of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss, loss expense reserves was $271 million, including $266 million for the IBNR portion. We experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first three months of 2023 included favorable $44 million for 2022, unfavorable $2 million for 2021, favorable $34 million for 2020 and unfavorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. We remain steadfast in how we approach capital management and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We believe our financial flexibility is quite good and that we have excellent financial strength. During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased nearly 202,000 shares at an average price per share of $123.84. As in the past, I\u2019ll conclude with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.05. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.12. Investment income other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items headed $0.46. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value by $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.53. And we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 per share during the first quarter to $68.33 per share. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019d like to comment on some transitions within our Cincinnati Re team. Later in the first quarter, Managing Director and Head of Cincinnati Re, Jamie Hole resigned to pursue other interests. We thank Jamie for his significant contributions to our reinsurance business and for his work in assembling a strong team of seasoned reinsurance professionals. We wish him well with his motor sports ambitions and with any other future endeavors. Phil Sandercox, who has led our Casualty Reinsurance division since 2016 is now leading Cincinnati Re. Phil has more than 35 years of reinsurance experience, including leadership roles with Aspen Re America and Gen Re. We are all confident in the future of Cincinnati Re under Phil\u2019s leadership and look forward to continuing to grow this aspect of our business over time. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Marlee, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Greg, please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Well, good morning, everyone.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Yes. I\u2019d like to begin, I was going through your press release and on Page 4, you talk about how the commercial lines average renewal pricing was near the high end of the mid single digit percent range. And then in the next sentence, and you commented this in your \u2013 in the prepared remarks, you talked about the 14% decrease in new business written by agencies. So it seems to be moving in two different directions, strong pricing or increasing pricing. And is it increased competition? Maybe you could give us a sense of why pricing\u2019s holding up yet there\u2019s more competition or for new business at least.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Greg, thanks. Steve Spray here. First of all, on that higher end of the mid single digit range on average, I think the key to that for us as well, and I like to talk about it is just the segmentation that we have in the book. So the average, it certainly doesn\u2019t tell the entire story. We\u2019re segmenting the book. We\u2019re getting more rate on those risks that we feel like we need more and then really focused on retaining those accounts that we feel we\u2019ve got an adequate price on. Rates are still strong on the renewal book. And then to your question on new business, the field reps across the country whose primary responsibilities to underwrite and price new commercial lines business. They have just executed precisely the way we have wanted them to. And it is around underwriting and pricing discipline. We\u2019ve got the tools for them to use per risk to know how their pricing is on our \u2013 on each one of those risks. And they\u2019ve just been showing just great discipline on the pricing. So it\u2019s \u2013 it is really around, I would say, price adequacy is where we\u2019re feeling the pressure and competition I think from other markets.\nGreg Peters: Just as a follow-up to that answer, is there any geographic areas that are seem to be running a little hotter from a competition standpoint or is it just fairly broad based?\nSteve Spray: I would say, there are areas that get hotter than others from time to time, Greg. And the way we look at the business is we still think insurance \u2013 in commercial insurance is a local business. So we\u2019ll have local competitors or regional competitors in probably almost every state where we do business. Obviously, we compete with the nationals as well. But yes, there are different jurisdictions that will run hotter or colder than others or you\u2019ll see increased competition more so in a specific state than you will another, but it bounces around quite a bit, quite frankly.\nGreg Peters: Yes. I guess, the second and another question I have is just like on the underlying margin in commercial, it seems like [indiscernible] inflation running there. I was going over your statistics and the commercial casualty property and auto. Can you talk about how you\u2019re feeling about your reserve position and the inflation trends? Have you altered your inflation assumption rates for 2023 versus 2022, et cetera?\nSteve Johnston: Greg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think, for your question, we still see inflation. We feel that we are in a good position in terms of, as Steve described, the \u2013 and I described in the set presentation, the increases that we are getting in terms of keeping pace and exceeding our loss cost inflation. Keep in mind for us, it\u2019s always perspective. We\u2019re basically always trying to look at data that we have, forecast out what we think will be the lost costs in prospective policy periods, and then do our best to charge premiums that cover those lost costs and provide our target profit returns. And we feel we\u2019re in a good position to do that and also our underwriting. Everybody on the team is chipping in on this in terms of underwriting. Steve mentioned a segmentation, our book continues to shift to a mix that we feel is a mix that contains more of the policies with the high profit potential than the low profit potential. That\u2019s an ongoing effort that we have and we feel very optimistic about our future prospects.\nGreg Peters: Those are good points. Thanks for the answers.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from BMO. Mike, please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning. I guess, first question on stick with commercial lines and kind of talk about pricing versus exposure. So I feel like you and others have talked about updating replacement costs, which I believe is more on the property side to reflect the inflationary levels of inflation to per square foot to replace things. And am I correct that runs through exposure, not through pricing? And if so kind of, is there any numbers you can put around where you are in terms of getting your exposure levels to kind of be in line with the updated replacement costs? And is that also \u2013 is this phenomenon also driving up pure pricing exposure too. Thanks.\nSteve Spray: Mike, again, Steve Spray. Great point and yes. For \u2013 guys, for quite a few quarters now, we have continued to \u2013 quite frankly, we\u2019re always taking increases in the exposure on the property side and on the casualty side for that matter, you have wage inflation, you have increased sales on casualty. But on the property, we always are taking inflationary increases on property values. And as those have obviously increased or been persistent, we\u2019ve increased those percentages. As far as a breakdown between net rate and exposure change on commercial property, I would say, it\u2019s about 50-50 for the first quarter \u2013 I\u2019ll just speak to the first quarter of 2023. But it\u2019s about half and half rate and exposure. And I know you\u2019re not asking this right on that specific question, but you have the same phenomenon in homeowner as you do commercial property.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. And so then back to the previous question, [indiscernible] if we think about your pricing and premium growth, it would \u2013 is it the premium growth decelerated a lot. Is \u2013 was there \u2013 is it just there were some tough comps or are you kind of \u2013 are there like some types of maybe corrective actions being taken to get the combined ratio down to lower levels? And then I know my next question is on the catastrophe load, so I don\u2019t know if that delves into that too.\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think \u2013 this is Steve Spray, again, Steve Johnston may want to weigh in here as well. I do think, yes, it is. It\u2019s pricing and underwriting discipline that is showing up. Our retentions remained strong, but mix of business can change a bit. That can affect that, obviously, the new business being under a bit of pressure from our underwriting action and/or pricing. If you would note in the last several quarters, we\u2019ve had some increased loss experience in umbrella, we\u2019re taking corrective action as an example in our umbrella line of book, reducing capacity, increasing pricing, that\u2019s putting pressure on the umbrella policy retention. So it\u2019s a multitude of things. It\u2019s a great question, but there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there as you pointed out.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, great. And my final question was just, is it fair for us and I appreciate one of the reasons, we\u2019re all in business is to protect against catastrophe losses. And so it\u2019s just inherently going to be volatile. But the catastrophe levels, it feels like it\u2019s been a bit of a trend higher than expected if I think over the last decade plus. So is it fair for us in our models to just look at an average of since these catastrophe losses by segment over we can do, we can go back 15 years or so. Is that the way you guys think about it? And I know there\u2019s changing dynamics too with higher reinsurance costs too, which some companies have kind of told us, I know there\u2019s still ongoing negotiations, but they\u2019ve kind of hinted at we might be retaining more, which you guys gave some disclosure too, which could also increase the catastrophe load level. So any thoughts on whether Cinci is also kind of thinking that maybe catastrophe levels are expected to be a bit higher on a forward basis?\nSteve Johnston: This is Steve Johnston. And Mike, the way we go about it and we don\u2019t give guidance on the cats is we do a combination of looking at our past experience, the way you described it, but also using our models, the catastrophe models in terms of building the loads that we have in. And there is just volatility across time. I think one of the makeups of our business that might be different is that we have a more exposure to severe convective storm, which has a higher frequency, but lower severity distribution. And we have just seen more of that type of loss particularly here in the first quarter, but over a period of time. So we focus on the overall and realizing we\u2019re going to have losses, whether they be cats or they\u2019re in the ex-cat bucket and focus on making sure that we can keep that combined ratio to our target level. And I think we\u2019ve been successful with it now with 11 years in a row with a combined ratio under 100. And so we\u2019ll continue to take action to help mitigate the catastrophe losses in our underwriting and selection and so forth. I would say, since we did increase the retention on our cat program and talked about that in the last call, that would not have an impact on the cats that occurred in the first quarter of this year, they were all under $100 million, which was our retention prior to our change.\nMike Zaremski: Helpful, thank you.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Paul, please go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Well, I was hoping first you could maybe dumb down for me, the IBNR increase in the quarter and where the pieces of that added conservativeness is coming from and just how we should \u2013 maybe just a little bit more of how you think we should interpret that piece in particular.\nMike Sewell: Paul, this is Mike. So let me \u2013 I\u2019ll make a brief comment and then whether or not anyone else wants to add on to that. But for the IBNR for the quarter, we do lay that out really nicely, I think on Page 10 in the supplement. And so you obviously know that you can see from there that through March, we added $209 million of net loss IBNR, and that compared to an increase of $52 million through the same quarter of last year. The largest increase of that IBNR in the first quarter was related to the commercial casualty, which was about $101 million. We did add $50 million of IBNR between CGU and Cinci Re. We added some on the E&S $26 million there. And then also commercial auto, $24 million and homeowner, $21 million. Part of the $209 million in total that was added, there was a $19 million decrease in IBNR related to catastrophes. So we had some favorable development in there. But, of course, IBNR is only one ingredient to the entire loss combined ratio, et cetera, so \u2013 but that\u2019s kind of a summary. And maybe, Steve, if you got anything else to tell.\nSteve Johnston: Yes, excellent coverage by Mike there. And I thought I would also maybe talk a little bit about more, maybe a little more detail on the comment I made in my fixed talk about the current accident year quarter having an improvement on a case incurred basis. And when we speak case incurred, and I think it\u2019s pretty common for the industry, it would be the paid losses plus the case reserve. And that\u2019s where we saw \u2013 when we look at those two elements, a 6.7 percentage point improvement over the first quarter a year ago. However, we did add IBNR of 9.2% loss ratio points. So we think it\u2019s a good point to make and that we see the improvement in the underlying case incurred ratio. But prudent as we always are with reserves as the \u2013 we recognize that the first accident quarter is very green. We did add a pretty substantial amount of IBNR. And so I think it gives us a good position and that we\u2019re seeing improvement in the paid \u2013 in the case yet we\u2019re still being true to our prudent reserving and the strong balance sheet that we always advocate. And actually, while it wasn\u2019t in the script, the same would hold for our first quarter calendar year loss ratio improvement in the paid, improvement in the changing case. And we added about 10.5 points of IBNR. And so in total, it was up 1.7%. But kind of decomposing that total loss ratio into paid case IBNR and comparing it to the quarter prior. Just thought I give a little more color on that.\nPaul Newsome: That\u2019s great. And I apologize if I was just a little slow. Separate question. I think on the last earnings conference call, you folks mentioned that you thought that the company was capable this year getting in sort of mid to low 90s combined ratio. Maybe you could square those comments with what happened in the actual results in the first quarter. And should we think about the remainder of the year differently, given what happened in the fourth quarter? Just to kind of maybe square those comments with what happened and how we should think about it prospectively.\nSteve Johnston: Sure, Paul. And you\u2019re never slow on anything. You always are on top of things. We still feel confident in the same guidance that we gave. The last time, I think, catastrophe losses are a little higher than we would have probably anticipated for our first quarter, but we still have three quarters to go. And with all the positives we see happening in terms of pricing, segmentation, underwriting, loss control, the whole team effort that we\u2019re putting forth, we still stand by the same guidance.\nPaul Newsome: Great, thanks. Appreciate the help as always.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: We now have a question from Meyer Shields from KBW. Mayer, please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks and good morning all. First question, I guess, it seems like at 1/1, there was no shortage of well-priced property premium reinsurance premium available for anyone that wanted it. And we didn\u2019t see or we saw the decline in reinsurance premiums I don\u2019t know breakdown between property and other lines. But I was hoping you could sort of describe your current appetite for \u2013 specifically for cat reinsurance business.\nSteve Johnston: Yes, excellent question. The net written premium for Cincinnati Re was down. I think it was due to intentional action that we took in a couple of areas. One, we were assuming business retrocessional business. And as part of a re-underwriting effort or looking at the Cincinnati Re book, we didn\u2019t feel that we wanted to do that anymore. And so, we exited doing property retrocession assuming. And that premium decrease really represented all of the decrease in the Cincinnati Re premium for the quarter as a result of not \u2013 no longer doing property retrocession reinsurance. We also \u2013 as we look at each contract quantitatively, qualitatively and look at the risk reward, felt that we were best served to go higher as other companies increase their retention the way we did, those that we were reinsuring we\u2019re doing the same. We stayed with those at better rates, better terms and conditions I\u2019d say, on that property part, strong double-digit increases. And so, with the reinsurance business, it\u2019s profit first and we are looking at every avenue of growing and growing profitably. This quarter we thought we needed to take some action there with the retrocessions. But we are very confident on a go-forward basis of continued growth as you kind of suggest in your question, it\u2019s out there. We have a talented, very talented team that is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I really appreciate the clarification. Second question, this is more of a process question. We\u2019re hearing a lot of discussion of catastrophe exposed primary property moving from admitted paper to an E&S market. And I was wondering, within Cincinnati, is there like a official capability to transfer that program from your admitted segments to E&S?\nSteve Spray: Meyer, Steve Spray. With E&S business, the \u2013 I guess the official process is, is every state is a little different. When you have an account that\u2019s admitted, you need to typically get a certain number of admitted market declinations before you can export that to the non-admitted market. And so I think to answer your question, if I don\u2019t hit it, follow up on that with me, but to just move something from our admitted market into non-admitted you cannot do that. You need to get the \u2013 you need to follow the \u2013 what they call a diligent search to do that. That being said, we are \u2013 our E&S business CSU is about 90% casualty. We are writing an increased amount of homeowner business on an excess of surplus basis. And I think we\u2019re doing an excellent job providing our agents and the policyholders in their communities with alternatives and with capacity in areas that are maybe a little more just \u2013 they\u2019re prone to an E&S solution. And I think we\u2019ve been able to be very nimble, very flexible and really step up for our agents and \u2013 on E&S on all fronts. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nMeyer Shields: It does, very thoroughly. Thank you. And then one final question. And it\u2019s going to sound like nitpicking, so I apologize in advance. But Steve Johnston was \u2013 in introductory comments you talked about uncertainty over loss trends. And I guess I was wondering whether it\u2019s actual uncertainty or whether we\u2019re seeing practically speaking, in casualty lines like real signs of loss trends just maybe the word uncertainty surprised me.\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I think uncertainty had to do with when you\u2019re making trends coming out of the pandemic and the time period that you look at and when you look at increasing inflation in different areas and how it\u2019s evolving, social inflation, I think economic conditions in terms of what one might expect in terms of a possible recession, just all the various different things of uncertainty that go into it. It was more of a, I think, a general statement, Meyer.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thank you for your patience and for clarifications.\nSteve Johnston: No, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a good question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC. Mark, please proceed.\nMark Dwelle: Yes, good morning. I think what I want to try to do is just knit together some of the things that we\u2019ve been talking about already this morning and in the 10-K or the \u2013 hello?\nSteve Johnston: We\u2019re here. We\u2019re here. Can you hear us?\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Yes, I was getting some echo. In the 10-Q, there\u2019s a comment with respect to the commercial umbrella that kind of added \u2013 it suggested that it added about 1 point to the commercial lines combined ratio in the quarter. It also suggested in the same subsequent paragraph that there was a substantial IBNR add. And then I think you said in your opening remarks that you\u2019re kind of pleased with the fact that, that line had become profitable this quarter after \u2013 that was a line that had been difficult over the last several quarters and certainly gave rise to some reserve adds earlier last year. So I guess what I wanted to try to ask is maybe using that particular line as a lens, what are you trying to communicate there? Is this a line that you like or a line that is rehabilitating? I guess I feel like there\u2019s a lot of different noise going on and the different things that you\u2019re trying to communicate there.\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I guess, cutting right to the chase, it is a line that we like. It is a line that we saw a challenge last year. It is a line where we\u2019ve taken corrective action on multiple fronts, and we see it in an improving fashion now. And it did produce a small underwriting profit for the first quarter that we were happy to see. And so I think the most important point is it\u2019s been a line of business that has been good to us for decades in terms of growth and profitability, and we think it will in the future and that it\u2019s needed a little bit more attention here of late and that we\u2019ve given it that attention.\nMark Dwelle: And then \u2013 and so the drag that it\u2019s producing on the overall combined ratio, is that exclusively the result of the IBNR add? Or is that just reflective of the fact of where it is in its, I\u2019ll call it, rehabilitation cycle that it had been a bigger drag, and now it is a smaller drag even with an IBNR add?\nSteve Johnston: That\u2019s right. And it is, I think, comparing to our ex-cat combined ratio that when we talk about the deterioration.\nMark Dwelle: Right, of course. Okay. Yes. And I think you had commented earlier about some of the pricing action. Can you give a general idea of where \u2013 I know the overall growth in the line was about 10% on the premium side, what the \u2013 where the range of pricing improvement on that is?\nMike Sewell: Yes. Yes. Mark, I would say that that the price \u2013 that\u2019s almost exclusively price in that 10%.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. So we\u2019re really not \u2013 so the exposure is probably flat to even maybe declining a little bit. And the rate is really everything that\u2019s happening there?\nMike Sewell: That\u2019s correct.\nMark Dwelle: Got it. Okay. The second thing, I \u2013 again, this is building on a question you just answered for Meyer. I just wanted to make sure I kind of got that right. As far as the decline in premium in the reinsurance unit, it sounds like it\u2019s ultimately sort of two things. One being that you\u2019ve exited some portion of the retro, the property retro market. And the second is that you\u2019re higher in the tower. So accordingly, you\u2019re getting less premium and accordingly in theory should be taking more distant exposure all else equal. So if I reached the right conclusion on that, you have net reduced your overall CAT and property exposure as a result of the underwriting actions you\u2019re taking there.\nSteve Johnston: That\u2019s exactly right. And Mark, probably well state more \u2013 better stated than I did.\nMark Dwelle: I had the advantage of being able to listen to the answer first. All right. And then I \u2013 one more question that I wanted to talk about and this is on the personal line side, and it\u2019s also going to be a catastrophe related kind of question. So you had 30 points of current period CAT exposure. In my recollection that\u2019s among the highest ever for that, that segment of the business. As you think about the 30 points that you had and I \u2013 we know that there\u2019s a certain number of events in the quarter. When I think about that number should \u2013 is that a product of the particular geographies that were impacted? Was it a product of the changes that you\u2019ve made and where your reinsurance attaches and how that coverage operates? Or was it a change in the fact that you\u2019re writing a lot more high net worth homeowners and accordingly, pound for pound if the tornado hits $1 million house, that\u2019s a bigger impact than if it hits a $500,000 house? Which of those pieces I guess dominates as far as why that number was quite as large as it was?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I would say, first off, I wanted to clarify that it didn\u2019t have to do with us buying less reinsurance. And that for those that occurred in the first quarter, each of them were under $100 million, which was our retention in 2022. So our raising our retention did not impact that any. I think that it was just widespread. I think that for the third quarter in a row, we had one that happened on virtually the last day of the quarter, which makes it a little bit tougher to estimate in the timeframes we have to estimate them, which leads to a little bit of uncertainty still saying we made our best estimate in the \u2013 in our claims. People do a great job of being out there and on the spot and making estimates, but it was just a widespread quarter where there were a lot of catastrophes that that affected us.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. So if I\u2019m hearing you\u2019re right on that, it\u2019s sort of a frequency plus maybe a little extra scoop of conservatism just because it was right at the end of the quarter.\nSteve Johnston: Certainly on the frequency, I\u2019m hoping that way on the extra scoop. But we do go with our best estimate and we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that one plays out. I might have tipped my hand a little bit to my personal thoughts on that.\nMark Dwelle: Alrighty then. I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks for the answers.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Grace Carter from Bank of America. Grace, please go ahead.\nGrace Carter: Hi everyone.\nSteve Johnston: Hi Grace.\nGrace Carter: So new business written has been pretty strong and personal lines for the past several quarters, I was just wondering how that\u2019s trended relative to expectations as you\u2019ve ramped up rate increases and how you see that progressing over the course of the year as you continue to do so. And if there\u2019s just any differences you\u2019re expecting this pricing cycle versus previous periods where you\u2019ve needed higher rate just given the increased tilt towards high net worth business. Thanks.\nSteve Spray: Grace, Steve Spray, great question. I think a lot of the growth that you\u2019re seeing in personal lines is our continued growth in the high net worth area. I would also add that we\u2019re now about as a company, we\u2019re about 50% high net worth or private client and 50% middle market. And we think that gives us an advantage in the marketplace for our agents. And over the last several years, personal lines was taking necessary corrective action, primarily in the middle market space pretty tough action in some specific states. And that put a lot of pressure on growth over time. And we think we\u2019ve got that turned. And so that now bottoming out and coming back up has helped us with growth in personal lines. I would also add that we have continued to improve in pricing sophistication in personal lines that\u2019s contributing there as well. I might add that, and Steve mentioned it in his script of what we\u2019re doing with rate increases and as those continue to come in to the written premium and then also as over a longer period of time as they continue to earn, I would expect that it\u2019s going to put some pressure on our new business growth.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And just one more quick question, is there anything worth calling out from the recent reforms in Florida in the results this quarter?\nSteve Spray: Again, Grace, this is Steve Spray. I would say that we look at the changes in Florida just on the surface as very positive. We think it\u2019s a move in the right direction, but I think it is far too early to tell how that\u2019s going to play out. Well, we think it\u2019s promising something we\u2019re going to watch very closely, but probably too early to draw any conclusions.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mike Zaremski with a follow-up at BMO. Mike, please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Let me re-up [ph]. I guess, you gave us some good color on the paid loss ratios improving a bit, which we can also do the math ourselves. I guess, so you didn\u2019t umbrella that issue on a commercial umbrella which popped up last year. It\u2019s \u2013 you guys didn\u2019t specifically mention it. Is \u2013 do you feel that the trends you\u2019re seeing are normalizing commercial auto for the industry too and for everyone seems to be kind of getting worse again with social inflation potentially. Or maybe it\u2019s just coming on the severity side. So just kind of curious, so pricings moving in the right direction, seems like the paid loss ratio moving in the right direction. But do you \u2013 maybe you could touch on commercial auto and umbrella and do you feel like industry-wide pricing is moving in the right direction because loss costs are also kind of moving a bit higher?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. This is Steve Johnston. Good question, Mike. I do think that we\u2019re taking the appropriate action. I do think that we\u2019re seeing a little bit more of a normalization of the trends in umbrella. However, I want to be cautionary in that it\u2019s still for us volume wise, it\u2019s a low frequency, high severity line for us. So it is going to have noise from time to time and that makes the trends a little bit harder. But I do think that we\u2019re seeing the action that we\u2019re taking both on the pricing and underwriting side having a positive effect. And I would say basically the same thing for commercial auto. It\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve paid good attention to over a long period of time and I think we\u2019re on the right track and feel optimistic about it.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. And maybe last follow-up, just because since you has best-in-class disclosure on the property side, both on commercial and personal lines, is it fair to look at a ratio excluding large losses and then looking at the action you\u2019re that way because it \u2013 if you do that the action your loss ratio is up on the property lines. Any thoughts there?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. I think and thank you for the complement on the transparency and the disclosure. I think what we like to do is lay it out there with as much detail for you so that different people, different analysts have different ways that they go about making their forecast. And so if you want to do something ex-CAT ex-large loss and then build in a kind of a long-term provision for both, or you want to do it just ex-CAT build in a long-term provision for ex-CAT, you can do it that way. So we just basically try to lay out as much detail as we can for you be as transparent as possible and give you as much information as we can so that you can do your jobs well.\nMike Zaremski: And so if we do that the underlying ratios and property have been getting going higher, getting worse is that why there\u2019s corrective actions being taken and pricings moving higher and is that a fair way of looking at things and why you\u2019re getting more exposure to re-price on the replacement costs is just trying to see if that\u2019s \u2013 that ratio is okay for us to look at as the trend still looks like it. It\u2019s not improving at this point.\nSteve Johnston: Yes. No, we have been taking the rate and property and corrective action and property for some time. We do our rate indications in terms of where we\u2019re getting the rate, we feel comfortable as we do our forecasts on the property line. We\u2019re getting solid rate increases, solid increase in terms of the exposures that Steve mentioned earlier. Really looking at our underwriting as well improving on our technology and just really addressing it at all in all fronts and feel pretty good about the way we\u2019re going.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. Thanks for answering a number of tough questions. Thank you.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Johnston for any closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Marlee. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Saturday May 6 at the Cincinnati Art Museum. You\u2019re also welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting available at cinfin.com/investors, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending Cincinnati Financial\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. Net income of $225 million for the first quarter of 2023 rebounded from a net loss position for the same quarter a year ago. As gains and losses from securities still held in our equity portfolio run through net income, we'll continue to experience these swings. Last year, we saw a reduction in portfolio fair value, and this year, we recognize a significant investment gain. We aren't concerned with these quarterly fluctuations in our equity portfolio. We believe the value will continue to grow over the long-term. Currently, our equity portfolio holds $5.7 billion in appreciated value. Non-GAAP operating income of $141 million for the quarter was down $119 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $163 million higher on an after-tax basis. Our 100.7% first quarter 2023 property casualty combined ratio was 10.8 percentage points higher than last year's first quarter driven by an increase of 11.0 points for catastrophe losses. Our first quarter 90.1% ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 0.8 percentage points worse than the same period a year ago, but 0.1 points better than the full 2022 ex-cat accident year combined ratio of 90.2% that we reported at our last conference call. Despite the increase in catastrophe losses and the persistency of elevated inflation effects, we see several reasons to be confident about performance for the remainder of the year. Pricing during the first quarter of this year was higher than the fourth quarter of last year for each major line of business. To help address inflation, we also make changes to factors that adjust premiums to account for rising property costs. On a current accident year basis, measured at March 31st before catastrophe losses, our 2023 consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense ratio improved from 2022 by 6.7 percentage points on a case incurred basis, which includes a 1.6 point improvement on a paid basis. However, we increased the incurred but not reported, or IBNR, component of the ratio by 9.2 points as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses remaining prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We also earned a small underwriting profit on our commercial umbrella line for the quarter, another positive given recent quarter challenges we and the industry have experienced in various casualty lines of business. We're proud of our underwriters, who are working with Cincinnati's appointed insurance agencies to overcome various challenges facing our industry. They continue to emphasize retention of profitable accounts addressing the ones that we determine have inadequate pricing while also seeking profitable new business. While the first quarter of last year was a record high for new business at that time and created a difficult comparison for growth this year, we believe our associates' pricing and underwriting discipline was also a factor in our 14% reduction in commercial lines, new business written premiums in the first quarter of this year. Turning to net written premiums, the consolidated property casualty result rose 6% for the first quarter. That included a 10% increase in the first quarter renewal written premiums with a significant portion from higher levels of insured exposures as we factor in elevated inflation. Our Commercial Lines Insurance segment had estimated average renewal price increases near the high end of the mid-single digit range. Our Excess and Surplus Lines Insurance segment moved higher in the high-single digit range. And personalized average renewal price increases were in the mid-single digit range, including both auto and homeowner. As we previously disclosed, we expect premium rates will continue to rise for our personal auto line of business reaching a full year 2023 premium rate increase of approximately 10%. I'll briefly highlight premium growth and profitability by insurance segment. Commercial lines grew first quarter 2023 net written premiums 4%. Its combined ratio was 8.1 percentage points higher than a year ago including 9.0 points from catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 20% largely from planned expansion of Cincinnati Private Client business for high net worth clients of our agencies. Its combined ratio was 28.6 percentage points higher than a year ago, including 23.0 points from catastrophe losses. Excess and Surplus Lines had a combined ratio of 89.9% with net written premiums growing 10%. Its combined ratio was 4.0 percentage points higher than a year ago, including a 16.0 point increase in the IBNR component. But both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global had an impressive level of profitability for the first quarter of 2023. Cincinnati Re had a 79.6% combined ratio, while net written premiums decreased by 9%. We benefited from the firm reinsurance market. Our pricing is stronger relative to the risk we assumed and we tightened terms and conditions while also exercising underwriting discipline. We reallocated capacity to participations where seating companies selected higher loss retention levels and non-renewed certain quota share reinsurance treaties where we had previously assumed risk on a retrocessional basis. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was 87.5% with net written premium growing 25%. Our life insurance subsidiary had another good quarter with net income up 12% from last year's first quarter in term life insurance earn premium growth of 4%. I'll conclude as usual with the value creation ratio. Our primary measure of long-term financial performance, our first quarter 2023 VCR was 3.1%. Net income before investment gains or losses contributed 1.3% while favorable valuation of our investment portfolio added another 1.9%. Now our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell will comment on other key factors of our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment on some transitions within our Cincinnati Re team. Later in the first quarter, Managing Director and Head of Cincinnati Re, Jamie Hole resigned to pursue other interests. We thank Jamie for his significant contributions to our reinsurance business and for his work in assembling a strong team of seasoned reinsurance professionals. We wish him well with his motor sports ambitions and with any other future endeavors. Phil Sandercox, who has led our Casualty Reinsurance division since 2016 is now leading Cincinnati Re. Phil has more than 35 years of reinsurance experience, including leadership roles with Aspen Re America and Gen Re. We are all confident in the future of Cincinnati Re under Phil's leadership and look forward to continuing to grow this aspect of our business over time. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Marlee, please open the call for questions. Good morning, Greg. Greg, this is Steve Johnston. And I think, for your question, we still see inflation. We feel that we are in a good position in terms of, as Steve described, the \u2013 and I described in the set presentation, the increases that we are getting in terms of keeping pace and exceeding our loss cost inflation. Keep in mind for us, it's always perspective. We're basically always trying to look at data that we have, forecast out what we think will be the lost costs in prospective policy periods, and then do our best to charge premiums that cover those lost costs and provide our target profit returns. And we feel we're in a good position to do that and also our underwriting. Everybody on the team is chipping in on this in terms of underwriting. Steve mentioned a segmentation, our book continues to shift to a mix that we feel is a mix that contains more of the policies with the high profit potential than the low profit potential. That's an ongoing effort that we have and we feel very optimistic about our future prospects. Thank you, Greg. This is Steve Johnston. And Mike, the way we go about it and we don't give guidance on the cats is we do a combination of looking at our past experience, the way you described it, but also using our models, the catastrophe models in terms of building the loads that we have in. And there is just volatility across time. I think one of the makeups of our business that might be different is that we have a more exposure to severe convective storm, which has a higher frequency, but lower severity distribution. And we have just seen more of that type of loss particularly here in the first quarter, but over a period of time. So we focus on the overall and realizing we're going to have losses, whether they be cats or they're in the ex-cat bucket and focus on making sure that we can keep that combined ratio to our target level. And I think we've been successful with it now with 11 years in a row with a combined ratio under 100. And so we'll continue to take action to help mitigate the catastrophe losses in our underwriting and selection and so forth. I would say, since we did increase the retention on our cat program and talked about that in the last call, that would not have an impact on the cats that occurred in the first quarter of this year, they were all under $100 million, which was our retention prior to our change. Thank you. Yes, excellent coverage by Mike there. And I thought I would also maybe talk a little bit about more, maybe a little more detail on the comment I made in my fixed talk about the current accident year quarter having an improvement on a case incurred basis. And when we speak case incurred, and I think it's pretty common for the industry, it would be the paid losses plus the case reserve. And that's where we saw \u2013 when we look at those two elements, a 6.7 percentage point improvement over the first quarter a year ago. However, we did add IBNR of 9.2% loss ratio points. So we think it's a good point to make and that we see the improvement in the underlying case incurred ratio. But prudent as we always are with reserves as the \u2013 we recognize that the first accident quarter is very green. We did add a pretty substantial amount of IBNR. And so I think it gives us a good position and that we're seeing improvement in the paid \u2013 in the case yet we're still being true to our prudent reserving and the strong balance sheet that we always advocate. And actually, while it wasn't in the script, the same would hold for our first quarter calendar year loss ratio improvement in the paid, improvement in the changing case. And we added about 10.5 points of IBNR. And so in total, it was up 1.7%. But kind of decomposing that total loss ratio into paid case IBNR and comparing it to the quarter prior. Just thought I give a little more color on that. Sure, Paul. And you're never slow on anything. You always are on top of things. We still feel confident in the same guidance that we gave. The last time, I think, catastrophe losses are a little higher than we would have probably anticipated for our first quarter, but we still have three quarters to go. And with all the positives we see happening in terms of pricing, segmentation, underwriting, loss control, the whole team effort that we're putting forth, we still stand by the same guidance. Thank you. Yes, excellent question. The net written premium for Cincinnati Re was down. I think it was due to intentional action that we took in a couple of areas. One, we were assuming business retrocessional business. And as part of a re-underwriting effort or looking at the Cincinnati Re book, we didn't feel that we wanted to do that anymore. And so, we exited doing property retrocession assuming. And that premium decrease really represented all of the decrease in the Cincinnati Re premium for the quarter as a result of not \u2013 no longer doing property retrocession reinsurance. We also \u2013 as we look at each contract quantitatively, qualitatively and look at the risk reward, felt that we were best served to go higher as other companies increase their retention the way we did, those that we were reinsuring we're doing the same. We stayed with those at better rates, better terms and conditions I'd say, on that property part, strong double-digit increases. And so, with the reinsurance business, it's profit first and we are looking at every avenue of growing and growing profitably. This quarter we thought we needed to take some action there with the retrocessions. But we are very confident on a go-forward basis of continued growth as you kind of suggest in your question, it's out there. We have a talented, very talented team that is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities. Yes. I think uncertainty had to do with when you're making trends coming out of the pandemic and the time period that you look at and when you look at increasing inflation in different areas and how it's evolving, social inflation, I think economic conditions in terms of what one might expect in terms of a possible recession, just all the various different things of uncertainty that go into it. It was more of a, I think, a general statement, Meyer. No, that's \u2013 it's a good question. Thank you. We're here. We're here. Can you hear us? Yes. I guess, cutting right to the chase, it is a line that we like. It is a line that we saw a challenge last year. It is a line where we've taken corrective action on multiple fronts, and we see it in an improving fashion now. And it did produce a small underwriting profit for the first quarter that we were happy to see. And so I think the most important point is it's been a line of business that has been good to us for decades in terms of growth and profitability, and we think it will in the future and that it's needed a little bit more attention here of late and that we've given it that attention. That's right. And it is, I think, comparing to our ex-cat combined ratio that when we talk about the deterioration. That's exactly right. And Mark, probably well state more \u2013 better stated than I did. Yes. I would say, first off, I wanted to clarify that it didn't have to do with us buying less reinsurance. And that for those that occurred in the first quarter, each of them were under $100 million, which was our retention in 2022. So our raising our retention did not impact that any. I think that it was just widespread. I think that for the third quarter in a row, we had one that happened on virtually the last day of the quarter, which makes it a little bit tougher to estimate in the timeframes we have to estimate them, which leads to a little bit of uncertainty still saying we made our best estimate in the \u2013 in our claims. People do a great job of being out there and on the spot and making estimates, but it was just a widespread quarter where there were a lot of catastrophes that that affected us. Certainly on the frequency, I'm hoping that way on the extra scoop. But we do go with our best estimate and we'll have to wait and see how that one plays out. I might have tipped my hand a little bit to my personal thoughts on that. Thank you. Hi Grace. Yes. This is Steve Johnston. Good question, Mike. I do think that we're taking the appropriate action. I do think that we're seeing a little bit more of a normalization of the trends in umbrella. However, I want to be cautionary in that it's still for us volume wise, it's a low frequency, high severity line for us. So it is going to have noise from time to time and that makes the trends a little bit harder. But I do think that we're seeing the action that we're taking both on the pricing and underwriting side having a positive effect. And I would say basically the same thing for commercial auto. It's an area where we've paid good attention to over a long period of time and I think we're on the right track and feel optimistic about it. Yes. I think and thank you for the complement on the transparency and the disclosure. I think what we like to do is lay it out there with as much detail for you so that different people, different analysts have different ways that they go about making their forecast. And so if you want to do something ex-CAT ex-large loss and then build in a kind of a long-term provision for both, or you want to do it just ex-CAT build in a long-term provision for ex-CAT, you can do it that way. So we just basically try to lay out as much detail as we can for you be as transparent as possible and give you as much information as we can so that you can do your jobs well. Yes. No, we have been taking the rate and property and corrective action and property for some time. We do our rate indications in terms of where we're getting the rate, we feel comfortable as we do our forecasts on the property line. We're getting solid rate increases, solid increase in terms of the exposures that Steve mentioned earlier. Really looking at our underwriting as well improving on our technology and just really addressing it at all in all fronts and feel pretty good about the way we're going. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Marlee. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Saturday May 6 at the Cincinnati Art Museum. You're also welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting available at cinfin.com/investors, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call. Have a great day."

            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Yes. Greg, thanks. Steve Spray here. First of all, on that higher end of the mid single digit range on average, I think the key to that for us as well, and I like to talk about it is just the segmentation that we have in the book. So the average, it certainly doesn't tell the entire story. We're segmenting the book. We're getting more rate on those risks that we feel like we need more and then really focused on retaining those accounts that we feel we've got an adequate price on. Rates are still strong on the renewal book. And then to your question on new business, the field reps across the country whose primary responsibilities to underwrite and price new commercial lines business. They have just executed precisely the way we have wanted them to. And it is around underwriting and pricing discipline. We've got the tools for them to use per risk to know how their pricing is on our \u2013 on each one of those risks. And they've just been showing just great discipline on the pricing. So it's \u2013 it is really around, I would say, price adequacy is where we're feeling the pressure and competition I think from other markets. I would say, there are areas that get hotter than others from time to time, Greg. And the way we look at the business is we still think insurance \u2013 in commercial insurance is a local business. So we'll have local competitors or regional competitors in probably almost every state where we do business. Obviously, we compete with the nationals as well. But yes, there are different jurisdictions that will run hotter or colder than others or you'll see increased competition more so in a specific state than you will another, but it bounces around quite a bit, quite frankly. Mike, again, Steve Spray. Great point and yes. For \u2013 guys, for quite a few quarters now, we have continued to \u2013 quite frankly, we're always taking increases in the exposure on the property side and on the casualty side for that matter, you have wage inflation, you have increased sales on casualty. But on the property, we always are taking inflationary increases on property values. And as those have obviously increased or been persistent, we've increased those percentages. As far as a breakdown between net rate and exposure change on commercial property, I would say, it's about 50-50 for the first quarter \u2013 I'll just speak to the first quarter of 2023. But it's about half and half rate and exposure. And I know you're not asking this right on that specific question, but you have the same phenomenon in homeowner as you do commercial property. Yes. I think \u2013 this is Steve Spray, again, Steve Johnston may want to weigh in here as well. I do think, yes, it is. It's pricing and underwriting discipline that is showing up. Our retentions remained strong, but mix of business can change a bit. That can affect that, obviously, the new business being under a bit of pressure from our underwriting action and/or pricing. If you would note in the last several quarters, we've had some increased loss experience in umbrella, we're taking corrective action as an example in our umbrella line of book, reducing capacity, increasing pricing, that's putting pressure on the umbrella policy retention. So it's a multitude of things. It's a great question, but there's a lot of moving parts there as you pointed out. Meyer, Steve Spray. With E&S business, the \u2013 I guess the official process is, is every state is a little different. When you have an account that's admitted, you need to typically get a certain number of admitted market declinations before you can export that to the non-admitted market. And so I think to answer your question, if I don't hit it, follow up on that with me, but to just move something from our admitted market into non-admitted you cannot do that. You need to get the \u2013 you need to follow the \u2013 what they call a diligent search to do that. That being said, we are \u2013 our E&S business CSU is about 90% casualty. We are writing an increased amount of homeowner business on an excess of surplus basis. And I think we're doing an excellent job providing our agents and the policyholders in their communities with alternatives and with capacity in areas that are maybe a little more just \u2013 they're prone to an E&S solution. And I think we've been able to be very nimble, very flexible and really step up for our agents and \u2013 on E&S on all fronts. So hopefully, that answers your question. Grace, Steve Spray, great question. I think a lot of the growth that you're seeing in personal lines is our continued growth in the high net worth area. I would also add that we're now about as a company, we're about 50% high net worth or private client and 50% middle market. And we think that gives us an advantage in the marketplace for our agents. And over the last several years, personal lines was taking necessary corrective action, primarily in the middle market space pretty tough action in some specific states. And that put a lot of pressure on growth over time. And we think we've got that turned. And so that now bottoming out and coming back up has helped us with growth in personal lines. I would also add that we have continued to improve in pricing sophistication in personal lines that's contributing there as well. I might add that, and Steve mentioned it in his script of what we're doing with rate increases and as those continue to come in to the written premium and then also as over a longer period of time as they continue to earn, I would expect that it's going to put some pressure on our new business growth. Again, Grace, this is Steve Spray. I would say that we look at the changes in Florida just on the surface as very positive. We think it's a move in the right direction, but I think it is far too early to tell how that's going to play out. Well, we think it's promising something we're going to watch very closely, but probably too early to draw any conclusions."

            "name": "Mike Sewell",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow of 14% for the first quarter 2023 versus last year and now pacing the 12% we reported for the fourth quarter. Dividend income increased by 2% for the quarter as dividend rates are increasing more slowly. Looking ahead to next quarter's dividend growth, you may remember we received a $5 million special dividend from one of our stock holdings in last year's second quarter. That will make for a tough comparison in the second quarter of 2023. Net equity security purchases for the first quarter totaled $18 million. Bond interest income was up 14% in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022. We added more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $303 million for the first three months of the year. The pre-tax average yield of 4.25% for the fixed maturity portfolio was 24 basis points higher than a year ago. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchase taxable and tax exempt bonds during the first quarter 2023 was 6.18%. Valuation changes for our investment portfolio during the first quarter of 2023 were favorable in aggregate for both our stock and bond holdings. The overall net gain for the quarter was $269 million before tax effects. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $5 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $5.7 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $684 million. Cash flow continued to augment rising bond yields, helping to grow interest income. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2023 was $250 million up 26% from a year ago. Regarding expense management, we intend to appropriately balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2023 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 1.7 percentage points lower than last year. Most of the decrease was from a smaller ratio for accrued profit sharing commissions for agencies and related expenses. Moving on to loss reserves, we maintain a consistent approach that targets net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves, and then updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. During the first quarter of 2023, our net increase in property casualty loss, loss expense reserves was $271 million, including $266 million for the IBNR portion. We experienced $59 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first three months of 2023 included favorable $44 million for 2022, unfavorable $2 million for 2021, favorable $34 million for 2020 and unfavorable $17 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. We remain steadfast in how we approach capital management and we repurchased shares that include maintenance intended to offset shares issued through equity compensation plans. We believe our financial flexibility is quite good and that we have excellent financial strength. During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased nearly 202,000 shares at an average price per share of $123.84. As in the past, I'll conclude with a summary of the first quarter contributions to book value per share. They represent the main drivers of our value creation ratio. Property casualty underwriting decreased book value by $0.05. Life insurance operations increased book value $0.12. Investment income other than life insurance and net of non-insurance items headed $0.46. Net investment gains and losses for the fixed income portfolio increased book value by $0.81. Net investment gains and losses for the equity portfolio increased book value by $0.53. And we declared $0.75 per share in dividends to shareholders. The net effect was a book value increase of $1.12 per share during the first quarter to $68.33 per share. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Paul, this is Mike. So let me \u2013 I'll make a brief comment and then whether or not anyone else wants to add on to that. But for the IBNR for the quarter, we do lay that out really nicely, I think on Page 10 in the supplement. And so you obviously know that you can see from there that through March, we added $209 million of net loss IBNR, and that compared to an increase of $52 million through the same quarter of last year. The largest increase of that IBNR in the first quarter was related to the commercial casualty, which was about $101 million. We did add $50 million of IBNR between CGU and Cinci Re. We added some on the E&S $26 million there. And then also commercial auto, $24 million and homeowner, $21 million. Part of the $209 million in total that was added, there was a $19 million decrease in IBNR related to catastrophes. So we had some favorable development in there. But, of course, IBNR is only one ingredient to the entire loss combined ratio, et cetera, so \u2013 but that's kind of a summary. And maybe, Steve, if you got anything else to tell. Yes. Yes. Mark, I would say that that the price \u2013 that's almost exclusively price in that 10%. That's correct."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel : Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our Investor website, investors.cinfin.com. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Spray, and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Chairman, Steve Johnston, Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria, and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Mark Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Teresa Hopper. Please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. Now I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Spray : Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We are pleased with our operating performance for the third quarter and first nine months of the year. Several metrics show the progress we are making as we work to provide value to shareholders over time and to deliver outstanding service to agencies and their clients through our dedicated associates. Our combined ratio continues to improve, absent the volatility caused by severe weather. While the devastation Hurricane Helene, in particular, inflicted on communities is heartbreaking, our claims associates are working tirelessly to deliver superior service with empathy and care. We had another quarter of strong premium growth, bolstered by improved pricing precision and risk segmentation by our underwriters on a policy-by-policy basis. In addition to another quarter with nice investment income growth, we executed investment portfolio rebalancing to a larger degree than a typical quarter. We believe that effort will produce both near-term and long-term financial benefits. Net income of $820 million for the third quarter of 2024 included recognition of $645 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held. Non-GAAP operating income of $224 million for the third quarter was down $37 million from a year ago, driven by an $86 million increase in after-tax catastrophe losses. Our 97.4% third quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 3.0 percentage points higher than the third quarter of last year and included an increase of 3.9 points for catastrophe losses. Our 86.8% accident year 2024 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.9 percentage points compared with accident year 2023 for the third quarter and was 0.8 points better on a nine-month basis. We had another quarter of what we believe is profitable premium growth. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance again produced a robust amount of new business for us and we continue to appoint agencies where we identify appropriate expansion opportunities. Our underwriters use pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases along with careful risk selection to help improve our underwriting profitability. Estimated average renewal price increases for the third quarter improved incrementally compared with the second quarter of this year. Commercial lines moved a little higher in this high single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines remained in the high single-digit range. Our personal line segment also moved a little higher with personal auto in the low double-digit range and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 17% for the quarter, including 16% growth in agency renewal premiums and 30% in new business premiums. As I next comment on performance by insurance segment, I'll focus on third quarter premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial lines grew net written premiums 11%, with an excellent 93.0% combined ratio that improved by 2.2 percentage points, including 1.3 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 29%, including growth in middle market accounts and Cincinnati private client business for our agency's high network clients. Its combined ratio was 110.3%, 10.4 percentage points higher than last year, driven by an increase of 12.7 points from higher catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 23%, with a combined ratio of 95.3%. While that's still quite profitable, it's less so than a year ago due to higher catastrophe losses and a modest amount of unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years. Both Cincinnati REIT and Cincinnati Global were again profitable and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati REIT grew third quarter 2024 net written premiums 5% and had a 95.6% combined ratio, bringing its nine-month combined ratio to a very profitable 81.5%. The $38 million of catastrophe losses Cincinnati REIT reported for the quarter included approximately $19 million for Hurricane Helene. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was an outstanding 66.6% for the third quarter, with 12% growth in net written premiums. Our life insurance subsidiary had another profitable quarter, including net income of $20 million and term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%. Before I close my prepared remarks, I'd like to briefly comment on the estimated effects of Hurricane Milton on fourth quarter results. While it is still early, we estimate our pre-tax incurred losses will total between $75 million and $125 million, net of any applicable reinsurance recoveries. Catastrophe losses for direct business written by the Cincinnati Insurance Company represents less than $15 million of that estimate while Cincinnati REIT represents more than half. Now, I'll conclude as usual with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our third quarter 2024 VCR was 9.0%, bringing the nine-month total to an excellent 17.8%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 1.7%, higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 7.3%. Next, Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell will highlight some additional aspects of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell : Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income had another round of strong growth, up 15% for the third quarter of \u201824, compared with the same quarter in \u201823. Dividend income was down 1%, reflecting $959 million of net sales of equity securities during the third quarter, primarily from some portfolio rebalancing through trimming or exiting positions of seven common stocks among our 63 holdings at the beginning of the quarter. As Steve mentioned in our news release, this does not represent a change in our investment approach of holding a significant amount of equities as we work to balance near-term income generation with long-term book value growth. The large cash balance generated during the third quarter has been reduced and should continue to decline with additional bond purchases during the remainder of the year. Bond interest income grew 21% for the third quarter of this year. Net purchases of fixed maturity securities totaled $672 million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year. The third quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.8% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 36 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of this year was 5.53%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the third quarter were favorable for both our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $841 million for the equity portfolio and $411 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $7.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $203 million. Cash flow, in addition to higher bond yields, again, boosted investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 reached $2 billion, up 36% from a year ago. I'll briefly comment on expense management and our efforts to balance expense control with strategic business investments. The third quarter 2024 property casualty underlying expense ratio decrease of 0.2 percentage points was largely due to lower levels of profit sharing commissions for agencies. Moving on to loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first nine months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $963 million, including $917 million for the IB&R portion. During the third quarter, we experienced $71 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. For commercial casualty line of business, there was no material reserve development for any prior accident year during the quarter. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first nine months of \u201824 included favorable $326 million for \u201823, favorable $55 million for \u201822, favorable $10 million for \u201821, and an unfavorable $180 million in aggregate for accident years prior to \u201821. My final comments pertain to capital management. During the first nine months of 2024, we returned capital to shareholders through $365 million of dividends paid and nearly 1.1 million shares repurchased at an average price of approximately $112 per share. Earlier this month, another dividend was paid, returning another $120 million or so to shareholders. That payment completed the company's 64th consecutive year of increasing shareholder dividends, a streak we believe is matched by only seven other publicly traded companies based in the United States. We believe our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in stellar condition. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end exceeded $5 billion. Debt to total capital remained under 10%. And our quarter end book value was at a record high, $88.32 per share with nearly $14 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Spray: Thanks, Mike. The momentum we have right now is powerful. As we put the finishing touches on department plans for next year, you can feel the excitement and see the opportunities that lie ahead in all corners of the company. Agents Echo that feeling as they comment on their appreciation for our ability to deliver stability, consistency, and financial strength, giving them a first-class carrier to support their most well-managed accounts. Last week, Fitch Ratings Agency agreed, affirming our current financial strength ratings and revising our outlook to positive from stable based on our sustained track record of profitability and proven financial strength. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Soloria, Mark Schambow, and Teresa Hopper. Betsy, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips : Thanks. Michael Phillips from Oppenheimer. I appreciate it. Thanks for the time, and good morning, everybody. I want to start with the commercial casualty. Steve, you mentioned no material favorable PYB there. Last quarter, you had a little bit, and the recent action years are favorable. I say as a backdrop, because if you look at the current action year there, it's up a bit. In commercial casualty, it's up almost 6 points and I kind of want to drill into what's driving that? You say in the Q that for commercial lines total, there's more IBNR. It looks like that might be the case for some other lines, but if we can kind of do back of the envelope, the higher loss pick for commercial casualty, it seems like it might be more paid activity. I want to see if you can confirm that and maybe what else might be going on in commercial casualty? Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Yes, thanks, Mike. Mike Sewell is going to go ahead and tackle this, and then I may add some commentary at the end.\nMike Sewell: No, I appreciate it, and thanks for the question. So, yes, as you already noted, there was no prior accident year that had a material development during this quarter. So, recent quarters, we've added to or we've slowed the release of IBNR reserves as we've reacted to lost payments and case reserve increases that were higher than expected for some accident years related to the commercial casualty line. There has been some higher case incurred losses that were spread across several accident years that was more severity than frequency. But, as you're probably looking at page 9 of the supplement and you're seeing the loss pick being elevated a little bit, it's really, Mike, it's just related to prudent case reserves or prudent reserves that we're adding. There's a lot of uncertainty there. You're seeing a lot of things in the industry that's out there. If I were to take a look at the nine-month compared to nine-month for that loss pick, you're really only about two full points higher. We are adding to the IBNR you've seen that on page 11 of the supplement, and you'll see that the commercial casualty is the largest area that we're adding IBNR. So, that's probably a lot of information, but, yes, that's the background. Thank you.\nMichael Phillips : Okay, thanks. I guess if we stick with that line for a second, Steve, your opening comments didn't seem like there was much of a change in commentary on renewed price changes, and yet this line saw a pretty good jump in premium growth. I'm so curious what's driving that and how we should think about the commercial casualty going forward with top-line growth?\nSteve Spray: Yes, I think, yes, Mike, the pricing there just remains strong. Everything that Mike said, I'd probably focus from the pricing standpoint, just the uncertainty around social inflation, legal system abuse, however you want to title that, but just uncertainty in general. I think the key with us, and I always go back to this, one, we're a package writer. We don't write monoline business. And two, our underwriters, whether they're in the field or here in headquarters, are just tackling these accounts risk by risk. One by one, they're using the art of underwriting that we've all grown up with, and then the science. I think we're kind of at a nice spot intersection there. Just the way we can segment our book with sophisticated pricing tools, I think there's runway and rate in all lines of business and commercial, may be minus workers' compensation, but general liability and umbrella, certainly I think there's runway for more rate there. And currently, as we disclosed, we're getting high single digits in the casualty, but again, that's that point estimate. You really have to look at the -- just kind of the -- that average doesn't tell the whole story. You got to look at the whole book, and there's a fair amount of our book that we would consider price adequate, and then in various levels and tranches where we need more rate.\nMichael Phillips : Okay. Thank you. I'll follow up in a bit. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.\nMichael Zaremski : Okay. Thanks. I guess this is a quick follow-up to the last question and answer on playing offense in commercial casualty, and I could see commercial auto, too. Is it my understanding correctly that you're clearly playing more offense and feel better even despite the loss ratio in those two lines being booked at not ideal levels because you're just being more conservative in your picks like you have historically, and so as the years unfold, hopefully that conservatism comes back in a good guy through reserve releases over time? Am I thinking about it correctly?\nSteve Spray: Yes. Mike, let me -- this is Steve again. Let me try that and then give me a follow-up. First of all, overarching, we feel good about our pricing. Obviously, where we're focused is on prospective pricing or rating periods. So we feel good about our pricing. We feel good about team that's executing on that as well. And we look at that state by state and like I said, risk by risk, by line of business. I would say we're definitely playing offense. We've got $13.8 billion of GAAP equity now supporting a little more than $9 billion of premium. I think that puts us in an enviable position. We -- as you know, our deep relationships with our agents we are regularly communicating with them. And I can tell you that the feedback we get from them is one of the appreciation for our consistency, our stability, our financial strength. We're playing offense, I think, in all segments and all lines of business. We've -- I talk about it a lot when we have these one-on-one investor meetings as well, but we've got that proven track record that proven business model, our field focused, the way we handle claims, our agency focus. But over the last 12, 13 years, the biggest improvement that has really driven our confidence and playing offense is that pricing sophistication and segmentation that we are -- we've been executing on for a decade plus. But that, along with the team that puts those predictive models in play, that just gives me a tremendous amount of confidence in everything we're doing and being able to grow through all market cycles. In Personal Lines, we're -- I've talked about this in the past, too. I think we're in a once in a lifetime, once in a generation, however you'd like to put it, you could call it hard market, I look at it as a market opportunity. And we -- our ex cat there continues to improve. We're not just -- that doesn't make us happy. We got to pay cat dollars with real money. Commercial lines -- or excuse me, personal lines last year had 100.4 combined. The four years prior to that, in a rising cat environment had an all-in underwriting profit. So just feel good about, again, all lines of business and all segments. I hope that answers it.\nMichael Zaremski : Yes. Honestly, if you're booking a much better loss ratio in some of those lines, may be the stock would be up today, but I don't know how much people -- would some people would believe in it. So it seems like you are being conservative, makes sense. I guess just switching gears. So on the large sell-down on the investment portfolio, I think what you're saying is just no real change there due to Steve's new leadership? Or you're just kind of saying, if we just do the math on equities as a percentage of shareholders' equity XOCI, we're running well above historic levels. So you're trimming. And is that the right way to think about it? And will you continue to trim to get to a lower ratio?\nSteve Spray: Mike, I'll tackle the first part of that. I can tell you that there is absolutely no change in our philosophy because of a new CEO. But I'll let Steve Soloria kind of dive into the details there for you.\nSteve Soloria: Mike, this is Steve Soloria. Again, I would agree with what you said. We view it as just standard prudent portfolio management. We were trying to be opportunistic. We will periodically trim or prune names in the portfolio for a variety of reasons, managing within our investment policy statement, evaluating stocks on a fundamental basis. And we felt that with that in mind, selling into a strong equity market on a couple of names that had run a bit was, again, opportunistic. And as we looked at that, we started to look at where to invest those funds. Where was the best opportunity? Was it rolling back into a hot market or maybe taking advantage of interest rates that this -- the window may be closing on higher rates. So we started to roll into those, again, opportunistically. And as we looked at that, we were looking at tax implications and what booking gains was going to do for us and trying to offset some of those losses. So it was kind of a perfect storm of several different factors that kind of drove us to the scale of where we were. But the typical activity is stuff that we do on a quarterly basis anyway. So we feel we'll revert back to a more normalized activity level.\nMichael Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful, Steve. And may be lastly, switching to the access and surplus lines segment. Just focusing specifically on the top line growth acceleration trend in recent quarters. I know there's historically been plenty of top line volatility in this segment, too, and it's a smaller segment, but is there a trend line we should be thinking of or something changing? Or I'm not saying we're going to run rate 23% top line growth. But I'm just curious if there's something underlying that we should be appreciating? Thanks.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, nothing changing there. We're about 90% casualty in our E&S space. You can get some inherent variability or volatility in E&S, just in general, as you mentioned, as you know, both with premium and with losses. If you lose a larger account or so that will put pressure quarter-to-quarter on that net written premium. But I would sum it up to you this way is that we're working on 12 years, again, of underwriting profit in our E&S company customary to the way we look at reserving throughout the entire company, we take prudent approach. We equipped to act when we see things. And as far as the growth goes, I would be consistent there as well. I think we're in a -- definitely in a favorable environment, but I think we can grow our E&S company through all environments. I think we're still just scratching the surface with what we can do from an excess and surplus line standpoint.\nMichael Zaremski : Is it worth elaborating on why do you think you discretion the surface? Is it just you, over time, get more data and can expand your underwriting appetite or hiring more folks or trying to understand that thing.\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think -- yes, yes, that's a good follow-up. I think it's all of the above. We continue to expand our expertise. We continue to expand the team. We continue to expand the products that we look at, we're adding more agencies across the entire company that favorably impacts our E&S company as well. So -- and when we look at the business that our agents write the amount of business that they placed in the E&S space, we can just see tremendous opportunity. And I think our business model the fact that we deal directly with the retail agents. We've got our own in-house brokerage. We can return more of the compensation directly to our agents. We have direct bill we handle claims with our own people. You get the point that I just think is an attractive model that we can continue to just expand.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. So kind of, I guess, building a little bit on Mike's question, but more importantly, some comments that you made talking about the generational opportunities for growth, I think, in personal lines. Can you give us some perspective on your view on what used to be when you're throwing all the new business on the \"new business penalty\" and attended both personal lines and commercial lines? Can you give us a sense of how the profile business has changed over the last couple of years? Or is it a geographic change or just some color on how the company is changing as it grows.\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think it's -- I think, yes, that book of business has evolved for sure. 10 years ago, we were 90%, what we would call middle-market personal lines. that now, that book has grown considerably, as you can see, and we're just under 60%, which would be considered private client or high net worth I think the reason I say once in the lifetime is just there's just so many macro things going on there, Greg, both in the middle market space, primarily around severe convective storm, I'd say, in the Midwest. Inflation hit that pretty hard as well. The traditional competitors that we had in that marketplace just seem to be disrupted. Our balance sheet strength allowed us to take advantage of that opportunity. I think one of the big strengths we have in personal lines today, and I'll talk about it a lot, is that we -- and this is our agents telling this. I think we are considered a premier market, both in the high net worth or private client and in middle market. One of the advantages to us is, obviously, with deep agency relationships, we can be a solution or being more important to each of them with being able to handle middle market and the high net worth I think, in a first-class way. Financially, it's giving us some diversification both by a line of business and geographically. High net worth or private client is typically it's property driven, less so auto, middle market, the exact opposite, auto driven more or less so on the home high net worth tends to be on the coast. We write it everywhere, but it tends to be coastal, middle market, more in the middle of the country. So we just think we're getting a nice mix and diversification across that entire segment. Now on the pricing, yes, I think it's the same confidence that I talked about with Mike on commercial lines. It's just we've got an experienced team with a ton of expertise in building these models across the entire business. New business penalty, I don't believe in a new business penalty, I think you've got to write every risk at the right rate on a risk-adjusted basis. And I'm just confident in where our pricing is going on a prospective basis. I hope that answers.\nGregory Peters: Yes, it does. It does. I mean one of the -- you were mentioning the opportunities with severe convective storms. You're talking about E&S. I just have this, I guess, this natural pivot that I think you're growing your exposures like in California, Texas and Florida, may be a little bit in the Northeast versus other areas of the country. But I guess that's what I was kind of thinking about because you talked about your losses to Milton, and it doesn't seem to be as large as, I guess, it could have potentially been but maybe your exposures are running in different areas of the state in Florida?\nSteve Spray: Yes. Our Florida new business in Personal Lines is down a little over $4 million year-over-year. But let me make sure I'm clear on that as well. It's not just the rate that we're driving, particularly in the middle market severe convective storm exposed property. Terms and conditions are probably equally as important there, whether it be wind inhale deductibles, ACV or roof schedules. And then when you speak specifically to E&S on the personal line side, Greg that is predominantly right now for us. That's California home. We've got our E&S capability up and running in 10-plus states, most of those coastal. But as an example, even in Florida, we're writing new business on an E&S basis. But we just haven't seen that -- we feel that the pricing the terms and conditions that we can get are as attractive as we would need. So we'll continue to be conservative there.\nGregory Peters: Fair enough. I just pivot to another company question on the agents. I view them as a critical strength of your company, the agent relationships. Can you talk to us as you look out to next year, what you think the growth of the agency force might look like or the appointments that you make in '25? Or do you have a target? Or how do you sort of approach that, please?\nSteve Spray: Yes. We're not making public. Greg, our goal for agencies for next year. What I can tell you is that we are committed to expanding that distribution. We think there's plenty of opportunity without \u201cdiluting the franchise\u201d. We will not -- this is kind of my thought, and this is the direction we're heading is we will not dilute the franchise by the number of agencies we appoint. What we have to focus on is making sure that we continue to do business with the most professional, and candidly, those who are most aligned just with the way we do business, locally fast, fair, handling business at the local level. You're right. The agency relationships are key to everything we do. I think it's our differentiator. It's something that we're going to continue to stay focused on doing business locally is a big piece of that. But you can expect us to continue to expand the distribution I would say, roughly at a clip that you've seen us this year and over the last couple of years.\nGregory Peters: Fair enough. Thank you for answering my questions.\nSteve Spray: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jing Li with KBW. Please go ahead.\nJing Li: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I just have a question on E&S unfavorable development. I know it's pretty small, but I appreciate if you can add some colors on that.\nSteve Spray: Jing, yes, the -- I think you were referring to the unfavorable development on the E&S casualty. And I would just say for you there. It's just that we saw case incurred losses that are emerging at amounts higher than we expected. Like I mentioned earlier, that business -- that book of business is 90% casualty, it's E&S. So it's got inherent volatility in it, inherent variability, but we've got a great track record of profitability in our E&S company. And we'll just continue to stay prudent like we always have company-wide with the reserves. So that's about all I'd have to add on unfavorable in the quarter for E&S.\nJing Li: Got it. Thank you. I have a follow-up on the personal auto and personal line. So the rate accelerated from high single digit to low double digit. Just curious about your view to reach rate adequacy. Do you think that you still need double digit for 2025 and beyond?\nSteve Spray: Yes. I wouldn't necessarily be able to give you, Jing the kind of run rate. All I can tell you is that we've still got a lot of rate earning into the book. And I think just with the -- all the things that we've talked about here, just with the changing weather patterns, I think there's still runway for rate across the entire personal lines book. We -- and I would say this, again, the key for us is looking at it prospectively, and we do feel on a prospective basis that our rates in personal lines are ahead of loss cost trends.\nJing Li: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Grace Carter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGrace Carter : Hi, everyone. I realize these are smaller segments, but the core loss ratio ticked up quite a bit versus recent history in both other commercial and other personal. So I was hoping that you could kind of give us an update on what you're seeing there? And if there's any sort of intra-year movement in there? And if it's just kind of related to some of the comments you've heard across the industry on pressure on long tail lines? Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Yes, Grace, thank you. You alluded to it. They're smaller premiums there. You're going to have -- I think it's just a lot of inherent variability or volatility in those lines. As an example, in personal lines, it could be a little watercraft that you're seeing there in our book. But we do a deep dive on every line of business on a regular basis. And there's nothing there that points us in the direction of anything to be concerned about as far as geographic or agency or line of business. So I think that's about all I'd have to add on that for you, Grace.\nGrace Carter: Okay. Thank you. And I guess I had another question on commercial casualty. I mean I think usually, you all have said that historically, you see the core loss ratio higher in core 1 or in quarter -- in the first quarter relative to the last three quarters of the year, just given higher uncertainty from the newness of the accident year I guess I'm just kind of trying to understand better like what exactly you all saw this quarter that resulted in Q3 kind of moving above Q1 and just kind of trying to think about if maybe a year-to-date number is the best way to think about sort of where we should see that trending going forward? Or just kind of any sort of color you can give on whether or not the Q3 level might be kind of the new run rate? Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Yes, Grace, you're absolutely right. We -- typically, every quarter that we get more data, more information, you just refine those picks even more. I think what you've got going on and commercial casualty is just the macro things that Mike alluded to earlier litigation costs up. The number of claims that are turning into litigation, social inflation, the legal system abuse, third-party litigation funding. It's all just really kind of in that line of business, industry-wide, I think, a little upside down. So I think that's why you're seeing that in the third quarter, it's just -- we're really trying to be prudent on that line of business just because the amount of uncertainty there has stayed pretty consistent. So as you know, we've got 30-plus years of favorable development. And we do that through a consistent process, consistent people and acting quickly when we see things that just cause us concern. But there's nothing specific in that third quarter other than, I would say, macro uncertainty.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Spray for any closing remarks.\nSteve Spray: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on the fourth quarter call. I hope everybody has a nice weekend.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We are pleased with our operating performance for the third quarter and first nine months of the year. Several metrics show the progress we are making as we work to provide value to shareholders over time and to deliver outstanding service to agencies and their clients through our dedicated associates. Our combined ratio continues to improve, absent the volatility caused by severe weather. While the devastation Hurricane Helene, in particular, inflicted on communities is heartbreaking, our claims associates are working tirelessly to deliver superior service with empathy and care. We had another quarter of strong premium growth, bolstered by improved pricing precision and risk segmentation by our underwriters on a policy-by-policy basis. In addition to another quarter with nice investment income growth, we executed investment portfolio rebalancing to a larger degree than a typical quarter. We believe that effort will produce both near-term and long-term financial benefits. Net income of $820 million for the third quarter of 2024 included recognition of $645 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held. Non-GAAP operating income of $224 million for the third quarter was down $37 million from a year ago, driven by an $86 million increase in after-tax catastrophe losses. Our 97.4% third quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 3.0 percentage points higher than the third quarter of last year and included an increase of 3.9 points for catastrophe losses. Our 86.8% accident year 2024 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 0.9 percentage points compared with accident year 2023 for the third quarter and was 0.8 points better on a nine-month basis. We had another quarter of what we believe is profitable premium growth. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance again produced a robust amount of new business for us and we continue to appoint agencies where we identify appropriate expansion opportunities. Our underwriters use pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases along with careful risk selection to help improve our underwriting profitability. Estimated average renewal price increases for the third quarter improved incrementally compared with the second quarter of this year. Commercial lines moved a little higher in this high single-digit percentage range and excess and surplus lines remained in the high single-digit range. Our personal line segment also moved a little higher with personal auto in the low double-digit range and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 17% for the quarter, including 16% growth in agency renewal premiums and 30% in new business premiums. As I next comment on performance by insurance segment, I'll focus on third quarter premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial lines grew net written premiums 11%, with an excellent 93.0% combined ratio that improved by 2.2 percentage points, including 1.3 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 29%, including growth in middle market accounts and Cincinnati private client business for our agency's high network clients. Its combined ratio was 110.3%, 10.4 percentage points higher than last year, driven by an increase of 12.7 points from higher catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 23%, with a combined ratio of 95.3%. While that's still quite profitable, it's less so than a year ago due to higher catastrophe losses and a modest amount of unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years. Both Cincinnati REIT and Cincinnati Global were again profitable and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati REIT grew third quarter 2024 net written premiums 5% and had a 95.6% combined ratio, bringing its nine-month combined ratio to a very profitable 81.5%. The $38 million of catastrophe losses Cincinnati REIT reported for the quarter included approximately $19 million for Hurricane Helene. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was an outstanding 66.6% for the third quarter, with 12% growth in net written premiums. Our life insurance subsidiary had another profitable quarter, including net income of $20 million and term life insurance earned premium growth of 4%. Before I close my prepared remarks, I'd like to briefly comment on the estimated effects of Hurricane Milton on fourth quarter results. While it is still early, we estimate our pre-tax incurred losses will total between $75 million and $125 million, net of any applicable reinsurance recoveries. Catastrophe losses for direct business written by the Cincinnati Insurance Company represents less than $15 million of that estimate while Cincinnati REIT represents more than half. Now, I'll conclude as usual with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our third quarter 2024 VCR was 9.0%, bringing the nine-month total to an excellent 17.8%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 1.7%, higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 7.3%. Next, Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell will highlight some additional aspects of our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. The momentum we have right now is powerful. As we put the finishing touches on department plans for next year, you can feel the excitement and see the opportunities that lie ahead in all corners of the company. Agents Echo that feeling as they comment on their appreciation for our ability to deliver stability, consistency, and financial strength, giving them a first-class carrier to support their most well-managed accounts. Last week, Fitch Ratings Agency agreed, affirming our current financial strength ratings and revising our outlook to positive from stable based on our sustained track record of profitability and proven financial strength. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Soloria, Mark Schambow, and Teresa Hopper. Betsy, please open the call for questions. Yes, thanks, Mike. Mike Sewell is going to go ahead and tackle this, and then I may add some commentary at the end. Yes, I think, yes, Mike, the pricing there just remains strong. Everything that Mike said, I'd probably focus from the pricing standpoint, just the uncertainty around social inflation, legal system abuse, however you want to title that, but just uncertainty in general. I think the key with us, and I always go back to this, one, we're a package writer. We don't write monoline business. And two, our underwriters, whether they're in the field or here in headquarters, are just tackling these accounts risk by risk. One by one, they're using the art of underwriting that we've all grown up with, and then the science. I think we're kind of at a nice spot intersection there.

And currently, as we disclosed, we're getting high single digits in the casualty, but again, that's that point estimate. You really have to look at the -- just kind of the -- that average doesn't tell the whole story. You got to look at the whole book, and there's a fair amount of our book that we would consider price adequate, and then in various levels and tranches where we need more rate. Yes. Mike, let me -- this is Steve again. Let me try that and then give me a follow-up. First of all, overarching, we feel good about our pricing.

We've got $13.8 billion of GAAP equity now supporting a little more than $9 billion of premium. I think that puts us in an enviable position. We -- as you know, our deep relationships with our agents we are regularly communicating with them. And I can tell you that the feedback we get from them is one of the appreciation for our consistency, our stability, our financial strength.

In Personal Lines, we're -- I've talked about this in the past, too. I think we're in a once in a lifetime, once in a generation, however you'd like to put it, you could call it hard market, I look at it as a market opportunity. And we -- our ex cat there continues to improve. We're not just -- that doesn't make us happy. We got to pay cat dollars with real money.

So just feel good about, again, all lines of business and all segments. I hope that answers it. Mike, I'll tackle the first part of that. I can tell you that there is absolutely no change in our philosophy because of a new CEO. But I'll let Steve Soloria kind of dive into the details there for you. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, nothing changing there. We're about 90% casualty in our E&S space. You can get some inherent variability or volatility in E&S, just in general, as you mentioned, as you know, both with premium and with losses. If you lose a larger account or so that will put pressure quarter-to-quarter on that net written premium.

I think we're in a -- definitely in a favorable environment, but I think we can grow our E&S company through all environments. I think we're still just scratching the surface with what we can do from an excess and surplus line standpoint. Yes. I think -- yes, yes, that's a good follow-up. I think it's all of the above. We continue to expand our expertise. We continue to expand the team. We continue to expand the products that we look at, we're adding more agencies across the entire company that favorably impacts our E&S company as well. So -- and when we look at the business that our agents write the amount of business that they placed in the E&S space, we can just see tremendous opportunity.

It's just we've got an experienced team with a ton of expertise in building these models across the entire business. New business penalty, I don't believe in a new business penalty, I think you've got to write every risk at the right rate on a risk-adjusted basis. And I'm just confident in where our pricing is going on a prospective basis. I hope that answers. Yes. Our Florida new business in Personal Lines is down a little over $4 million year-over-year. But let me make sure I'm clear on that as well. It's not just the rate that we're driving, particularly in the middle market severe convective storm exposed property. Terms and conditions are probably equally as important there, whether it be wind inhale deductibles, ACV or roof schedules. And then when you speak specifically to E&S on the personal line side, Greg that is predominantly right now for us. That's California home. We've got our E&S capability up and running in 10-plus states, most of those coastal. But as an example, even in Florida, we're writing new business on an E&S basis. But we just haven't seen that -- we feel that the pricing the terms and conditions that we can get are as attractive as we would need. So we'll continue to be conservative there. Yes. We're not making public. Greg, our goal for agencies for next year. What I can tell you is that we are committed to expanding that distribution. We think there's plenty of opportunity without \u201cdiluting the franchise\u201d. We will not -- this is kind of my thought, and this is the direction we're heading is we will not dilute the franchise by the number of agencies we appoint. What we have to focus on is making sure that we continue to do business with the most professional, and candidly, those who are most aligned just with the way we do business, locally fast, fair, handling business at the local level. You're right. The agency relationships are key to everything we do. I think it's our differentiator. It's something that we're going to continue to stay focused on doing business locally is a big piece of that. But you can expect us to continue to expand the distribution I would say, roughly at a clip that you've seen us this year and over the last couple of years. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for the questions. Jing, yes, the -- I think you were referring to the unfavorable development on the E&S casualty. And I would just say for you there. It's just that we saw case incurred losses that are emerging at amounts higher than we expected. Like I mentioned earlier, that business -- that book of business is 90% casualty, it's E&S. So it's got inherent volatility in it, inherent variability, but we've got a great track record of profitability in our E&S company. And we'll just continue to stay prudent like we always have company-wide with the reserves. So that's about all I'd have to add on unfavorable in the quarter for E&S. Yes. I wouldn't necessarily be able to give you, Jing the kind of run rate. All I can tell you is that we've still got a lot of rate earning into the book. And I think just with the -- all the things that we've talked about here, just with the changing weather patterns, I think there's still runway for rate across the entire personal lines book. We -- and I would say this, again, the key for us is looking at it prospectively, and we do feel on a prospective basis that our rates in personal lines are ahead of loss cost trends. Yes, Grace, thank you. You alluded to it. They're smaller premiums there. You're going to have -- I think it's just a lot of inherent variability or volatility in those lines. As an example, in personal lines, it could be a little watercraft that you're seeing there in our book. But we do a deep dive on every line of business on a regular basis. And there's nothing there that points us in the direction of anything to be concerned about as far as geographic or agency or line of business. So I think that's about all I'd have to add on that for you, Grace. Yes, Grace, you're absolutely right. We -- typically, every quarter that we get more data, more information, you just refine those picks even more. I think what you've got going on and commercial casualty is just the macro things that Mike alluded to earlier litigation costs up. The number of claims that are turning into litigation, social inflation, the legal system abuse, third-party litigation funding. It's all just really kind of in that line of business, industry-wide, I think, a little upside down. So I think that's why you're seeing that in the third quarter, it's just -- we're really trying to be prudent on that line of business just because the amount of uncertainty there has stayed pretty consistent. So as you know, we've got 30-plus years of favorable development. And we do that through a consistent process, consistent people and acting quickly when we see things that just cause us concern. But there's nothing specific in that third quarter other than, I would say, macro uncertainty. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on the fourth quarter call. I hope everybody has a nice weekend."

            "content": "Mike, this is Steve Soloria. Again, I would agree with what you said. We view it as just standard prudent portfolio management. We were trying to be opportunistic. We will periodically trim or prune names in the portfolio for a variety of reasons, managing within our investment policy statement, evaluating stocks on a fundamental basis. And we felt that with that in mind, selling into a strong equity market on a couple of names that had run a bit was, again, opportunistic. And as we looked at that, we started to look at where to invest those funds. Where was the best opportunity? Was it rolling back into a hot market or maybe taking advantage of interest rates that this -- the window may be closing on higher rates. So we started to roll into those, again, opportunistically. And as we looked at that, we were looking at tax implications and what booking gains was going to do for us and trying to offset some of those losses. So it was kind of a perfect storm of several different factors that kind of drove us to the scale of where we were. But the typical activity is stuff that we do on a quarterly basis anyway. So we feel we'll revert back to a more normalized activity level."

            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income had another round of strong growth, up 15% for the third quarter of \u201824, compared with the same quarter in \u201823. Dividend income was down 1%, reflecting $959 million of net sales of equity securities during the third quarter, primarily from some portfolio rebalancing through trimming or exiting positions of seven common stocks among our 63 holdings at the beginning of the quarter. As Steve mentioned in our news release, this does not represent a change in our investment approach of holding a significant amount of equities as we work to balance near-term income generation with long-term book value growth. The large cash balance generated during the third quarter has been reduced and should continue to decline with additional bond purchases during the remainder of the year. Bond interest income grew 21% for the third quarter of this year. Net purchases of fixed maturity securities totaled $672 million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year. The third quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.8% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 36 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the third quarter of this year was 5.53%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the third quarter were favorable for both our equity portfolio and our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $841 million for the equity portfolio and $411 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the third quarter, the total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $7.3 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.5 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $203 million. Cash flow, in addition to higher bond yields, again, boosted investment income growth. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2024 reached $2 billion, up 36% from a year ago. I'll briefly comment on expense management and our efforts to balance expense control with strategic business investments. The third quarter 2024 property casualty underlying expense ratio decrease of 0.2 percentage points was largely due to lower levels of profit sharing commissions for agencies. Moving on to loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarially estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first nine months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss and loss expense reserves was $963 million, including $917 million for the IB&R portion. During the third quarter, we experienced $71 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 3.2 percentage points. For commercial casualty line of business, there was no material reserve development for any prior accident year during the quarter. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first nine months of \u201824 included favorable $326 million for \u201823, favorable $55 million for \u201822, favorable $10 million for \u201821, and an unfavorable $180 million in aggregate for accident years prior to \u201821. My final comments pertain to capital management. During the first nine months of 2024, we returned capital to shareholders through $365 million of dividends paid and nearly 1.1 million shares repurchased at an average price of approximately $112 per share. Earlier this month, another dividend was paid, returning another $120 million or so to shareholders. That payment completed the company's 64th consecutive year of increasing shareholder dividends, a streak we believe is matched by only seven other publicly traded companies based in the United States. We believe our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in stellar condition. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end exceeded $5 billion. Debt to total capital remained under 10%. And our quarter end book value was at a record high, $88.32 per share with nearly $14 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations. Now I'll turn the call back over to Steve. No, I appreciate it, and thanks for the question. So, yes, as you already noted, there was no prior accident year that had a material development during this quarter. So, recent quarters, we've added to or we've slowed the release of IBNR reserves as we've reacted to lost payments and case reserve increases that were higher than expected for some accident years related to the commercial casualty line. There has been some higher case incurred losses that were spread across several accident years that was more severity than frequency. But, as you're probably looking at page 9 of the supplement and you're seeing the loss pick being elevated a little bit, it's really, Mike, it's just related to prudent case reserves or prudent reserves that we're adding. There's a lot of uncertainty there. You're seeing a lot of things in the industry that's out there. If I were to take a look at the nine-month compared to nine-month for that loss pick, you're really only about two full points higher. We are adding to the IBNR you've seen that on page 11 of the supplement, and you'll see that the commercial casualty is the largest area that we're adding IBNR. So, that's probably a lot of information, but, yes, that's the background. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Cincinnati Financial Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello. This is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results, along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the quarterly results link in the navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Spray, and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating in the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including Executive Chairman, Steve Johnson, Chief Investment Officer Steve Soloria, and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer Mark Schambow, and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Teresa Hopper. Please note that some of these matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and, therefore, does not reconcile the GAAP. Now, I'll turn over the call to Steve.\nSteve Spray: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had a good quarter and first half of the year. In addition to our strong financial performance, recent travel to meet with agents reinforced my excitement about the future. Agents are quite enthusiastic about doing business with us, citing our responsiveness as we answer the call, both literally and figuratively, to help them navigate this challenging insurance market. While picking up the phone is part of our culture, the confidence we have in our expertise and Cincinnati's financial strength lets us continue growing profitably, delivering insurance solutions for our agents and their best clients. Net income of $312 million for the second quarter of 2024 included recognition of $112 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held. Non-GAAP operating income of $204 million for the second quarter was up $13 million from a year ago. Investment income continued to grow nicely and contributed $17 million of the increase. The 98.5% second quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than the second quarter of last year and included a decrease of 0.8 points for catastrophe losses. That brought the first half combined ratio to 96.1%. A nice place to be as we head into the second half of the year. Typically, the end of the year tends to be better than the beginning, in part due to the catastrophe loss ratio averaging about two points better in the second half based on the past 10 years. Our 88.2% accident year 2024 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 2.2 percentage points compared with accident year 2023 for the second quarter. It was 0.7 points better on a six-month basis. Once again, overall reserve development of prior accident years was favorable. Although it was 3.6 points lower than a year ago, as we continue to consider uncertainty regarding ultimate losses and remain prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We are entering the second half of the year with confidence and optimism. In addition to improved accident year results and an overall combined ratio for the first half of 2024 that was better than last year's first half, we are pleased with other measures regarding our operating performance. We had strong second quarter premium growth and believe it is profitable growth. We continue to use pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases along with careful risk selection to help improve our underwriting profitability. Those efforts, plus others, are bolstering our progress in managing elevated inflation effects on insured losses. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance produced another quarter of profitable business for us and we continue to appoint additional agencies where we see appropriate expansion opportunities. Our underwriters continue to do excellent work as they emphasize retaining profitable accounts and managing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing based on our risk selection and pricing expertise. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were again at healthy levels with commercial lines near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, excess and surplus lines in the high single-digit range, personal auto in the low double-digit range, and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 14% for the quarter, including 12% growth in agency renewal premiums and 34% in new business premiums. Next, I'll briefly highlight operating performance by insured segment, focusing on second quarter premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial lines grew net written premiums 7% for the second quarter with a 99.1% combined ratio that increased by 2.2 percentage points and included prior accident year reserve development that was less favorable by 2.9 points. Personal lines grew net written premiums 30%, including growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati private client business for our agency's high net worth clients. Its combined ratio was 106.9%, 0.7% percentage points better than last year, despite an increase of 1.2 points from higher catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 15% and was also profitable with a combined ratio of 95.4%, up 3.2 percentage points from second quarter a year ago due to unfavorable reserve development. Both Cincinnati REIT and Cincinnati Global were again very profitable and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati REIT's combined ratio for the second quarter of 2024 was an excellent 70.1%. It grew net written premiums by 17%, bringing the overall six-month written premium for 2024 in line with 2023. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 63.2%. While it grew net written premiums 2% for the first half of the year, second quarter premiums were down 18%, reflecting pricing discipline in a very competitive market. Our life insurance subsidiary had an outstanding quarter, including net income of $24 million and operating income growth of 26%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our second quarter, 2024 VCR, was 2.2%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 1.6%. Our overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 0.6%. Now Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell will add his comments to highlight other parts of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Investment income continued to grow up 10% for the second quarter of 2024 compared with the same quarter in 2023. Dividend income was down 1% or $1 million for the quarter, primarily due to two unusual items that totaled approximately $2 million. One was a holding with a June x dividend date in 2023 that moved to July 1st in 2024. The other was a holding that reduced its dividend rate by 53% after a spinoff transaction. Bond interest income grew 18% for the second quarter of this year. We again added fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $771 million for the first six months of the year. The second quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.64% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 30 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2024 was 6.06%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the second quarter of 2024 were favorable for our equity portfolio and unfavorable for our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $149 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net loss of $93 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.4 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $700 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income in addition to higher bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for the first six months of 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 33% from a year ago. I'll move on to expense management, where we always work to balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The second quarter of 2024 property casualty underlying expense ratio was 0.5% points higher than last year, reflecting higher levels of profit sharing commissions for agencies in employee-related expenses. Next, let me comment on lost reserves, where our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actually estimated range of net loss and lost expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves. Then, we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first six months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss expense reserves was $578 million, including $506 million for the IB&R portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $40 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 1.9 percentage points. The commercial line segment saw overall favorable reserve development of $29 million, driven by workers' compensation and commercial property, which more than offset the unfavorable development in commercial casualty. Commercial casualty was again the line of business having the largest amount of unfavorable reserve development, with a total of $28 million for the quarter, or less than 1% of that line's year-end 2023 reserve balance. We released reserves in some recent accident years and added reserves totaling $51 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2021, including $30 million for 2018 through 2020, due to case incurred losses emerging at amounts higher than we expected. The unfavorable amounts reflects our slowing the release of IB&R reserves for some of those older accident years while adding to others. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first six months of 2024 included favorable $269 million for 2023, favorable $36 million for 2022, favorable $17 million for 2021, and an unfavorable $182 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2021, with commercial casualty representing $167 million of the unfavorable $182 million. I'll conclude my comments with the capital management highlights, another area where we have a consistent long-term approach. We paid $125 million in dividends to shareholders during the second quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 395,000 shares, an average price per share of $116.33. We think our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital contributed continued to be under 10%. And our quarter end book value was at a record high, $81.79 per share, with $12.8 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Spray: Thanks, Mike. Before we move on to questions, I'd like to share some additional observations based on my first few months as CEO. I've spoken with many of our agents and associates, and they share my high level of confidence in the future of this company. In the first six months of this year, we've achieved a combined ratio of 96.1%. That makes 12.5 consecutive years of underwriting profit. A core loss ratio that continues to improve. Growth in net written premiums of 14%, with investment income up 13%. We've set the stage for 64 years of increasing dividends to shareholders. In the most challenging market of my career, our balance sheet allows us to lean in and grow with our agents. And I'm really excited about where we're headed. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Soloria, Mark Schambow, and Teresa Hopper. Jason, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Phillips from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips: I want to make sure, Mike, on your comments, I guess it flowed pretty quickly. I want to make sure I got the [indiscernible] right. I wasn't clear. The commercial casualty, when you were talking about releasing the recent action years and added 51 for 2021 and prior, was that commercial casualty or was that all lines?\nSteve Spray: That was for -- thank you for the question. That was for commercial casualty only.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. So, your ad sounds like it's more for those 2020, 2021, and prior, correct, for that line?\nSteve Spray: That is exactly correct.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. And that's similar, I think, in 4Q. You took a bigger charge for the same -- I don't know the exact same action years, but again, for the prior years, not so much for the recent ones.\nSteve Spray: That's correct. Okay.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. So I guess you're not seeing so far, or maybe you don't think you ever will, kind of what we're seeing from some others so far this quarter of 2020 subsequent is starting to become a problem. You're not seeing that, and maybe tell us why you think you won't control it?\nSteve Spray: Well, this is Steve, Mike. First of all, I would just say, from my perspective, overall, there always seems to be movement in prior accident year losses. Some develop better than expected, sometimes higher than expected, as you know. It can be different by segment, line of business, and certainly accident years. It's, as you know, reserving is not a perfect science. That being said, couldn't be more confident in our process and the experience team that we have that are setting those reserves and taking the approach that we do. Comfortable with management's best estimate of ultimate losses here at the end of the second quarter. We've always had a track record, a long history of overall favorable development on a line basis. And in these most recent accident years, in any most recent accident year, I feel like we've always been very prudent in realizing there's not as much data there and just recognizing the uncertainty. And I think that uncertainty is still there. It's always going to be there in those most recent accident years. But I think our actuaries, they look at that and they take it into account. And I think one of the other benefits is that we're all here in one building. I think that's something that sometimes gets underestimated is that we're all here and we are talking literally multiple times a day with pricing actuaries, with the reserving actuaries, and then with the business years. And I think we're quick to act to things that we see on reserving, and we're just as quick to act when we see things in underwriting. Commercial umbrella, I'm really peeling it back here now, Mike, but, commercial umbrella, we noticed in the second quarter of '22, if you recall, just some unfavorable results there. Our actuaries were quick to act and take the appropriate action on the reserves, and then our underwriting was just as quick to act as well. And we reduced limits. We took terms and conditions action based on the fleet size, let's say, on the auto, certain classes of business, certain jurisdictions, and I think we jumped all over that. And now through six months of this year, commercial umbrella is running in the mid-90s, and things are looking very favorable there as well.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Steve, thank you for all that. That's helpful. I guess the second question then is staying with commercial casualty. It looks like your comments on kind of the renewal pricing for that line from 1Q to 2Q are about the same, like you said, around high single digits. I just want to confirm that, and maybe anything you want to share on kind of directionally for commercial casualty in the recent quarters, how things might be moving around.\nSteve Spray: Yes, Mike. The high single digit on commercial casualty is correct, and that was consistent from the first quarter. I would say the commercial market -- we're a package writer, and the commercial marketplace, I would say, is rational and orderly. But my view is we still see runway for increased rate in the commercial marketplace. Now, the other thing I always have a caveat there is what we're really executing on and focusing here at the company at Cincinnati is segmentation and pricing these risks, risk by risk. And just the tools that we have, the predictive analytics we use to price the product is -- the average just doesn't tell the full story, as you can understand. And just the underwriting teams are just executing excellent on our segmentation strategy.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, Steve. Thank you. Congrats, and congrats on your first quarter at the helm. I appreciate it.\nSteve Spray: Yes, thank you, Mike. Much appreciated.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGregory Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. I guess sort of building on the commentary on pricing and casualty. I'm just curious about how you view your competitive positioning from a price perspective in the broader commercial book of business. It seems like the growth rates are beginning or have moderated except for perhaps property. So any added perspective on that would be insightful.\nSteve Spray: Yes. I think, again, Greg, I think I've got this right on your question, but, insurance from our perspective is a local business, and it varies by state. It varies by size of account. Like I said, we're a package underwriter. We compete with national carriers. We compete with the small regional mutuals. And where our real focus is, is just focusing on what we do and building those deep relationships with those local agents. And when we're showing up, and like I said in my opening remarks, when we answer the call, we're confident in our risk selection, confident in our ability to price that product, and we're confident in the relationships we have with our agents because we've built those deep relationships that I don't worry about growth. We're continuing to appoint new agencies across the country. Like I said, when we see opportunity, we'll continue to do that going forward. But, it's all about the discipline and the risk selection and the pricing, and then we let it come to us. If you look at new business and commercial lines through the first half, up over 30%. The first half of last year, we were down considerably. Our risk selection and our pricing has not changed. What's changed is the environment that we're operating in, and those risks came to us. We didn't change our pricing discipline one bit, and the beauty is, is we can see that risk by risk, line by line.\nGregory Peters: Yes, fair enough. Pivot to and I know you provided some detail in your opening remarks. I'm focused on the expense ratio. That was up, I think there are some commission pressures, or maybe you can just go back and talk to us about the moving parts inside the expense ratio, and is the current level maybe on a six-month basis sort of the run rate we should think about going forward, or are there some unusual non-recurring items inside there that we should exclude?\nMike Sewell: Greg, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. On a year-to-date basis, as I mentioned, it did go up a little bit. Our combined ratio for the year was down a little bit, so the profit-sharing commission for the agencies, does go up, as we do invest for the future with hiring folks and so forth and other items, employee-related expenses is up a little bit. But when I look down the line, I do see where total dollars are going up, but, the rate of our earned premiums are outpacing the expenses as they increase, which is what I'm trying to do, what we're trying to do. So I think we're making good progress. I look at some of the expense categories, and actually they're down a little bit on a percentage, even though total dollars are up. So, seeing it right now at the 30.1 on a year-to-date basis, as we've been saying over the years, we've been trying to get below a 30, and so we're going to keep doing that. But, right now it's a little bit elevated probably from where I'd like it to be for all the right reasons of really paying the commissions to the agencies.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the answers. Congratulations on your first quarter. Out of the gate, Steve.\nSteve Spray: Thank you very much, Greg. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Lederer from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nCharles Lederer: I guess, can you talk about how mature those pre-2021 accident years for general liability are at this point?\nMikeSewell: Can you repeat that question again, please?\nCharles Lederer: Yes. I guess, how mature are those accident years, like the 2018 to '20 accident years, in your guys' view? If you could give color around that.\nMikeSewell: Yes. I think we feel really good about the reserves. And first of all, the overall reserves with where we're at, but it was the 2020 to 2018 years that I mentioned the $30 million that was unfavorable versus the more recent accident years. If I think about the commercial casualty reserves and some of the things that actually makes me feel pretty good about it, when you look at the first six months of this year, we have been increasing our IBNR ratio, which I think we've kind of indicated. And so, for commercial casualty, we're about 10 percentage points higher of what we're adding for IBNR currently than when we were at the pre-pandemic full years of 2017 through 2019. So, just having the extra 10 percentage points, I think that's paying off for us. If I do look at through the end of the second quarter, our incurred loss, loss adjustment expense ratio, on average, if I take the '22, '23 year for commercial casualty, those picks are a little bit higher than those pre-pandemic years of 2017 through 2019. So, I think our ultimate picks are higher. And then, I think Steve mentioned it, with the confidence I think that we all have, with our process and so forth. If I look back over the last 15 years, I probably could have kept going. I think my spreadsheet was running out, but there was only two commercial casualty accident years that have not developed favorably during that time period from the original estimated ultimate picks at 12 months. So, I'm very confident as Steve is, with our process, the people doing it, et cetera, et cetera. So, I hope that's the color that you're looking for.\nCharles Lederer: That's helpful. When you talked about the 10 points higher of IBNR, that's for all lines? Just want to make sure I understand. Not all lines, all accident years?\nMike Sewell: That is actually, that is for the commercial casualty when I'm looking at that by accident year or calendar year.\nCharles Lederer: Okay. Yes. So, for all accident years. Okay. I guess on the personal line side, can you talk about, I guess, the divergence in, I guess, new business or can you bifurcate the new business trend and personal lines between middle market and high net worth? I know both were strong, but there's a lot of weight there. So, just curious.\nSteve Spray: Yes. It moves around a little bit, Charlie, but right now, both are growing, as you can see, both are growing in a very healthy manner. Right now, middle market is outpacing high net worth a little bit or private client a little bit. That bounces around from quarter-to-quarter. We're also growing our E&S personal lines opportunity. I think the real key, from my perspective and from all of our perspectives, is that we have become, for our agents, a premier rider of personal lines, both in middle market and in private client or high net worth. And that just gives our agents a tremendous amount of confidence. We can be a solution for a bigger percentage of their business. We've got the sophisticated pricing that we need in the middle market for the comparative radar world. And then we've got the expertise in the private client. Now you add an E&S option where we can provide capacity for our agents and the insureds in their communities. And I've never seen a personal lines market like this. I think it's generational. And I think we are really taking advantage of the opportunity to, again, help our agents and help the policy holders in their community. We are open for business. We're confident in our pricing on a prospective basis, which is the way we always look at it. We've got a great leadership team. We've got tremendous expertise throughout the organization. So I really believe that the personal lines right now is transformational for Cincinnati Insurance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from BMO. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Taking those personal lines, and hopefully you appreciate it. I'm an analyst, so I focus on more of the negative than positive sometimes. But personal auto, the margins, there was some PYB there. Anything notable that's in personal auto we should think about?\nSteve Spray: Mike, thanks for the question. I've always found you to be extremely positive. Obviously, personal auto, short tail line, the adverse development that you're seeing there is all in bodily injury. Our physical damage in personal auto is performing very well. I will say again, short tail line, the vast majority of that adverse development is in accident year 2023, and there's a little bit in the 2022. And if you think about this as well, we are a market for middle market and high net worth, like I was saying. But as our high net worth book continues to grow and be a bigger portion of our overall personal lines business, we're getting all kinds of diversification, positive effects from that. And one of those is in personal auto. When you have high net worth, it's driven by property and less so by auto. Middle market, more driven by auto and less in the property piece. So that mix is shifting as well. And I think you're seeing that in a favorable way in our overall results. We continue to get, we've had rate early into that book, that personal auto book for quite some time now, and that continues into 2024. And I don't see an end in sight of rate coming into that book either.\nMike Zaremski: That's helpful. Switching gears to workers' comp, we know, we can see that [indiscernible] underweight comp and probably for a couple of reasons, I don't think we have to elaborate on it, but the results are fairly tremendous. I don't know if you want to comment on what's going on there this quarter or this year-to-date, actually. I know the market is soft from a pricing perspective, but what would you be waiting for, maybe patiently, to say we want to maybe start leaning into workers' comp in a growth way?\nMike Sewell: Yes. Thanks, Mike. We have a strong appetite for workers' comp. 10 or 12 years ago, we really got serious about all levels of comp, claims, loss control, risk selection, especially pricing. We are looking to grow comp when we think that we can get the right rate on a risk-adjusted basis, and you're right. I thought that this deterioration in rate would show up more so in the results, quite frankly, several years ago, and it hasn't. But I think it's such a long tail line, and it historically has such volatility to it. We just think being prudent in our risk selection and our pricing there and not to chase that is a prudent thing to do for the long-term. And when we can write work comp at the right rate today on business that we like, we're writing it, and we're looking for it, and we're talking to our agents about it. It's just we just don't see the rate environment right now as attractive. Again, I understand it's performing well on a calendar year basis, but we just think over the long pull, being extra vigilant on workers' compensation is prudent.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. Sticking quickly on comp, one of your peers who also has a disproportionate amount of trade construction exposure in different regions, but you all have very strong practice there too, has said that they're seeing a bit of a change in comp frequency. I don't know if it's curious to throw it out there if you all are seeing any of that as well in your portfolio.\nSteve Spray: No, Mike, I can't say that we've seen that. We've been pretty stable on that front.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And I guess just lastly, you might have covered some of this, but on the overall commercial lines, marketplace competitiveness, I know pricing has been kind of flattish in a quarter or for a number of quarters now. Do you all sense that the marketplace is kind of stable at current rates, or do you sense that there's kind of a bit of an upwards trajectory to kind of the pricing environment, or downwards?\nSteve Spray: Yes. No. Mike, as far as the rate environment, we've been stacking quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter of additional rate throughout every major line in commercial lines, except for workers' compensation. But I would say that the commercial market, and again, it all depends on size of the account. It depends on the state that you're in. But just generally speaking, I would characterize the commercial marketplace as responsible and orderly. There are moving parts. You see it in other carriers' reports. There's uncertainty out there. And I think that uncertainty has certainly promoted the continued rate that you're seeing across all lines in commercial lines. And I don't see a softening market in commercial lines. You'll hear little pockets of different things, different lines of business, maybe a different class here and there. But just generally speaking, all lines, all classes, countrywide, I think from Cincinnati's perspective, it's orderly and rational.\nOperator: The next question comes from Grace Carter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGrace Carter: Looking at the commercial auto line for the past few quarters in a row, there's been a favorable year-over-year change in the underlying loss ratio as well as modest reserve releases. I was just wondering where you all think that line stands since it's been such a difficult line for the industry over the past several years, and if you feel like the worst of the challenges are in the past now. And just trying to consider any sort of maybe differences in experience in the primary auto liability versus maybe what you've seen in the umbrella lines. Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Thank you, Grace, and good morning. Yes, commercial auto is, we feel, again, feel really good about where we are there. You look back into 2016 and 2017, and we were having some real challenges in commercial auto. It's kind of the same story I was talking about with umbrella earlier. We recognized it, our actuaries acted upon it quickly, and we reacted very quickly. Personally, I think maybe a little ahead of the market on commercial auto. We got it in a good spot, but then we hit the pandemic, and inflation did what it did. And so we had to get some more rate in that book to keep up with inflation. But that commercial auto book was in good shape, quite frankly, from the actions we took in 2016 and 2017. And I think it also -- to really answer your question too, kind of peel that back, is if you look at the mix that we write at Cincinnati, one of the analysts just a minute ago mentioned, there's a construction book. We've got a manufacturing, retail, wholesale. We're not big into trucking or transportation risks. I think you see a lot more volatility there. We've just managed that book, I think, really well and feel really good about where we are with it today. So I think it's risk selection. I think it's just the makeup of our book. We're a package writer. We don't write motor auto. We don't write trucking or transportation. And I think that's what you're seeing.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And, in the 10-Q, I think the walk year-over-year for the E&S underlying loss ratio mentioned a decrease in the contribution from IBNR and an increase in the case incurred. I think that that's a bit different than what we've seen in the other segments. Could you go over maybe what's going on there and why it would look different than the other segments? Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Grace, I'm sorry. You were coming in and out there. I apologize. Could you restate that?\nGrace Carter: Yes, sure. In the 10-Q, when it talks about the walk and the underlying loss ratio in E&S, year-over-year it mentions a decrease in IBNR and increase in case incurred. I think that that was different than what it mentioned for the other segments. Could you just go over kind of the elements as to why that looks different relative to the other segments? Thank you.\nSteve Spray: I think, Grace, what I think, if I'm answering you correctly here, is we're looking at all the data. We're looking at paid. We're looking at case. We're looking at things that are happening inside the book for management views of the actuaries. And there's going to be noise quarter-to-quarter. I think looking at it over a longer period, 12 months or maybe even a little longer, will probably be more obstructive. And I hope I answered that for you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: I'm going to apologize for being an analyst also, but by that I mean just like an overexposure to publicly traded companies. Can you update us on how the non-public regionals that you compete with are responding to elevated social inflation and elevated property losses and what opportunity that implies for growth?\nSteve Spray: Yes. Thanks, Meyer. I would say from my perspective, I just don't, and this might sound kind of crazy, I just don't pay a lot of attention to what others are doing around us. I'm more focused on what we're doing risk-by-risk, town-by-town, agent-by-agent, and how we compete. And sometimes we run into situations where we lose this account, or we write this account. So I think it would be too broad to generalize. I would say to you this, on personal lines, we're seeing more tumultuous time from all those markets, particularly here in the Midwest. And we're seeing more and more opportunities in the middle market personal line space just on an exponential basis. Just the number of quotes and the opportunities that we're seeing is just up considerably and there's something to that. And I think a big piece of that is that we've got the balance sheet. Like I mentioned in my comments earlier, we're showing up to the agencies with 12.7 billion of GAAP equity looking to grow. Our doors are open. We're confident in the way we price that business. The terms and conditions that we're putting on homeowner business are as strong today as I've ever seen them in my career. And I think that they'll stay, particularly, wind and hail deductibles, roof schedules to combat the continued severe convective storms. And I think those things, along with re-insurance, are putting pressure on some of those markets that you mentioned and it's creating opportunity for Cincinnati.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. Related question. How do we think about the opportunity to appoint agents eventually impacting the value that agents see in the brand? Is there a point where that becomes diluted?\nSteve Spray: Thank you. I would say no. I would say the key and the key message that I'm sending and that we're executing on, and we're doing an excellent job of this, is with Cincinnati, it's more about the quality of the agent and the professionalism of the local agent that we're doing business with than it is about the numbers. Now, we want to do business with as few agents as possible, but as many as necessary. We've got roughly 2,100 agency relationships across the country. By any measure, that is extremely exclusive as far as distribution goes. I'm not saying this is a goal at all, but if we doubled our distribution on a relative basis, we would still have an exclusive contract compared to any of our peers that I can see in the industry. And again, I'm not saying we're doubling our agency plan, but I am telling you that we have plenty of opportunity to continue to appoint professional agents across the country, and you'll see us continue to do that. I can show you areas here in Ohio. If you looked at the number of agencies we have in the community, you would say it's diluted to franchise value. But in essence, it's not, and we're continuing to grow with those agencies. Agencies run in different circles. Policyholders, when we show up, our local field rep just creates excitement. When there's an ease of doing business, there's a value to our contract. And yes, so we will not dilute franchise value by the number of agencies we appoint. We would dilute it as if we started working with agencies that don't meet our, I'd say, professional standards.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Lederer, excuse me, the follow-up from Charles Lederer from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nCharles Lederer: I was just going to ask on the Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global commentary. I think you mentioned more competitiveness in Cincinnati Global. I'm just wondering what you're referencing, and I guess if you could give some color on the growth in Cincinnati Re and I guess how that book has maybe changed this year versus last year.\nSteve Spray: Yes, Charlie, Steve Spray again. Every line of business in CGU is growing except for direct in fact, or what many would refer to as shared lay. And I think you're hearing that out in the marketplace as well, is there's just more capital that's come into that large property space, and it's putting pressure on CGU. They're remaining, they're executing on the same underwriting and pricing discipline that we are here at Cincinnati Insurance. And they're just noticing the difficulty in finding the opportunities to grow that direct in fact business. But every other line of business through the first six months of the year in CGU is up. Now, Cincinnati Re, we think we're in an enviable position there as well in that it's an allocated capital model. We did not set up a separate company. They do not have their own balance sheet. They're writing on Cincinnati Insurance paper. What we ask of Cincinnati Re is just to try to peg the capital that's needed for each risk that they write, and then that they get a hurdle rate on that that is an attractive return on a risk-adjusted basis for us, or they do not have to deploy the capital. There is no pressure in Cincinnati Re to grow. But they are growing, I think nicely, and we're looking at that more with a long hold, they'll be more opportunistic in that arena and say maybe we can so much in Cincinnati Insurance. And you look at the combined ratio there. It's been spectacular. They're profitable inception to date since we spun up. Cincinnati Re, they've changed their mix a bit over time, particularly in property cap, property retro. So they're able to react pretty quickly on these things. And, I think our runway for growth with Cincinnati Re is very solid too.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steve Spray for any closing remarks.\nSteve Spray: Thank you, Jason. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you again on the third quarter call.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Spray",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. We had a good quarter and first half of the year. In addition to our strong financial performance, recent travel to meet with agents reinforced my excitement about the future. Agents are quite enthusiastic about doing business with us, citing our responsiveness as we answer the call, both literally and figuratively, to help them navigate this challenging insurance market. While picking up the phone is part of our culture, the confidence we have in our expertise and Cincinnati's financial strength lets us continue growing profitably, delivering insurance solutions for our agents and their best clients. Net income of $312 million for the second quarter of 2024 included recognition of $112 million on an after-tax basis for the increase in fair value of equity securities still held. Non-GAAP operating income of $204 million for the second quarter was up $13 million from a year ago. Investment income continued to grow nicely and contributed $17 million of the increase. The 98.5% second quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 0.9 percentage points higher than the second quarter of last year and included a decrease of 0.8 points for catastrophe losses. That brought the first half combined ratio to 96.1%. A nice place to be as we head into the second half of the year. Typically, the end of the year tends to be better than the beginning, in part due to the catastrophe loss ratio averaging about two points better in the second half based on the past 10 years. Our 88.2% accident year 2024 combined ratio before catastrophe losses improved by 2.2 percentage points compared with accident year 2023 for the second quarter. It was 0.7 points better on a six-month basis. Once again, overall reserve development of prior accident years was favorable. Although it was 3.6 points lower than a year ago, as we continue to consider uncertainty regarding ultimate losses and remain prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We are entering the second half of the year with confidence and optimism. In addition to improved accident year results and an overall combined ratio for the first half of 2024 that was better than last year's first half, we are pleased with other measures regarding our operating performance. We had strong second quarter premium growth and believe it is profitable growth. We continue to use pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases along with careful risk selection to help improve our underwriting profitability. Those efforts, plus others, are bolstering our progress in managing elevated inflation effects on insured losses. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance produced another quarter of profitable business for us and we continue to appoint additional agencies where we see appropriate expansion opportunities. Our underwriters continue to do excellent work as they emphasize retaining profitable accounts and managing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing based on our risk selection and pricing expertise. Estimated average renewal price increases for the second quarter were again at healthy levels with commercial lines near the low end of the high single-digit percentage range, excess and surplus lines in the high single-digit range, personal auto in the low double-digit range, and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 14% for the quarter, including 12% growth in agency renewal premiums and 34% in new business premiums. Next, I'll briefly highlight operating performance by insured segment, focusing on second quarter premium growth and underwriting profitability compared with a year ago. Commercial lines grew net written premiums 7% for the second quarter with a 99.1% combined ratio that increased by 2.2 percentage points and included prior accident year reserve development that was less favorable by 2.9 points. Personal lines grew net written premiums 30%, including growth in middle market accounts in addition to Cincinnati private client business for our agency's high net worth clients. Its combined ratio was 106.9%, 0.7% percentage points better than last year, despite an increase of 1.2 points from higher catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines grew net written premiums 15% and was also profitable with a combined ratio of 95.4%, up 3.2 percentage points from second quarter a year ago due to unfavorable reserve development. Both Cincinnati REIT and Cincinnati Global were again very profitable and continue to reflect our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati REIT's combined ratio for the second quarter of 2024 was an excellent 70.1%. It grew net written premiums by 17%, bringing the overall six-month written premium for 2024 in line with 2023. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 63.2%. While it grew net written premiums 2% for the first half of the year, second quarter premiums were down 18%, reflecting pricing discipline in a very competitive market. Our life insurance subsidiary had an outstanding quarter, including net income of $24 million and operating income growth of 26%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance, the value creation ratio. Our second quarter, 2024 VCR, was 2.2%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 1.6%. Our overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 0.6%. Now Chief Financial Officer Mike Sewell will add his comments to highlight other parts of our financial performance. Thanks, Mike. Before we move on to questions, I'd like to share some additional observations based on my first few months as CEO. I've spoken with many of our agents and associates, and they share my high level of confidence in the future of this company. In the first six months of this year, we've achieved a combined ratio of 96.1%. That makes 12.5 consecutive years of underwriting profit. A core loss ratio that continues to improve. Growth in net written premiums of 14%, with investment income up 13%. We've set the stage for 64 years of increasing dividends to shareholders. In the most challenging market of my career, our balance sheet allows us to lean in and grow with our agents. And I'm really excited about where we're headed. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Johnston, Steve Soloria, Mark Schambow, and Teresa Hopper. Jason, please open the call for questions. That was for -- thank you for the question. That was for commercial casualty only. That is exactly correct. That's correct. Okay. Well, this is Steve, Mike. First of all, I would just say, from my perspective, overall, there always seems to be movement in prior accident year losses. Some develop better than expected, sometimes higher than expected, as you know. It can be different by segment, line of business, and certainly accident years. It's, as you know, reserving is not a perfect science. That being said, couldn't be more confident in our process and the experience team that we have that are setting those reserves and taking the approach that we do. Comfortable with management's best estimate of ultimate losses here at the end of the second quarter. We've always had a track record, a long history of overall favorable development on a line basis. And in these most recent accident years, in any most recent accident year, I feel like we've always been very prudent in realizing there's not as much data there and just recognizing the uncertainty. And I think that uncertainty is still there. It's always going to be there in those most recent accident years. But I think our actuaries, they look at that and they take it into account. And I think one of the other benefits is that we're all here in one building. I think that's something that sometimes gets underestimated is that we're all here and we are talking literally multiple times a day with pricing actuaries, with the reserving actuaries, and then with the business years. And I think we're quick to act to things that we see on reserving, and we're just as quick to act when we see things in underwriting. Commercial umbrella, I'm really peeling it back here now, Mike, but, commercial umbrella, we noticed in the second quarter of '22, if you recall, just some unfavorable results there. Our actuaries were quick to act and take the appropriate action on the reserves, and then our underwriting was just as quick to act as well. And we reduced limits. We took terms and conditions action based on the fleet size, let's say, on the auto, certain classes of business, certain jurisdictions, and I think we jumped all over that. And now through six months of this year, commercial umbrella is running in the mid-90s, and things are looking very favorable there as well. Yes, Mike. The high single digit on commercial casualty is correct, and that was consistent from the first quarter. I would say the commercial market -- we're a package writer, and the commercial marketplace, I would say, is rational and orderly. But my view is we still see runway for increased rate in the commercial marketplace. Now, the other thing I always have a caveat there is what we're really executing on and focusing here at the company at Cincinnati is segmentation and pricing these risks, risk by risk. And just the tools that we have, the predictive analytics we use to price the product is -- the average just doesn't tell the full story, as you can understand. And just the underwriting teams are just executing excellent on our segmentation strategy. Yes, thank you, Mike. Much appreciated. Yes. I think, again, Greg, I think I've got this right on your question, but, insurance from our perspective is a local business, and it varies by state. It varies by size of account. Like I said, we're a package underwriter. We compete with national carriers. We compete with the small regional mutuals. And where our real focus is, is just focusing on what we do and building those deep relationships with those local agents. And when we're showing up, and like I said in my opening remarks, when we answer the call, we're confident in our risk selection, confident in our ability to price that product, and we're confident in the relationships we have with our agents because we've built those deep relationships that I don't worry about growth. We're continuing to appoint new agencies across the country. Like I said, when we see opportunity, we'll continue to do that going forward. But, it's all about the discipline and the risk selection and the pricing, and then we let it come to us. If you look at new business and commercial lines through the first half, up over 30%. The first half of last year, we were down considerably. Our risk selection and our pricing has not changed. What's changed is the environment that we're operating in, and those risks came to us. We didn't change our pricing discipline one bit, and the beauty is, is we can see that risk by risk, line by line. Thank you very much, Greg. I really appreciate it. Yes. It moves around a little bit, Charlie, but right now, both are growing, as you can see, both are growing in a very healthy manner. Right now, middle market is outpacing high net worth a little bit or private client a little bit. That bounces around from quarter-to-quarter. We're also growing our E&S personal lines opportunity. I think the real key, from my perspective and from all of our perspectives, is that we have become, for our agents, a premier rider of personal lines, both in middle market and in private client or high net worth. And that just gives our agents a tremendous amount of confidence. We can be a solution for a bigger percentage of their business. We've got the sophisticated pricing that we need in the middle market for the comparative radar world. And then we've got the expertise in the private client. Now you add an E&S option where we can provide capacity for our agents and the insureds in their communities. And I've never seen a personal lines market like this. I think it's generational. And I think we are really taking advantage of the opportunity to, again, help our agents and help the policy holders in their community. We are open for business. We're confident in our pricing on a prospective basis, which is the way we always look at it. We've got a great leadership team. We've got tremendous expertise throughout the organization. So I really believe that the personal lines right now is transformational for Cincinnati Insurance. Mike, thanks for the question. I've always found you to be extremely positive. Obviously, personal auto, short tail line, the adverse development that you're seeing there is all in bodily injury. Our physical damage in personal auto is performing very well. I will say again, short tail line, the vast majority of that adverse development is in accident year 2023, and there's a little bit in the 2022. And if you think about this as well, we are a market for middle market and high net worth, like I was saying. But as our high net worth book continues to grow and be a bigger portion of our overall personal lines business, we're getting all kinds of diversification, positive effects from that. And one of those is in personal auto. When you have high net worth, it's driven by property and less so by auto. Middle market, more driven by auto and less in the property piece. So that mix is shifting as well. And I think you're seeing that in a favorable way in our overall results. We continue to get, we've had rate early into that book, that personal auto book for quite some time now, and that continues into 2024. And I don't see an end in sight of rate coming into that book either. No, Mike, I can't say that we've seen that. We've been pretty stable on that front. Yes. No. Mike, as far as the rate environment, we've been stacking quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter of additional rate throughout every major line in commercial lines, except for workers' compensation. But I would say that the commercial market, and again, it all depends on size of the account. It depends on the state that you're in. But just generally speaking, I would characterize the commercial marketplace as responsible and orderly. There are moving parts. You see it in other carriers' reports. There's uncertainty out there. And I think that uncertainty has certainly promoted the continued rate that you're seeing across all lines in commercial lines. And I don't see a softening market in commercial lines. You'll hear little pockets of different things, different lines of business, maybe a different class here and there. But just generally speaking, all lines, all classes, countrywide, I think from Cincinnati's perspective, it's orderly and rational. Thank you, Grace, and good morning. Yes, commercial auto is, we feel, again, feel really good about where we are there. You look back into 2016 and 2017, and we were having some real challenges in commercial auto. It's kind of the same story I was talking about with umbrella earlier. We recognized it, our actuaries acted upon it quickly, and we reacted very quickly. Personally, I think maybe a little ahead of the market on commercial auto. We got it in a good spot, but then we hit the pandemic, and inflation did what it did. And so we had to get some more rate in that book to keep up with inflation. But that commercial auto book was in good shape, quite frankly, from the actions we took in 2016 and 2017. And I think it also -- to really answer your question too, kind of peel that back, is if you look at the mix that we write at Cincinnati, one of the analysts just a minute ago mentioned, there's a construction book. We've got a manufacturing, retail, wholesale. We're not big into trucking or transportation risks. I think you see a lot more volatility there. We've just managed that book, I think, really well and feel really good about where we are with it today. So I think it's risk selection. I think it's just the makeup of our book. We're a package writer. We don't write motor auto. We don't write trucking or transportation. And I think that's what you're seeing. Grace, I'm sorry. You were coming in and out there. I apologize. Could you restate that? I think, Grace, what I think, if I'm answering you correctly here, is we're looking at all the data. We're looking at paid. We're looking at case. We're looking at things that are happening inside the book for management views of the actuaries. And there's going to be noise quarter-to-quarter. I think looking at it over a longer period, 12 months or maybe even a little longer, will probably be more obstructive. And I hope I answered that for you. Yes. Thanks, Meyer. I would say from my perspective, I just don't, and this might sound kind of crazy, I just don't pay a lot of attention to what others are doing around us. I'm more focused on what we're doing risk-by-risk, town-by-town, agent-by-agent, and how we compete. And sometimes we run into situations where we lose this account, or we write this account. So I think it would be too broad to generalize. I would say to you this, on personal lines, we're seeing more tumultuous time from all those markets, particularly here in the Midwest. And we're seeing more and more opportunities in the middle market personal line space just on an exponential basis. Just the number of quotes and the opportunities that we're seeing is just up considerably and there's something to that. And I think a big piece of that is that we've got the balance sheet. Like I mentioned in my comments earlier, we're showing up to the agencies with 12.7 billion of GAAP equity looking to grow. Our doors are open. We're confident in the way we price that business. The terms and conditions that we're putting on homeowner business are as strong today as I've ever seen them in my career. And I think that they'll stay, particularly, wind and hail deductibles, roof schedules to combat the continued severe convective storms. And I think those things, along with re-insurance, are putting pressure on some of those markets that you mentioned and it's creating opportunity for Cincinnati. Thank you. I would say no. I would say the key and the key message that I'm sending and that we're executing on, and we're doing an excellent job of this, is with Cincinnati, it's more about the quality of the agent and the professionalism of the local agent that we're doing business with than it is about the numbers. Now, we want to do business with as few agents as possible, but as many as necessary. We've got roughly 2,100 agency relationships across the country. By any measure, that is extremely exclusive as far as distribution goes. I'm not saying this is a goal at all, but if we doubled our distribution on a relative basis, we would still have an exclusive contract compared to any of our peers that I can see in the industry. And again, I'm not saying we're doubling our agency plan, but I am telling you that we have plenty of opportunity to continue to appoint professional agents across the country, and you'll see us continue to do that. I can show you areas here in Ohio. If you looked at the number of agencies we have in the community, you would say it's diluted to franchise value. But in essence, it's not, and we're continuing to grow with those agencies. Agencies run in different circles. Policyholders, when we show up, our local field rep just creates excitement. When there's an ease of doing business, there's a value to our contract. And yes, so we will not dilute franchise value by the number of agencies we appoint. We would dilute it as if we started working with agencies that don't meet our, I'd say, professional standards. Yes, Charlie, Steve Spray again. Every line of business in CGU is growing except for direct in fact, or what many would refer to as shared lay. And I think you're hearing that out in the marketplace as well, is there's just more capital that's come into that large property space, and it's putting pressure on CGU. They're remaining, they're executing on the same underwriting and pricing discipline that we are here at Cincinnati Insurance. And they're just noticing the difficulty in finding the opportunities to grow that direct in fact business. But every other line of business through the first six months of the year in CGU is up. Now, Cincinnati Re, we think we're in an enviable position there as well in that it's an allocated capital model. We did not set up a separate company. They do not have their own balance sheet. They're writing on Cincinnati Insurance paper. What we ask of Cincinnati Re is just to try to peg the capital that's needed for each risk that they write, and then that they get a hurdle rate on that that is an attractive return on a risk-adjusted basis for us, or they do not have to deploy the capital. There is no pressure in Cincinnati Re to grow. But they are growing, I think nicely, and we're looking at that more with a long hold, they'll be more opportunistic in that arena and say maybe we can so much in Cincinnati Insurance. And you look at the combined ratio there. It's been spectacular. They're profitable inception to date since we spun up. Cincinnati Re, they've changed their mix a bit over time, particularly in property cap, property retro. So they're able to react pretty quickly on these things. And, I think our runway for growth with Cincinnati Re is very solid too. Thank you, Jason. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you again on the third quarter call."

Investment income continued to grow up 10% for the second quarter of 2024 compared with the same quarter in 2023. Dividend income was down 1% or $1 million for the quarter, primarily due to two unusual items that totaled approximately $2 million. One was a holding with a June x dividend date in 2023 that moved to July 1st in 2024. The other was a holding that reduced its dividend rate by 53% after a spinoff transaction. Bond interest income grew 18% for the second quarter of this year. We again added fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $771 million for the first six months of the year. The second quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.64% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 30 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the second quarter of 2024 was 6.06%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the second quarter of 2024 were favorable for our equity portfolio and unfavorable for our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $149 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net loss of $93 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.7 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.4 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $700 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income in addition to higher bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for the first six months of 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 33% from a year ago. I'll move on to expense management, where we always work to balance controlling expenses with making strategic investments in our business. The second quarter of 2024 property casualty underlying expense ratio was 0.5% points higher than last year, reflecting higher levels of profit sharing commissions for agencies in employee-related expenses. Next, let me comment on lost reserves, where our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actually estimated range of net loss and lost expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information, such as paid losses and case reserves. Then, we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first six months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss expense reserves was $578 million, including $506 million for the IB&R portion. During the second quarter, we experienced $40 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 1.9 percentage points. The commercial line segment saw overall favorable reserve development of $29 million, driven by workers' compensation and commercial property, which more than offset the unfavorable development in commercial casualty. Commercial casualty was again the line of business having the largest amount of unfavorable reserve development, with a total of $28 million for the quarter, or less than 1% of that line's year-end 2023 reserve balance. We released reserves in some recent accident years and added reserves totaling $51 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2021, including $30 million for 2018 through 2020, due to case incurred losses emerging at amounts higher than we expected. The unfavorable amounts reflects our slowing the release of IB&R reserves for some of those older accident years while adding to others. On an all-lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first six months of 2024 included favorable $269 million for 2023, favorable $36 million for 2022, favorable $17 million for 2021, and an unfavorable $182 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2021, with commercial casualty representing $167 million of the unfavorable $182 million. I'll conclude my comments with the capital management highlights, another area where we have a consistent long-term approach. We paid $125 million in dividends to shareholders during the second quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 395,000 shares, an average price per share of $116.33. We think our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter end was nearly $5 billion. Debt to total capital contributed continued to be under 10%. And our quarter end book value was at a record high, $81.79 per share, with $12.8 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. Greg, this is Mike. Thanks for the question. On a year-to-date basis, as I mentioned, it did go up a little bit. Our combined ratio for the year was down a little bit, so the profit-sharing commission for the agencies, does go up, as we do invest for the future with hiring folks and so forth and other items, employee-related expenses is up a little bit. But when I look down the line, I do see where total dollars are going up, but, the rate of our earned premiums are outpacing the expenses as they increase, which is what I'm trying to do, what we're trying to do. So I think we're making good progress. I look at some of the expense categories, and actually they're down a little bit on a percentage, even though total dollars are up. So, seeing it right now at the 30.1 on a year-to-date basis, as we've been saying over the years, we've been trying to get below a 30, and so we're going to keep doing that. But, right now it's a little bit elevated probably from where I'd like it to be for all the right reasons of really paying the commissions to the agencies. Can you repeat that question again, please? Yes. I think we feel really good about the reserves. And first of all, the overall reserves with where we're at, but it was the 2020 to 2018 years that I mentioned the $30 million that was unfavorable versus the more recent accident years. If I think about the commercial casualty reserves and some of the things that actually makes me feel pretty good about it, when you look at the first six months of this year, we have been increasing our IBNR ratio, which I think we've kind of indicated. And so, for commercial casualty, we're about 10 percentage points higher of what we're adding for IBNR currently than when we were at the pre-pandemic full years of 2017 through 2019. So, just having the extra 10 percentage points, I think that's paying off for us. If I do look at through the end of the second quarter, our incurred loss, loss adjustment expense ratio, on average, if I take the '22, '23 year for commercial casualty, those picks are a little bit higher than those pre-pandemic years of 2017 through 2019. So, I think our ultimate picks are higher. And then, I think Steve mentioned it, with the confidence I think that we all have, with our process and so forth. If I look back over the last 15 years, I probably could have kept going. I think my spreadsheet was running out, but there was only two commercial casualty accident years that have not developed favorably during that time period from the original estimated ultimate picks at 12 months. So, I'm very confident as Steve is, with our process, the people doing it, et cetera, et cetera. So, I hope that's the color that you're looking for. That is actually, that is for the commercial casualty when I'm looking at that by accident year or calendar year. Yes. Thanks, Mike. We have a strong appetite for workers' comp. 10 or 12 years ago, we really got serious about all levels of comp, claims, loss control, risk selection, especially pricing. We are looking to grow comp when we think that we can get the right rate on a risk-adjusted basis, and you're right. I thought that this deterioration in rate would show up more so in the results, quite frankly, several years ago, and it hasn't. But I think it's such a long tail line, and it historically has such volatility to it. We just think being prudent in our risk selection and our pricing there and not to chase that is a prudent thing to do for the long-term. And when we can write work comp at the right rate today on business that we like, we're writing it, and we're looking for it, and we're talking to our agents about it. It's just we just don't see the rate environment right now as attractive. Again, I understand it's performing well on a calendar year basis, but we just think over the long pull, being extra vigilant on workers' compensation is prudent."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dennis McDaniel, Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\nDennis McDaniel: Hello, this is Dennis McDaniel at Cincinnati Financial. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Late yesterday, we issued a news release on our results along with our supplemental financial package, including our quarter-end investment portfolio. To find copies of any of these documents, please visit our investor website cinfin.com/investors. The shortest route to the information is the Quarterly Results link in the Navigation menu on the far left. On this call, you'll first hear from Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Johnston; and then from Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell. After their prepared remarks, investors participating on the call may ask questions. At that time, some responses may be made by others in the room with us, including President Steve Spray; Chief Investment Officer, Steve Soloria; and Cincinnati Insurance's Chief Claims Officer, Marc Schambow; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance, Theresa Hoffer. First, please note that some of the matters to be discussed today are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. With respect to these risks and uncertainties, we direct your attention to our news release and to our various filings with the SEC. Also, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures was provided with the news release. Statutory accounting data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP. Now, I'll turn-over the call to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. In short, we are off to a great start. Our first-quarter results reflect the success of our initiatives to continue balancing the profit and growth of our insurance operations coupled with strong investment income. Net income of $755 million for the first quarter of 2024 included recognition of $484 million on an after-tax basis were the increase in fair value of equity securities still held, representing about three quarters of the increase in net income. Strong operating results generated the rest of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income of $272 million for the first quarter nearly doubled last year's $141 million, including a decrease in catastrophe losses of $93 million on an after-tax basis. The 93.6% first quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 7.1 points better than the first quarter of last year, including a decrease of 6.9 points for catastrophe losses. While our combined ratio for accident year 2024 before catastrophe losses was a percentage point higher than accident year 2023 at three months, if we exclude Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, the ratio improved by 1 point. Accident year 2024 also improved on a case incurred basis. However, we increased incurred but not reported or IBNR reserves as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses and remain prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We are also pleased with other measures indicating good momentum in our operating performance. Another quarter of pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases helped to improve our underwriting profitability, combining with careful risk selection and other efforts to address elevated inflation effects on incurred losses. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance, supported by our experienced and professional associates produced another quarter of profitable business for us. Our underwriters continue to emphasize retaining profitable accounts and managing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing based on our risk selection and pricing expertise. Estimated average renewal price increases for the first quarter continued at a healthy pace with commercial lines near the low-end of the high single-digit percentage range, excess and surplus lines in the high single-digit range. Personal auto in the low double-digit range and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 11% for the quarter with what we believe was a nice mix of new business and renewals. I'll briefly review operating performance by insurance segment, highlighting premium growth and improved profitability compared to a year-ago. Commercial lines grew net written premiums 7% in the first quarter with a 96.5% combined ratio that improved by 3.9 percentage points, including 4.2 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 33%, including growth in middle-market accounts in addition to private client business for our agency's high-net worth clients. Its combined ratio was a very profitable 93.9%, 18.6 percentage points better than last year, including 15.9 points from lower catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines also produced a profitable combined ratio of 91.9%, rising 2 percentage points from the first quarter a year-ago, along with net written premium growth of 7%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continue to produce significant underwriting profit, reflecting our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was an excellent 78.6%. That includes IBNR that we routinely carry for expected losses from reinsurance treaties. We believe our potential exposure for losses from the Baltimore bridge collapse is immaterial. Cincinnati Re's net written premiums decreased by 12% overall, driven by a shifting casualty portfolio mix in response to changing market conditions. Property and specialty premiums increased due to attractive opportunities in pricing. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 69.8%, they again reported strong growth with net written premiums up 28%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its strong performance, including first quarter 2024 net income of $19 million and operating income growth of 17%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance to value-creation ratio. Our first quarter 2024 DCR was a strong 5.9%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 2.3%, higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 3.6%. Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments to highlight other parts of our financial performance.\nMike Sewell: Thank you, Steve, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. Investment income growth continued at a strong pace, up 17% for the first quarter 2024 compared with the first quarter of 2023. Dividend income was up 9% for the quarter despite net equity security sales for the first three months of 2024 that totaled $40 million. Bond interest income grew 21% for the first quarter of this year. We continue to add more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $374 million for the first three months of the year. The first quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.65% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 40 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2024 was 5.79%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the first quarter 2024 were favorable for our equity portfolio and unfavorable for our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $602 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net loss of $65 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.6 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.2 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $625 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income in addition to higher bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2024 was $353 million, up 41% from a year ago. Our expense management objectives include an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2024 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.7 percentage points higher than last year, primarily related to higher levels of profit-sharing commissions for agencies. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarily estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first three months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss expense reserves was $233 million, including $272 million for the IBNR portion. During the first quarter, we experienced $100 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.0 percentage points. Almost every line of business had favorable development except for commercial casualty, which was unfavorable by just $254,000. We added reserves to several older prior accident years and reduced reserves for the three most recent accident years. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first three months of 2024 included favorable $184 million for 2023, favorable $24 million for 2022 and an unfavorable $108 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2022. The unfavorable amount reflects our slowing the release of IBNR reserves for those older accident years. I'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights, another area where we have a consistent long-term approach. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 680,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.89. We think our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt-to-total capital continued to be under 10% and our quarter-end book value was a record high, $80.83 per share with $12.7 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Mike. As we previously announced, this is my last conference call as CEO. Effective at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders next Saturday, President, Steve Spray will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. As I've mentioned before, Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his abilities to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for shareholders, agents and associates. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Raghav, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charlie Lederer with Citi. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Lederer: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You gave some helpful color on your loss picks, but I'm curious, how should we think about your loss picks in commercial casualty? Have you made any changes to your view of loss trend just given the trajectory of the current accident year loss ratio and are you baking in additional caution? Should we expect you to hold a bit more of a buffer near-term given uncertainty?\nSteve Johnston: Yes. We feel confident, Charlie, with the loss pick that we had, we are reflecting uncertainty. There's a lot of good going on in the commercial casualty with rates we feel exceeding our loss cost trends. However, for first quarter where there's additional uncertainty, we are recognizing that in our loss ticket.\nCharlie Lederer: Got it. Thank you. Maybe in workers' comp, it looks like pricing took an incremental step down in your initial loss ticket higher too. Is there anything in that pick, I guess, beyond pricing being down more or I guess, are you seeing anything there?\nMike Sewell: So, we're just continuing to see the same trends that we have been seeing with rates under pressure there, but also strong performance historically from the line. We are though recognizing the uncertainty that it comes with the rate decreases with a little bit higher loss pick for the current year.\nCharlie Lederer: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nMike Sewell: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hi, thanks. In the earnings release, you talked about the underlying loss ratio for commercial improving 1 point, but you said excluding Cincinnati Re and Global. But was there a reason you pointed that out is what -- why did -- I'm not sure I may have missed it, why did the Cincinnati Re, Global underlying loss ratio increase so much?\nSteve Johnston: Yes I think the point of pointing is out is we have the three segments commercialized, personalized, in excess of surplus lines. To get to the consolidated, you also have to add the other portion, which includes Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. So, since the first three segments I mentioned had improvements, we pointed out those in the other segment. I will emphasize that things are going great for both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. I think one of the things that -- as we mentioned, we don't think we have material exposure to the bridge collapse in Baltimore. We have been shaping the Cincinnati Re book in a very positive manner in terms of derisking. And so I think one of the things that caused the attritional to go up if we compare it to the same quarter a year ago is that the mix has shifted to a little bit more of a pro rata or proportional reinsurance, which would have less risk margin in it. It would have a higher attritional pick, but there would be less volatility there. And so I think that would be driving what we're seeing there in Cincinnati Re, a very strong zero CATs for the quarter, 10.4 points of favorable development versus 7.7 of adverse a year ago. I think the $14 million in favorable development that we show, about $13 million of it came from 2023. With the full year combined ratio of 2023 at 77.7% in this first quarter at a strong 78.6%, this hard work in reshaping the book has really paid off. The inception-to-date combined ratio at the end of the year 2022 was 101.2 and with those two strong marks in the full year of 2023 and the first quarter here and now in just over a year, our inception-to-date is at 94.5. So I think the action is paying off and it does show a higher pick in the current action year, but I think it's a less risky portfolio at this point. I think the same thing for Cincinnati Global, but I don't know if you want to talk a little bit more about Cincinnati Global?\nMike Sewell: For Cincinnati Global, same thing, strong 69.8%. They have had three consecutive years now as a top quartile Lloyd's underwriter and while they've done that, they've been diversifying in terms of their footprint by product line, by geography, and they're also providing an additional avenue for access to Lloyd's for the agents that are appointed by CIC. So a lot of positive at CGU reflected with strong results. And again, it's pretty tough at Lloyd's to be top quartile three years in a row the way they've done. Also this quarter, zero CATs versus 11.1 a year ago. And then the reserve development is favorable by 25.6 points this year versus adverse by 3.2 a year ago. So I think in both of those businesses, there's a ton of positive going on. And we've only pointed it out so that the math would be easier as you saw the consolidated CLD, the commercialized department, the personal lines and the excess and surplus and then to add the other portion to get to the consolidated.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful color. And I guess would you say then because of some of the business mix-shift and since they read and we should be thinking about the underlying loss ratio structurally being maybe a little bit higher, but then -- but less potential volatility around the overall combined ratio at? Did I interject, did you guys want to say something else or I'll move on to my follow-up?\nSteve Johnston: No, please move on to the follow-up.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Thanks. So just thinking about going commercial lines ex Reinsurance and Global. You've been on along this path of taking action to add, I guess, some reserves or just conservatism into your picks given the inflationary environment which you're -- clearly is persisting a bit. If I look at like overall top line growth and maybe I'll -- you can talk about the whole segment, but I'll just focus on commercial casualty because that's been one of the areas where inflation has been higher than expected. If I look at just overall top line growth, net premium written growth, now it's still not at I think your historical levels relative to the industry, but it has been ticking up a bit. And are you -- so given you're still in an environment where you seem to be kind of adding more IBNR, are you getting to a point, is pricing at a level or is the environment there where you want to start playing more offense? Or are we still kind of in the -- it's best to be cautious in terms of your top line growth.\nMike Sewell: So yes, I think that we can balance the two. I think we feel good about our growth, double digit overall at 11%, really strong growth in Personal lines. And with each of our lines, we write it on a package basis for Commercial lines, and so there's going to be a little bit of variance between the different lines. But we think we are in a good place with our pricing, but we realize that you need to stick to adequate pricing. And you can't fall into a trap where if others are underpricing business that you follow that path. So we're going to maintain the discipline, charge the adequate rate on a on a risk by risk basis and we think that offers us plenty of opportunity to grow the company.\nMike Zaremski: And one quick follow-up, and I might have asked this in the past, but within your commercial casualty, the US non-global and reinsurance portfolio, I believe you might think about things between small -- very small commercial versus mid versus large or maybe I'm incorrect, but just curious if you're -- now that you've had more time to reflect on results, it is -- doesn't the inflationary issues you have brought up, have they been emanating from any certain parts of the business mix other than just\u2026\nSteve Johnston: Yes, I think we're doing a good job of pricing adequately in all those areas. I do think and I pointed out on the calls before, you really do have to pay a close attention to the higher levels because there's a leveraged effect of inflation with every layer that you go up for a constant ground-up inflation rate, there'll be more or higher inflation with each layer as you go up because of the layer below inflating into the higher layer. But we've been on this for some time. We've got some really talented actuaries that are working with our larger risks and we feel we were addressing it early-on from the beginning and that we're in a good position across the board.\nMike Zaremski: Thanks for the color.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks very much. And our next question comes from Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks, good morning. In terms of personal auto, your comments, Steve, in the beginning, were pretty similar in terms of pricing from last quarter. You had a bit of an uptick back in the loss ratio there. I guess, can you remind us where you expect this year to kind of pan out in terms of just the profitability of personal auto and when you think your pricing will maybe peak and start to come back down? It looks like -- and you don't give it, but you're probably still above 100% combined ratio there. So when do you expect kind of profitability in personal auto?\nSteve Johnston: I think we're in a good position. Personal lines across the board, it is sold a lot on a package -- in a package position. The first quarter was -- for current accident year was actually down a little bit from first quarter a year ago and pretty flat with the full year. So we feel we feel good about the pricing that we've been able to get-in auto, home and in the other lines. And we think it will reap benefits. And I think Steve's got a little to add-on.\nSteve Spray: Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. I think one of the strengths that we have going and it's been a plan we've been executing on, continue to work on for the last several years. So it's nothing new. But I think it's adding value to the company and to our agents is that we've become a premium or premier writer for our agents both in the middle-market space and in the high-net worth. And that gives us both product diversification as well as geographic diversification. High-net worth, while we write it everywhere, tends to be maybe a little more focused in certain geographies. High-net worth or private client is heavier on the property side. And then on the middle-market, we give geographic diversification as that book is primarily, I'll call it, a Midwestern, Southeastern part of the US book of business and it's heavier in auto. So we're getting one, being that much more important to each of our agents, being able to attract more of their business, but at the same time, get the diversification both geographically and by line of business.\nSteve Johnston: Yes, I think too, just the history of personal lines in general with the $795 million combined this year. Last year, we were over just a touch over $100 million and then it was what, the four prior years to 2023, we were under $100 million. So we've really -- I think we've demonstrated a history of being able to price personal lines pretty darn well across the spectrum as Steve mentions.\nSteve Spray: And then now I might add, we've got our -- we've got the E&S capability that we can provide solutions for our agents and their clients. And that's now active in nine states. So we just feel really good about all personal lines, the growth there, the momentum that we have. So, feel very bullish on personal lines.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you. Next one is just back on the commercial lines and this is kind of a number-specific question. So, if it requires a follow-up, I'm happy to do so. But if I look at your claim -- reported claim counts that you give in your statutory data, for other liability, it's down significantly for 2023 accident year. I mean more so than the 2020 accident year COVID-related. So I don't know if there's a data thing there or not, but reported claim counts at 12 months or 15% down in other liability. I don't know if that's something that you've seen or expect or can you comment on that? Again, paid losses aren't, but the reported claim counts for GL, i.e., the liability are down significantly at age 12.\nSteve Johnston: Yes, they are. And I think that's very helpful in terms of the way we're underwriting the book. It is a severity issue that we're seeing there.\nMichael Phillips: So you recognize the frequency is down significantly then for other liabilities, Steve?\nSteve Johnston: Yes, we do.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Greg Peters at Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. So the first question I'll focus on is just growth in the commercial lines business because it seems like you're -- when you look at the stats from a new business production, you're having a lot of success there. And I was wondering if you could give us some sense on how your quote to bind ratio is working or give us some parameters to think about it because I guess given the results, we'd expect some increased competition at some point that doesn't seem to necessarily be reflecting in your numbers.\nSteve Spray: Thanks for the question, Greg. Steve Spray. If you recall last year throughout 2023, especially starting the year, our new commercial lines business was under pressure really for that first six months and we were down quite a bit on the same over 2022. We were really executing on underwriting term condition, pricing discipline through that first six months. We stuck to our guns. I think some others maybe just had a little different view of the risk and our new business was under pressure. On the back half of 2023, we continue to see our new business improve. We stuck to our guns as well. We stayed disciplined in the pricing, the underwriting terms and conditions. Back half of 2023, new business really picked up. That is obviously -- that trend has obviously continued into 2024. The beauty of it is that like Steve said, we're a package underwriter, we look at every single risk on its own merits and we have the tools to price the business with predictive analytics for each major line of business, look at it by line of business and then for the total account. So I see runway still for new business and commercial lines in 2024, but like Steve said, the key is that we stay disciplined with our underwriting and our pricing and earn the business, not buy it.\nGreg Peters: Yes, that makes sense. So another topic that's come up that you guys have talked about is the concept of a multi-year policy that I know you guys use in certain lines of business. Can you give us an update on where you are with the three-year policies, which lines of business and has it increased as a percentage of your total book, et cetera?\nSteve Spray: I mean, you may have to follow-up on that, which percentage has increased, Greg. But yes, this is the three-year policy in general, it's a differentiator for us. It's something that we have been very committed to for many years and remain committed today. I think it's even better that we write three-year policies today because we have the sophisticated segment and pricing that we do. So our underwriters, when they quote a three-year, whether it be new or renewal, just as a reminder, even though we have a three-year package policy, about 75% of the premium that we have in commercial lines is adjusted on an annual basis. So it'd be those accounts that are coming off of a three-year are actually renewing, our commercial auto, our commercial umbrella and then workers' compensation are all adjusted annually. It's really just the property, the general liability, crime, and the marine where that rate is guaranteed. Now, I will tell you this too. Our three-year policy on a loss ratio standpoint outperforms our one-year policy. So our underwriters are executing with our agents on the -- not only the science of underwriting, but the art and intuitively, they are picking our best business, our best price business to put on a three-year package and the results show that. So we're committed to it. Our retentions are much better on a three-year policy in the middle of that three-year policy. So I think that helps agents' retentions, it helps ours. It's an expense. It certainly helps on the expense side. And then I think most importantly, it shows our agents and it shows our policyholders that we're a company that is looking for long-term relationships. And we're committed to the three-year and we think it gives us an advantage in the marketplace.\nGreg Peters: Yes, the percentage question, just I feel like this would be the time to be using more of that in this market considering the market conditions. And so I was just curious if it's, from a commercial standpoint, we can take it offline, but that's where I was thinking -- what I was thinking about when I was asking for percentages.\nSteve Spray: Yes. Okay. No, I got it. That makes total sense. Greg. Yes, wherever we feel like we can get the adequate price on account, we are wanting to use our three-year package policy.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers.\nSteve Spray: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Grace Carter at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGrace Carter: Hi, everyone. Looking at the commercial casualty core loss ratio, just given that it's a bit higher than it ran in the latter part of last year as well as the commentary on increased IBNR, I was just curious if that's primarily driven by GL or excess casualty or if it's a mix of both this quarter. And I was just curious if there is -- if you all could comment on how you're thinking about rate adequacy across both of those pieces of the book.\nSteve Johnston: I think it's kind of across the board, Grace. I do think that higher pick is something that we would do in the first quarter. Typically, we have run the first quarter a little bit higher than the full year prior just due to the newness of the accident year, but we feel very good. We feel very good about the way that we are our pricing the GL and really across the spectrum there, including the umbrella.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And I guess on the commercial auto side, it looks like growth picked up a little bit this quarter. I was just wondering if that indicates that maybe you all are starting to add some additional units rather than just top line growth being primarily driven by rate. And just kind of curious on how you all are thinking about potential growth in that environment, just given that it has been such a challenging line for the industry for so long?\nSteve Spray: Yes. Thanks for the question, Grace. Again, Steve Spray. It's a little bit of both. Candidly, it's -- we're still getting ranked through that commercial book and we are growing the new business. Again, we're a package writer. So we don't write monoline auto. That auto would come along with the rest of the package. And again, feel really good about the pricing that we have in commercial auto and our direction there. If you recall back, I think it was back to 2016, 2017 when we really undertook some real tough action on our commercial auto book, both in risk selection and then primarily in pricing, and really had commercial auto in a good place. Inflation came along and we had to -- we obviously had to work with that, but feel really good about where that commercial auto book is, both from a pricing risk selection and looking to grow that book as well along with our package business, again, risk-by-risk and adequate pricing.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nSteve Spray: Thank you, Grace.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you, Grace.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks so much. To go back to the Cincinnati Global and Reinsurance side of things, just I'm not sure I understand, when you talk about lower volatility, is that a function of less seasonality or less catastrophic exposure?\nSteve Johnston: It would be less catastrophic exposure.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. The second question sort of related. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the year-over-year, I guess, trend or the observed claim inflation rate for commercial property, is that decelerating at all compared to last year?\nSteve Johnston: I think we still see inflation. We look at so much on a risk by risk basis that I don't know that I have a good number for you across the board on what we're seeing with inflation. And it's been a sticky thing in the inflation rates on insurance related items, building materials and wages and so forth have been higher than the general CPI. So we take a cautious view, but certainly the rate of the increase in the second derivatives has been slowing down.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That's very helpful. And Steve, congratulations and thanks for everything.\nSteve Johnston: Well, thank you Meyer. it's been great.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Management for any closing remarks.\nSteve Johnston: Thank you to everyone for their excellent questions and thank you for joining us today. We hope to see some of you at our shareholder meeting next Saturday, May 4 at the Cincinnati Financial Headquarters Office here. You're welcome to listen to our webcast of the meeting also available at cinfin.com/investors. Steve and Mike, look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Steve Johnston",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to hear more about our results. In short, we are off to a great start. Our first-quarter results reflect the success of our initiatives to continue balancing the profit and growth of our insurance operations coupled with strong investment income. Net income of $755 million for the first quarter of 2024 included recognition of $484 million on an after-tax basis were the increase in fair value of equity securities still held, representing about three quarters of the increase in net income. Strong operating results generated the rest of the increase. Non-GAAP operating income of $272 million for the first quarter nearly doubled last year's $141 million, including a decrease in catastrophe losses of $93 million on an after-tax basis. The 93.6% first quarter 2024 property casualty combined ratio was 7.1 points better than the first quarter of last year, including a decrease of 6.9 points for catastrophe losses. While our combined ratio for accident year 2024 before catastrophe losses was a percentage point higher than accident year 2023 at three months, if we exclude Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global, the ratio improved by 1 point. Accident year 2024 also improved on a case incurred basis. However, we increased incurred but not reported or IBNR reserves as we continue to recognize uncertainty regarding ultimate losses and remain prudent in our reserve estimates until longer-term loss cost trends become more clear. We are also pleased with other measures indicating good momentum in our operating performance. Another quarter of pricing segmentation by risk plus average price increases helped to improve our underwriting profitability, combining with careful risk selection and other efforts to address elevated inflation effects on incurred losses. Agencies representing Cincinnati Insurance, supported by our experienced and professional associates produced another quarter of profitable business for us. Our underwriters continue to emphasize retaining profitable accounts and managing ones that we determine have inadequate pricing based on our risk selection and pricing expertise. Estimated average renewal price increases for the first quarter continued at a healthy pace with commercial lines near the low-end of the high single-digit percentage range, excess and surplus lines in the high single-digit range. Personal auto in the low double-digit range and homeowner in the high single-digit range. Our consolidated property casualty net written premiums grew 11% for the quarter with what we believe was a nice mix of new business and renewals. I'll briefly review operating performance by insurance segment, highlighting premium growth and improved profitability compared to a year-ago. Commercial lines grew net written premiums 7% in the first quarter with a 96.5% combined ratio that improved by 3.9 percentage points, including 4.2 points from lower catastrophe losses. Personal lines grew net written premiums 33%, including growth in middle-market accounts in addition to private client business for our agency's high-net worth clients. Its combined ratio was a very profitable 93.9%, 18.6 percentage points better than last year, including 15.9 points from lower catastrophe losses. Excess and surplus lines also produced a profitable combined ratio of 91.9%, rising 2 percentage points from the first quarter a year-ago, along with net written premium growth of 7%. Both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global continue to produce significant underwriting profit, reflecting our efforts to diversify risk and further improve income stability. Cincinnati Re's combined ratio for the first quarter of 2024 was an excellent 78.6%. That includes IBNR that we routinely carry for expected losses from reinsurance treaties. We believe our potential exposure for losses from the Baltimore bridge collapse is immaterial. Cincinnati Re's net written premiums decreased by 12% overall, driven by a shifting casualty portfolio mix in response to changing market conditions. Property and specialty premiums increased due to attractive opportunities in pricing. Cincinnati Global's combined ratio was also excellent at 69.8%, they again reported strong growth with net written premiums up 28%. Our life insurance subsidiary continued its strong performance, including first quarter 2024 net income of $19 million and operating income growth of 17%. Term life insurance earned premiums grew 2%. I'll conclude with our primary measure of long-term financial performance to value-creation ratio. Our first quarter 2024 DCR was a strong 5.9%. Net income before investment gains or losses for the quarter contributed 2.3%, higher overall valuation of our investment portfolio and other items contributed 3.6%. Next, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sewell, will add comments to highlight other parts of our financial performance. Thank you, Mike. As we previously announced, this is my last conference call as CEO. Effective at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders next Saturday, President, Steve Spray will add the role of Chief Executive Officer. As I've mentioned before, Steve is the right person to build on our decade of profitable growth. He understands the importance of our agency-centered strategy and the unique advantages it brings. I'm confident in his abilities to bring innovative ideas together with the hallmarks of Cincinnati Insurance to create opportunities for shareholders, agents and associates. I look forward to continuing to work with him as Chairman of the Board. As a reminder, with Mike and me today are Steve Spray, Steve Soloria, Marc Schambow, and Theresa Hoffer. Raghav, please open the call for questions. Yes. We feel confident, Charlie, with the loss pick that we had, we are reflecting uncertainty. There's a lot of good going on in the commercial casualty with rates we feel exceeding our loss cost trends. However, for first quarter where there's additional uncertainty, we are recognizing that in our loss ticket. Thank you. Yes I think the point of pointing is out is we have the three segments commercialized, personalized, in excess of surplus lines. To get to the consolidated, you also have to add the other portion, which includes Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. So, since the first three segments I mentioned had improvements, we pointed out those in the other segment. I will emphasize that things are going great for both Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global. I think one of the things that -- as we mentioned, we don't think we have material exposure to the bridge collapse in Baltimore. We have been shaping the Cincinnati Re book in a very positive manner in terms of derisking. And so I think one of the things that caused the attritional to go up if we compare it to the same quarter a year ago is that the mix has shifted to a little bit more of a pro rata or proportional reinsurance, which would have less risk margin in it. It would have a higher attritional pick, but there would be less volatility there. And so I think that would be driving what we're seeing there in Cincinnati Re, a very strong zero CATs for the quarter, 10.4 points of favorable development versus 7.7 of adverse a year ago. I think the $14 million in favorable development that we show, about $13 million of it came from 2023. With the full year combined ratio of 2023 at 77.7% in this first quarter at a strong 78.6%, this hard work in reshaping the book has really paid off. The inception-to-date combined ratio at the end of the year 2022 was 101.2 and with those two strong marks in the full year of 2023 and the first quarter here and now in just over a year, our inception-to-date is at 94.5. So I think the action is paying off and it does show a higher pick in the current action year, but I think it's a less risky portfolio at this point. I think the same thing for Cincinnati Global, but I don't know if you want to talk a little bit more about Cincinnati Global? No, please move on to the follow-up. Yes, I think we're doing a good job of pricing adequately in all those areas. I do think and I pointed out on the calls before, you really do have to pay a close attention to the higher levels because there's a leveraged effect of inflation with every layer that you go up for a constant ground-up inflation rate, there'll be more or higher inflation with each layer as you go up because of the layer below inflating into the higher layer. But we've been on this for some time. We've got some really talented actuaries that are working with our larger risks and we feel we were addressing it early-on from the beginning and that we're in a good position across the board. Thank you. I think we're in a good position. Personal lines across the board, it is sold a lot on a package -- in a package position. The first quarter was -- for current accident year was actually down a little bit from first quarter a year ago and pretty flat with the full year. So we feel we feel good about the pricing that we've been able to get-in auto, home and in the other lines. And we think it will reap benefits. And I think Steve's got a little to add-on. Yes, I think too, just the history of personal lines in general with the $795 million combined this year. Last year, we were over just a touch over $100 million and then it was what, the four prior years to 2023, we were under $100 million. So we've really -- I think we've demonstrated a history of being able to price personal lines pretty darn well across the spectrum as Steve mentions. Yes, they are. And I think that's very helpful in terms of the way we're underwriting the book. It is a severity issue that we're seeing there. Yes, we do. I think it's kind of across the board, Grace. I do think that higher pick is something that we would do in the first quarter.

Investment income growth continued at a strong pace, up 17% for the first quarter 2024 compared with the first quarter of 2023. Dividend income was up 9% for the quarter despite net equity security sales for the first three months of 2024 that totaled $40 million. Bond interest income grew 21% for the first quarter of this year. We continue to add more fixed maturity securities to our investment portfolio with net purchases totaling $374 million for the first three months of the year. The first quarter pre-tax average yield of 4.65% for the fixed maturity portfolio was up 40 basis points compared with last year. The average pre-tax yield for the total of purchased taxable and tax-exempt bonds during the first quarter of 2024 was 5.79%. Valuation changes in aggregate for the first quarter 2024 were favorable for our equity portfolio and unfavorable for our bond portfolio. Before tax effects, the net gain was $602 million for the equity portfolio, partially offset by a net loss of $65 million for the bond portfolio. At the end of the quarter, total investment portfolio net appreciated value was approximately $6.6 billion. The equity portfolio was in a net gain position of $7.2 billion, while the fixed maturity portfolio was in a net loss position of $625 million. Cash flow continued to benefit investment income in addition to higher bond yields. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2024 was $353 million, up 41% from a year ago. Our expense management objectives include an appropriate balance between controlling expenses and making strategic investments in our business. The first quarter 2024 property casualty underwriting expense ratio was 0.7 percentage points higher than last year, primarily related to higher levels of profit-sharing commissions for agencies. Regarding loss reserves, our approach remains consistent and aims for net amounts in the upper half of the actuarily estimated range of net loss and loss expense reserves. As we do each quarter, we consider new information such as paid losses and case reserves. Then we updated estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses by accident year and line of business. For the first three months of 2024, our net addition to property casualty loss expense reserves was $233 million, including $272 million for the IBNR portion. During the first quarter, we experienced $100 million of property casualty net favorable reserve development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 5.0 percentage points. Almost every line of business had favorable development except for commercial casualty, which was unfavorable by just $254,000. We added reserves to several older prior accident years and reduced reserves for the three most recent accident years. On an all lines basis by accident year, net reserve development for the first three months of 2024 included favorable $184 million for 2023, favorable $24 million for 2022 and an unfavorable $108 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2022. The unfavorable amount reflects our slowing the release of IBNR reserves for those older accident years. I'll conclude my comments with capital management highlights, another area where we have a consistent long-term approach. We paid $116 million in dividends to shareholders during the first quarter of 2024. We also repurchased 680,000 shares at an average price per share of $109.89. We think our financial flexibility and our financial strength are both in excellent shape. Parent company cash and marketable securities at quarter-end was nearly $5 billion. Debt-to-total capital continued to be under 10% and our quarter-end book value was a record high, $80.83 per share with $12.7 billion of GAAP consolidated shareholders' equity providing plenty of capacity for profitable growth of our insurance operations. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Steve. So, we're just continuing to see the same trends that we have been seeing with rates under pressure there, but also strong performance historically from the line. We are though recognizing the uncertainty that it comes with the rate decreases with a little bit higher loss pick for the current year. Thank you. For Cincinnati Global, same thing, strong 69.8%. They have had three consecutive years now as a top quartile Lloyd's underwriter and while they've done that, they've been diversifying in terms of their footprint by product line, by geography, and they're also providing an additional avenue for access to Lloyd's for the agents that are appointed by CIC. So a lot of positive at CGU reflected with strong results. And again, it's pretty tough at Lloyd's to be top quartile three years in a row the way they've done. Also this quarter, zero CATs versus 11.1 a year ago. And then the reserve development is favorable by 25.6 points this year versus adverse by 3.2 a year ago. So I think in both of those businesses, there's a ton of positive going on. And we've only pointed it out so that the math would be easier as you saw the consolidated CLD, the commercialized department, the personal lines and the excess and surplus and then to add the other portion to get to the consolidated. So yes, I think that we can balance the two. I think we feel good about our growth, double digit overall at 11%, really strong growth in Personal lines. And with each of our lines, we write it on a package basis for Commercial lines, and so there's going to be a little bit of variance between the different lines. But we think we are in a good place with our pricing, but we realize that you need to stick to adequate pricing. And you can't fall into a trap where if others are underpricing business that you follow that path. So we're going to maintain the discipline, charge the adequate rate on a on a risk by risk basis and we think that offers us plenty of opportunity to grow the company."
