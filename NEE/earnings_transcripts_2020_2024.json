With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Robo: Thanks, Jessica and good morning, everyone.  2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy\u2019s performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company. Across all of our businesses we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America\u2019s clean energy transformation.  By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019. A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.  Over the past ten years, we\u2019ve delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top ten power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period.  Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one year, three year, five year, seven year and ten year basis.  Over the past 15 years, we\u2019ve outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500, while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices.  While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.  NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past two years even beyond what we had anticipated. A combination of low cost renewable with low cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy.  We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents the potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.  In the Electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives.  In the Transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy.  And in the Industrial sector, grey hydrogen and other high carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives, as well as initiating other forms of policy support.  Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low cost, and financially successful, all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector in broader parts of the U.S. economy.  We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability.  We expect the disruptive nature of renewable to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.  FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives including placing more than 1100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan.  This solar expansion is part of FPL\u2019s Solar Together community solar program and its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan, which is one of the world\u2019s largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL\u2019s system by 2030.  Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world\u2019s largest integrated solar powered battery system is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021.  Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition, while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. FPL also had continued success with its cost saving initiatives making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt hour non-fuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020.  Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country. In addition to old builds, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the State of Florida, achieving its best ever reliability rate in 2020.  FPL\u2019s investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row, as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in six years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.  Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the two years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety, and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions.  Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018 and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019. In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continue to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years.  In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which is now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center. With the retirement of FPL\u2019s Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power.  Earlier this month, FPL filed the test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The four year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer term cost certainty for customers, while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.  The stability of multi-year rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business which is critical to keeping customer bills low, while at the same time enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet which allows for consistent access to the capital markets.  We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability, and clean energy for Floridians and our plan is to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.  Turning to Energy Resources, in 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 5750-megawatts of new projects more than doubling the amount of total renewable commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewable origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.  As a result of the team\u2019s origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 Gigawatts of new renewable in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, which if we are successful at the midpoint would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5 times the size of Energy Resources\u2019 entire operating renewable portfolio as of year-end 2019.  Energy Resources execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant committed advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites in interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation\u2019s generation fleet.  We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewable development environment we have ever seen.  Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there has been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance or ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe that it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources.  We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.  In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy\u2019s long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects.  Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings, we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return \u2013 unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020 further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables.  NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continued to deliver on its commitments that history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners enquired interests in approximately 1100-megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets including the Partnership\u2019s first battery storage project from Energy Resources.  Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first three organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275-megawatts of new projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grewitsL.P. distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio.  With this strong year-over-year growth and cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of yearend 2020.  In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth, and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources.  The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers L.P. unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition.  As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years.  Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy\u2019s employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic, and in amidst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees\u2019 unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled the yet another year of flawless execution in the business, while also delivering our best ever safety results across the company.  It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020, and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail. \nRebecca Kujawa : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.  Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL\u2019s net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion.  FPL\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper-end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year 2020 balance of $894 million.  Approximately, $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL\u2019s reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform provided significant customer benefits including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration cost since 2017.  Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation\u2019s largest ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL\u2019s Solar Together program, which is the nation\u2019s largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over the program\u2019s life. After commissioning over 1100 megawatts or more than 3.5 times the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional Solar Together capacity in 2021 and the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.  Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, we are in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic basin on record.  We\u2019ve delivered our best ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To-date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives.  As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time, while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.  Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which as a reminder was legally merged into FPL on January 1st 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis.  Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power\u2019s 19% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings. Gulf Power\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement.  For the full year 2021, we expect that regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions. All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power\u2019s first solar development project, the roughly 75-Megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime.  Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150-Megawatts of cost-effective zero emission solar capacity online later this year. The North Florida resiliency connection, which among other things will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across two different time zones is expected to be in service in mid-2022.  Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.  Additionally, Florida\u2019s most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.  We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.  During the quarter, FPL\u2019s average customer growth was strong increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL\u2019s fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth and underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL\u2019s retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison.  On a weather-normalized basis, FPL\u2019s retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year\u2019s retail sales were relatively muted and FPL\u2019s underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.  For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power\u2019s retail sales declined 3.3% primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year, as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.  As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next four years, 2022, through 2025 and provide customers longer term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023.  We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or silver mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900-megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.  For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida\u2019s economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low.  While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter, and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.  As we\u2019ve previously indicated, we plan to request the commission authorized unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the two businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through those operational savings and overall system benefits.  FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient \u2013 most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry bringing exceptional value to customers.  We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL\u2019s current superior value proposition and encourage strong \u2013 continued strong performance. In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets even in times of significant market disruptions in the aftermath of hurricanes, as well to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer our customers.  The total of these base rate increase requests over the four year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year. Today, FPL\u2019s typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average, if the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL\u2019s typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025.  To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022, that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms fifteen years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction that the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.  Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1000-kilowatt hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March.  The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission. But we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter and time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.  As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into six multi-year settlement agreements, that has provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition.  Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. And we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.  Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter was $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items none of which are particularly noteworthy.  For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share.  Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019, due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility.  Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.  Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history, as well as delivering our best year ever for originations, adding a net nearly 7000-Megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog.  In 2020, we commissioned about 5750-Megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2000-Megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog including approximately 1030-Megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670-Megawatts of solar, and 300-Megawatts of battery storage including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak storage, which is now expected to total 400-Megawatts and remains the world\u2019s largest standalone storage project.  Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500-Megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its yearend backlog by approximately 1500-Megawatts year-over-year providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead.  Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate. As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525-Megawatts to 12,700-Megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3500-Megawatts above our previous expectations.  Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past year-and-a-half.  We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150-Megawatts to 17,300-Megawatts. This is by far the largest expected two year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources\u2019 ongoing leadership position and renewables energy development. The accompanying slide provide some additional details.  As we\u2019ve previously discussed, we are optimistic about the we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project at Energy Resources that includes a 12-Megawatt solar array, onsite hydrogen production and storage, and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demands. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023. Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries to continue to develop clean energy solutions for a more efficient green production processes.  One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock to the facility and we are not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption further decarbonizing the facility's operations. In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to preserve \u2013 pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations, as well as providing energy management services.  This transaction is consistent with our toe in the water approach, as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector. We are excited about all of these opportunities, as well as the previously announced hydrogen pilot project, we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents.  Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.  Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management Right-of-Way Grants, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete.  While the Fourth Circuit denied the stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 Permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings. Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues, as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value and as a result, we have reflected a 1 to \u2013 $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings.  While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction timeline due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners. Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission, as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns three FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states.  We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share respectively.  For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the four-for-one stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter. For the Corporate and Other segments, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest in refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.  In total, for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges.  From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period respectively.  EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource.  For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top-end of the range we discussed going into 2020.  During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financings to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1100-Megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects.  As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing, that includes the acquired assets, plus four existing NextEra Energy Partners' wind and solar projects. Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of four existing NextEra Energy Partners' assets through the longest dated and lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders.  By leveraging the strong demand for high quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth, while enhancing returns for L.P. unitholders and limiting downside risk.  NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the Partnership's long-term growth. During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million units and 4.7 million units - common units respectively.  These conversions help NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.  Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible notes over the next five years.  NextEra Energy Partners' runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31st 2021 remain unchanged.  Year-end 2021 runrate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense.  From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer-term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board.  The progress we\u2019ve made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. \\ That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nSteve Fleishman : Yes. Couple questions. Just first \u2013 just a clean up on the MVP announcement. Could you just talk about, maybe a little more color on what you need to get that done and when and why? \nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. Thanks, Steve. And we appreciate the question. First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books, but really in relation to what we believe is the current fare on valuation for the investment given what we do still have to accomplish.  And obviously a lot changed in the fourth quarter including the nationwide 12 permits stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well as the various things that have happened in January and against a backdrop of obvious changes including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate which happened here in January.  So, the impairment does reflects our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. There was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate and we think we\u2019ve made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service.  So, as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we are going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We work closer with our partners to pursue that path. But we felt it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment. \nSteve Fleishman : Okay. And then, just on the continued higher growth in renewables, could you maybe just touch a little bit on funding plans for that over the period, just high level?\nRebecca Kujawa: Super high level. As you know, we\u2019ve prided ourselves in a variety of approaches to the capital markets to support our business retaining all of those options as circumstances change is one of the things that I think has been particularly successful for us over a long period of time. One aspect at this point I wouldn\u2019t expect to change, particularly as it relates to financing the projects of energy resources is that we will continue to execute a significant amount of tax equity, given our current position and tax capacity.  But I think it\u2019s all of the tools in the toolbox that you would expect us to utilize to finance the business. But our commitment to our strong balance sheet remains unchanged and we will grow both profitably and maintaining a strong balance sheet. \nSteve Fleishman : Great. And then, last, maybe, kind of a strategic question, I guess for Jim. Just the \u2013 as we see the continued \u2013 just dramatic ramp up in renewable growth and the revaluation of the company probably tied to that and what does it mean for some of the statements you\u2019ve made in the past on utility M&A? Does it make it more likely, because you need to balance the mix or less likely because there is just so much opportunity on this other side of the business? \nJim Robo: So, Steve, obviously, the relative valuation of the two big businesses has changed over the last several years, right? And that\u2019s just accelerated over \u2013 in particular over the last 24 months. I think what that means is it\u2019s changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility M&A.  On the one hand, I continue to believe that there is enormous value creation that we can bring to the table and you only need to look at what we\u2019ve been able to do with Gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation, bringing our playbook and our operating platform to bear can create, right?  So, that is \u2013 that I think remains clear and if anything is clear to me. On the other, I think it\u2019s also clear that, probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is, things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you are not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously and in our set of analytics, we are looking really more at how much value creation we bring to the table when we do this.  And so, for example, like at Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction. And something that we can finance in the normal course and a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.  And so, that\u2019s the kind of things that we are focused on and \u2013 but most importantly, we are focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in energy resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for benefit the state.  So, that I think is a \u2013 just a little different overview of how our current status of our thinking on. \nSteve Fleishman : Great. Okay. Thanks so much. \nOperator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. I\u2019ll make it brief. If I can, just coming back to renewable expectations, now redefined upsized expectations over the longer term here, can you talk about a few factors here? First, C&I, you guys haven\u2019t been as involved. It seems like that could be accelerating here. Can you talk about how that\u2019s sheltered into your expectations?  Secondly, the new expectations explicitly do not include any future build on transfer. How do you see that is incremental and any heuristics you might offer as to how to think about value creation there?  And a third one on that if I can just throw in there is the attach rates on storage. It seems like, the bulk of the storage that you are talking about in the future is probably tied to your solar assets. How do you think about standalone as being incremental to what you talk about already? I\u2019ll leave with that. \nRebecca Kujawa: Okay Julien, thanks for the questions and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers.  And if we look at our core base of other major investor on utilities, our munis and coops and our C&I business, other investor on utilities and muni coops are still large overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.  And I think what\u2019s really changed over the last year plus, maybe it\u2019s even two years is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging, how do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and therefore terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that that\u2019s a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.  In terms of build-own transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in a way that we\u2019ve shown that in the past that there will be some build-own transfer on the Energy Resources pursues, if it is a strict just sell the project to somebody else, we think there is a lot of value creation there, but we won\u2019t necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from.  So we\u2019ll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own transfers, as well as build-own transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.  And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we\u2019ve had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities, and even some standalone storage projects.  If there is a standalone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously that would support near-term growth of standalone storage opportunities even beyond what we\u2019ve seen. But the growth is terrific and as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.  And one last thing I\u2019ll highlight, Julien is, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the Solar Together program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that\u2019s what the Solar Together program offered is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured at the benefits both those participating customers and non-participating customers to meet their needs.  Don\u2019t mix up there Julien. Did I miss any aspect of it? \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Just the standalone piece. I mean, how incremental is that and to what your view? \nRebecca Kujawa: The standalone storage, as an investment opportunity? \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Yes, absolutely. \nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, over time, Julien, it could be very significant. In the short-term, is it imperative for renewables\u2019 growth, and in certain pockets, yes, broadly speaking, no. But as you start to see what we referenced today, trillions of dollars of renewable deployment over time increasing storage deployment both in the forms of batteries, as well as other forms of long duration storage which we believe includes hydrogen will become not only increasingly important, but a very large capital investment opportunity. \nJim Robo: Yes. And just to add, Julien, on what Rebecca said, I mean, Desert Peak, which we announced today 400 megawatts larger standalone project in the world. So, we are actively seeking out standalone opportunities and having the largest solar fleet in North America positions us for storage add-on. So, a tremendous amount of leverage up the operating fleet.  And with new origination, I think of attach rates being roughly 60% on all the new stuff that we do. And then, one more comment on C&I, we are positioning the business to be the preferred strategic partner with C&I customers.  And we are looking at the business in a holistic way where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board, it\u2019s wind, it\u2019s solar, it\u2019s storage, it\u2019s hydrogen, it\u2019s mobility, the First Student transaction that we just announced today. It\u2019s an energy management services capability. It\u2019s analytics. All the things we\u2019ve done for decades, we can now offer to C&I customers and we\u2019ve got a huge head start. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Great guys. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Julien. \nOperator: The next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. \nShar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. \nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Shar. \nShar Pourreza : Just a couple quick questions, on the rate case in particular, obviously, we have a March filing that\u2019s ahead of us. And one of the sort of the big moving piece is the rate base, it\u2019s 11% year-over-year growth for FPL, 24% for Gulf. As we sort of think about like the cap structure improvement especially for Gulf, the ROE add or the capital plan request, how do we sort of think about sort of the filing?  Does it kind of relates to your current growth guide as it\u2019s effective well within your current trajectory is like \u2013 is the filing consistent with the top end and extends the runway. Is it better? And more importantly, as we sort of think about you rolling forward the plan into 2024 is that kind of a post-GRC decision? \nRebecca Kujawa:\n. : From a NextEra Energy perspective, as you would expect, when we provide expectations, we do a variety of scenario planning analysis to feel comfortable with the expectations that we\u2019ve laid out. So, there is not one answer to what do you have in your assumptions that you\u2019ve laid for expectations. There is a range and we feel comfortable today as we\u2019ve obviously reiterated those expectations for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 timeframes.  So we look forward to presenting our case to the commission and shareholders. We feel very confident in the decisions that we\u2019ve made in terms of where we\u2019ve been investing, where we plan to invest. And obviously the results, into some measure obviously speaks for themselves in terms of low bills, high reliability, terrific customer service, and a clean energy profile that is substantial and we are obviously looking forward to not only telling that story, but also the Gulf changes over the last couple of years that Jim highlighted.  So, we\u2019ll have more as the process unfolds and obviously, when we have \u2013 we finally have clarity on the rate case outcome or a potential settlement if we are so fortunate as to reach a constructive agreement with interveners, we\u2019ll provide some updates once we have that information. \nShar Pourreza : Got it. And then, just as we think about rolling the consolidated outlook into 2021, is that a post-GRC decision or settlement? \nRebecca Kujawa: So, 2021 obviously assumes the current rate agreements, since both for FPL and Gulf, they go to see the 2021 timeframe. And then, 2022 and 2023, again I\u2019ll put in context a variety of scenarios that we assume for both FPL and Energy Resources to support the expectations that we\u2019ve laid out. \nShar Pourreza : Got it. And then, just maybe a quick strategy question for Jim. And Jim obviously, with Santee Cooper in particular, the sales discussions have been steadily growing and interest in the legislator. What do you sort of think will be different in 2021 either from the legislator side or the NEE side? I.e. would you sort of anticipate making a substantially similar bid if the process comes up for sale?  And then, just on for transmission, obviously you highlighted the GridLiance acquisition last year. How do you sort of see that opportunity set on the sort of transmission side? How large do you want NextEra Transmission to be as part of the business mix? Do you see any \u2013 is there more to come there? \nJim Robo: So, first of all on Santee Cooper, well, there is an offer on the table and that offer remains on the table and as does our $25 million deposit, which the state still has. So, the offer is there and we are ready to negotiate whenever the state is ready to get going. And so, we stand ready and are hopeful that the legislator will move forward on that process. And we\u2019ll know more obviously over the next 90 days or so.  On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think, Rebecca in her prepared remarks had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch, little over ten years ago and it\u2019s a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions and we are pursuing other acquisitions there, because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.  And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewable in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the Federal government or state governments to get renewable builds. It\u2019s not that customers don\u2019t want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country.  And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business I think is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world and it is also, I think every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower cost renewable even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would.  So, I am very excited about transmission business. We are going to continue to push it and I think it\u2019s got a lot of runway to grow. \nShar Pourreza : Terrific. Thanks for that. And congrats on the results. \nOperator: The next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nMichael Lapides : Thank you for taking my question. I actually have two. One is, your post-integrate 2020 with EPS growth north of 10%, just curious, do you think you could potentially come in above the high end of your range? So is kind of the 6% to 8% target a very modest target growth when you think about the next couple of years given the runrate you hit this past year? \nRebecca Kujawa: So, Michael, I appreciate and I appreciate the optimism and the support that that your question might suggest. We are really proud of the results for 2020. There is a couple of things to remind you. One, that does include some incremental contributions from Gulf and obviously we expected Gulf in the deal for our Florida acquisitions and we expect some incremental benefit from that for 2021 as we highlighted in the \u2013 when we laid out expectations initially.  And then, just recall, we did raised our 2021 expectations late last year and the rebased our 6% to 8% off of that higher base. We are really excited about both the positioning of the regulated utilities, as well as Energy Resources going into 2021. We know what we need to accomplish and the teams are set out to go after and achieve those objectives. And of course, we\u2019ll update you over time as we go through the year. But for today, we have reiterated those expectations of the $2.40 to $2.54 for 2021. \nMichael Lapides : Got it. And then, a follow-up one and it\u2019s more of a policy one and I think it\u2019s more of the state policy one. There is still lots of coal generation in rate base in a lot of states. Not all of which probably is economic.  But the owners of that and clearly your Florida utility don\u2019t have exposure to this. The owners of that benefit from having a rate base. How do you, from an earnings perspective, how do you think that dichotomy, Jim, gets resolved over time? And are there lessons that other states can learn from Florida that might be able to haze in the pace of fleet transformation? \nJim Robo: So, Michael, I think you are being kind honestly to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today full period and stop when it\u2019s dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay. And so, why haven\u2019t it \u2013 I think you\u2019ve hit on the crux of some of the issues.  Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to what our utility customers retire the coal plant and then will be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don\u2019t want to retire an asset that you are going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?  I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment and Florida Commission\u2019s view on a modernizing generation fleet is that they have \u2013 we\u2019ve spread that capital recovery over a period of five or ten years. And that has both I think moderated the impact of customer builds on the one hand and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower cost generation.  So, I think it\u2019s about \u2013 the other piece I think that\u2019s going to change is, there is no question this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so, there is going to be, I think more pressure, more Federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously over the last four years where there has been, in fact, the opposite of Federal pressure.  But the complete lack of Federal pressure do anything about with your coal fleet. So, I think the combination of that, plus states becoming \u2013 it become clear and clear the economics as we go along that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewable with storage is that becomes even clearer as cost come down.  For renewables when cost continue to go up, for operating cost continue to go up for coal, that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, the bottom-line, in Florida, we\u2019ve shut our coal down and we save customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation that we\u2019ve put in place. So, there is an enormous opportunity.  There is several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity, because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that\u2019s going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country and it should be, because there is no \u2013 it costing customers\u2019 money.  Leave aside the environmental benefits just on pure economics that costing customers\u2019 money every day and that\u2019s bad for the country and let alone that it\u2019s terrible for the climate. It is \u2013 and for the environment, it is bad for customers, because economics are - the coal economics are so what a whack. \nMichael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated. And maybe one last one for Rebecca. Rebecca you outraced your renewable growth targets materially that implies higher CapEx, but obviously you get the benefit of the tax every year. So you all utilize convertible financing or equity units. Should we assume that as part of your EPS growth guidance that there is continued use of kind of new convertible units in the financing plan and maybe that level grows and scale with the change in the CapEx forecast? \nRebecca Kujawa: Michael, I appreciate it. And I\u2019ve talking to a couple of comments that we\u2019ve made in the past that I know you know. First, we keep all the tools in the toolkit and we believe that at various times, various tools are more economic than others. But at the end of the day, our commitment to our balance sheet remains very strong and that we will finance it in a way that retains our strong balance sheet.  One additional thing I\u2019ll remind you of that over time is certainly been very valuable to you is, not only maintaining the balance in our business, which we\u2019ve talked about frequently. But if the recycling a capital as a source of proceeds to finance that new growth and as NEP grows and our recycling of capital grows to NEP, obviously, that\u2019s also a source of financing from the new investments that Energy Resources is making.  But there was one thing that I know at the beginning of the year, we have a financing plan by the end of the year. It ends up being different than what we originally thought. But again, the most important thing to us is no matter what, we will remain committed to that balance sheet and we will finance it in a way that makes sense and it is ultimately profitable for our shareholders as well. \nMichael Lapides : Got it.

            "name": "Jim Robo",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica and good morning, everyone.  2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company. Across all of our businesses we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America's clean energy transformation.  By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019. A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders.  Over the past ten years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top ten power companies who have achieved on average compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period.  Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a one year, three year, five year, seven year and ten year basis.  Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500, while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices.  While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.  NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past two years even beyond what we had anticipated. A combination of low cost renewable with low cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy.  We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents the potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.  In the Electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives.  In the Transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy.  And in the Industrial sector, grey hydrogen and other high carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives, as well as initiating other forms of policy support.  Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low cost, and financially successful, all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector in broader parts of the U.S. economy.  We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability.  We expect the disruptive nature of renewable to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.  FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives including placing more than 1100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan.  This solar expansion is part of FPL's Solar Together community solar program and its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL's system by 2030.  Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar powered battery system is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021.  Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition, while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. FPL also had continued success with its cost saving initiatives making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt hour non-fuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020.  Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country. In addition to old builds, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the State of Florida, achieving its best ever reliability rate in 2020.  FPL's investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row, as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in six years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.  Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the two years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety, and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions.  Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018 and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019. In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continue to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years.  In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which is now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center. With the retirement of FPL's Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power.  Earlier this month, FPL filed the test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The four year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer term cost certainty for customers, while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.  The stability of multi-year rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business which is critical to keeping customer bills low, while at the same time enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet which allows for consistent access to the capital markets.  We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability, and clean energy for Floridians and our plan is to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.  Turning to Energy Resources, in 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects commissioning approximately 5750-megawatts of new projects more than doubling the amount of total renewable commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewable origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.  As a result of the team's origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 Gigawatts of new renewable in the 2021 to 2024 timeframe, which if we are successful at the midpoint would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5 times the size of Energy Resources' entire operating renewable portfolio as of year-end 2019.  Energy Resources execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant committed advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites in interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation's generation fleet.  We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewable development environment we have ever seen.  Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there has been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance or ESG on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe that it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources.  We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.  In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects.  Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings, we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return \u2013 unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020 further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables.  NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continued to deliver on its commitments that history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners enquired interests in approximately 1100-megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets including the Partnership's first battery storage project from Energy Resources.  Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first three organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275-megawatts of new projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grewitsL.P. distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio.  With this strong year-over-year growth and cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12 month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of yearend 2020.  In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth, and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources.  The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers L.P. unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition.  As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years.  Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy's employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic, and in amidst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees' unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled the yet another year of flawless execution in the business, while also delivering our best ever safety results across the company.  It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020, and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail. So, Steve, obviously, the relative valuation of the two big businesses has changed over the last several years, right? And that's just accelerated over \u2013 in particular over the last 24 months. I think what that means is it's changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility M&A.  On the one hand, I continue to believe that there is enormous value creation that we can bring to the table and you only need to look at what we've been able to do with Gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation, bringing our playbook and our operating platform to bear can create, right?  So, that is \u2013 that I think remains clear and if anything is clear to me. On the other, I think it's also clear that, probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is, things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you are not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously and in our set of analytics, we are looking really more at how much value creation we bring to the table when we do this.  And so, for example, like at Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That's a \u2013 it's a roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction. And something that we can finance in the normal course and a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.  And so, that's the kind of things that we are focused on and \u2013 but most importantly, we are focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in energy resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for benefit the state.  So, that I think is a \u2013 just a little different overview of how our current status of our thinking on. Yes. And just to add, Julien, on what Rebecca said, I mean, Desert Peak, which we announced today 400 megawatts larger standalone project in the world. So, we are actively seeking out standalone opportunities and having the largest solar fleet in North America positions us for storage add-on. So, a tremendous amount of leverage up the operating fleet.  And with new origination, I think of attach rates being roughly 60% on all the new stuff that we do. And then, one more comment on C&I, we are positioning the business to be the preferred strategic partner with C&I customers.  And we are looking at the business in a holistic way where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board, it's wind, it's solar, it's storage, it's hydrogen, it's mobility, the First Student transaction that we just announced today. It's an energy management services capability. It's analytics. All the things we've done for decades, we can now offer to C&I customers and we've got a huge head start. So, first of all on Santee Cooper, well, there is an offer on the table and that offer remains on the table and as does our $25 million deposit, which the state still has. So, the offer is there and we are ready to negotiate whenever the state is ready to get going. And so, we stand ready and are hopeful that the legislator will move forward on that process. And we'll know more obviously over the next 90 days or so.  On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think, Rebecca in her prepared remarks had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch, little over ten years ago and it's a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions and we are pursuing other acquisitions there, because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.  And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewable in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the Federal government or state governments to get renewable builds. It's not that customers don't want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country.  And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business I think is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world and it is also, I think every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower cost renewable even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would.  So, I am very excited about transmission business. We are going to continue to push it and I think it's got a lot of runway to grow. So, Michael, I think you are being kind honestly to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today full period and stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay. And so, why haven't it \u2013 I think you've hit on the crux of some of the issues.  Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to what our utility customers retire the coal plant and then will be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don't want to retire an asset that you are going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?  I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment and Florida Commission's view on a modernizing generation fleet is that they have \u2013 we've spread that capital recovery over a period of five or ten years. And that has both I think moderated the impact of customer builds on the one hand and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower cost generation.  So, I think it's about \u2013 the other piece I think that's going to change is, there is no question this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so, there is going to be, I think more pressure, more Federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously over the last four years where there has been, in fact, the opposite of Federal pressure.  But the complete lack of Federal pressure do anything about with your coal fleet. So, I think the combination of that, plus states becoming \u2013 it become clear and clear the economics as we go along that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewable with storage is that becomes even clearer as cost come down.  For renewables when cost continue to go up, for operating cost continue to go up for coal, that's \u2013 I mean, the bottom-line, in Florida, we've shut our coal down and we save customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation that we've put in place. So, there is an enormous opportunity.  There is several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity, because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that's going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country and it should be, because there is no \u2013 it costing customers' money.  Leave aside the environmental benefits just on pure economics that costing customers' money every day and that's bad for the country and let alone that it's terrible for the climate. It is \u2013 and for the environment, it is bad for customers, because economics are - the coal economics are so what a whack."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.  Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion.  FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper-end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year 2020 balance of $894 million.  Approximately, $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL's reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform provided significant customer benefits including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration cost since 2017.  Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's Solar Together program, which is the nation's largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over the program's life. After commissioning over 1100 megawatts or more than 3.5 times the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional Solar Together capacity in 2021 and the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.  Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, we are in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic basin on record.  We've delivered our best ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To-date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives.  As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time, while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.  Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which as a reminder was legally merged into FPL on January 1st 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis.  Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power's 19% year-over-year growth and adjusted earnings. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement.  For the full year 2021, we expect that regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band assuming normal weather and operating conditions. All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-Megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime.  Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150-Megawatts of cost-effective zero emission solar capacity online later this year. The North Florida resiliency connection, which among other things will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across two different time zones is expected to be in service in mid-2022.  Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.  Additionally, Florida's most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.  We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.  During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth and underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL's retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison.  On a weather-normalized basis, FPL's retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year's retail sales were relatively muted and FPL's underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.  For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power's retail sales declined 3.3% primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year, as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.  As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next four years, 2022, through 2025 and provide customers longer term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023.  We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or silver mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900-megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.  For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low.  While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter, and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.  As we've previously indicated, we plan to request the commission authorized unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the two businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through those operational savings and overall system benefits.  FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient \u2013 most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry bringing exceptional value to customers.  We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage strong \u2013 continued strong performance. In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets even in times of significant market disruptions in the aftermath of hurricanes, as well to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer our customers.  The total of these base rate increase requests over the four year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year. Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average, if the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL's typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025.  To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022, that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms fifteen years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction that the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.  Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1000-kilowatt hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March.  The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the commission. But we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter and time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.  As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into six multi-year settlement agreements, that has provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition.  Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. And we will continue to provide updates throughout the process.  Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter was $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items none of which are particularly noteworthy.  For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share.  Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019, due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility.  Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.  Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history, as well as delivering our best year ever for originations, adding a net nearly 7000-Megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog.  In 2020, we commissioned about 5750-Megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2000-Megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog including approximately 1030-Megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670-Megawatts of solar, and 300-Megawatts of battery storage including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak storage, which is now expected to total 400-Megawatts and remains the world's largest standalone storage project.  Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500-Megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its yearend backlog by approximately 1500-Megawatts year-over-year providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead.  Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate. As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525-Megawatts to 12,700-Megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3500-Megawatts above our previous expectations.  Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past year-and-a-half.  We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150-Megawatts to 17,300-Megawatts. This is by far the largest expected two year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and renewables energy development. The accompanying slide provide some additional details.  As we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project at Energy Resources that includes a 12-Megawatt solar array, onsite hydrogen production and storage, and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demands. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023. Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries to continue to develop clean energy solutions for a more efficient green production processes.  One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock to the facility and we are not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption further decarbonizing the facility's operations. In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to preserve \u2013 pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations, as well as providing energy management services.  This transaction is consistent with our toe in the water approach, as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector. We are excited about all of these opportunities, as well as the previously announced hydrogen pilot project, we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents.  Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.  Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management Right-of-Way Grants, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete.  While the Fourth Circuit denied the stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 Permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings. Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues, as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value and as a result, we have reflected a 1 to \u2013 $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings.  While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction timeline due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners. Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission, as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns three FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states.  We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share respectively.  For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the four-for-one stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter. For the Corporate and Other segments, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest in refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.  In total, for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges.  From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period respectively.  EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource.  For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top-end of the range we discussed going into 2020.  During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financings to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1100-Megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects.  As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing, that includes the acquired assets, plus four existing NextEra Energy Partners' wind and solar projects. Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of four existing NextEra Energy Partners' assets through the longest dated and lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders.  By leveraging the strong demand for high quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth, while enhancing returns for L.P. unitholders and limiting downside risk.  NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the Partnership's long-term growth. During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million units and 4.7 million units - common units respectively.  These conversions help NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.  Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible notes over the next five years.  NextEra Energy Partners' runrate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31st 2021 remain unchanged.  Year-end 2021 runrate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense.  From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer-term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board.  The progress we've made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. \\ That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions. Sure. Thanks, Steve. And we appreciate the question. First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books, but really in relation to what we believe is the current fare on valuation for the investment given what we do still have to accomplish.  And obviously a lot changed in the fourth quarter including the nationwide 12 permits stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as well as the various things that have happened in January and against a backdrop of obvious changes including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate which happened here in January.  So, the impairment does reflects our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. There was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate and we think we've made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service.  So, as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we are going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We work closer with our partners to pursue that path. But we felt it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment. Super high level. As you know, we've prided ourselves in a variety of approaches to the capital markets to support our business retaining all of those options as circumstances change is one of the things that I think has been particularly successful for us over a long period of time. One aspect at this point I wouldn't expect to change, particularly as it relates to financing the projects of energy resources is that we will continue to execute a significant amount of tax equity, given our current position and tax capacity.  But I think it's all of the tools in the toolbox that you would expect us to utilize to finance the business. But our commitment to our strong balance sheet remains unchanged and we will grow both profitably and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Okay Julien, thanks for the questions and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers.  And if we look at our core base of other major investor on utilities, our munis and coops and our C&I business, other investor on utilities and muni coops are still large overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.  And I think what's really changed over the last year plus, maybe it's even two years is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging, how do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and therefore terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that that's a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.  In terms of build-own transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in a way that we've shown that in the past that there will be some build-own transfer on the Energy Resources pursues, if it is a strict just sell the project to somebody else, we think there is a lot of value creation there, but we won't necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from.  So we'll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own transfers, as well as build-own transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.  And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we've had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities, and even some standalone storage projects.  If there is a standalone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously that would support near-term growth of standalone storage opportunities even beyond what we've seen. But the growth is terrific and as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.  And one last thing I'll highlight, Julien is, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the Solar Together program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that's what the Solar Together program offered is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured at the benefits both those participating customers and non-participating customers to meet their needs.  Don't mix up there Julien. Did I miss any aspect of it? The standalone storage, as an investment opportunity? Yes, over time, Julien, it could be very significant. In the short-term, is it imperative for renewables' growth, and in certain pockets, yes, broadly speaking, no. But as you start to see what we referenced today, trillions of dollars of renewable deployment over time increasing storage deployment both in the forms of batteries, as well as other forms of long duration storage which we believe includes hydrogen will become not only increasingly important, but a very large capital investment opportunity. Thanks, Julien. Good morning, Shar. .:From a NextEra Energy perspective, as you would expect, when we provide expectations, we do a variety of scenario planning analysis to feel comfortable with the expectations that we've laid out. So, there is not one answer to what do you have in your assumptions that you've laid for expectations. There is a range and we feel comfortable today as we've obviously reiterated those expectations for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 timeframes.  So we look forward to presenting our case to the commission and shareholders. We feel very confident in the decisions that we've made in terms of where we've been investing, where we plan to invest. And obviously the results, into some measure obviously speaks for themselves in terms of low bills, high reliability, terrific customer service, and a clean energy profile that is substantial and we are obviously looking forward to not only telling that story, but also the Gulf changes over the last couple of years that Jim highlighted.  So, we'll have more as the process unfolds and obviously, when we have \u2013 we finally have clarity on the rate case outcome or a potential settlement if we are so fortunate as to reach a constructive agreement with interveners, we'll provide some updates once we have that information. So, 2021 obviously assumes the current rate agreements, since both for FPL and Gulf, they go to see the 2021 timeframe. And then, 2022 and 2023, again I'll put in context a variety of scenarios that we assume for both FPL and Energy Resources to support the expectations that we've laid out. So, Michael, I appreciate and I appreciate the optimism and the support that that your question might suggest. We are really proud of the results for 2020. There is a couple of things to remind you. One, that does include some incremental contributions from Gulf and obviously we expected Gulf in the deal for our Florida acquisitions and we expect some incremental benefit from that for 2021 as we highlighted in the \u2013 when we laid out expectations initially.  And then, just recall, we did raised our 2021 expectations late last year and the rebased our 6% to 8% off of that higher base. We are really excited about both the positioning of the regulated utilities, as well as Energy Resources going into 2021. We know what we need to accomplish and the teams are set out to go after and achieve those objectives. And of course, we'll update you over time as we go through the year. But for today, we have reiterated those expectations of the $2.40 to $2.54 for 2021. Michael, I appreciate it. And I've talking to a couple of comments that we've made in the past that I know you know. First, we keep all the tools in the toolkit and we believe that at various times, various tools are more economic than others. But at the end of the day, our commitment to our balance sheet remains very strong and that we will finance it in a way that retains our strong balance sheet.  One additional thing I'll remind you of that over time is certainly been very valuable to you is, not only maintaining the balance in our business, which we've talked about frequently. But if the recycling a capital as a source of proceeds to finance that new growth and as NEP grows and our recycling of capital grows to NEP, obviously, that's also a source of financing from the new investments that Energy Resources is making.  But there was one thing that I know at the beginning of the year, we have a financing plan by the end of the year. It ends up being different than what we originally thought. But again, the most important thing to us is no matter what, we will remain committed to that balance sheet and we will finance it in a way that makes sense and it is ultimately profitable for our shareholders as well. Thank you very much, Michael."

NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and continue to perform well on managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NextEra Energy\u2019s third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior-year comparable quarter, reflecting strong execution at Florida Power & Light Company, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Year-to-date, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by over 10% relative to 2019. We continue to execute well on our major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history and we are well positioned to meet our overall objectives for 2020 and beyond. Before moving on, I would like to say a few words about hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Sally and Delta. As you know, residents throughout the eastern and southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of these dangerous and deadly storms. Our deepest sympathies are with those, who have been impacted by these storms widespread destruction. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent several thousand of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. Gulf Power itself was impacted by Hurricane Sally, which experienced an unexpected change in intensity and path before striking the service area. Approximately, 285,000 customers or more than 60% of Gulf Power\u2019s customers experienced outages as Sally brought heavy rain and severe flooding. Through a restoration workforce that totaled approximately 7,000 workers, including approximately 2,000 FPL employees and contractors. Gulf Power was able to restore service to essentially all impacted customers within five days. We are pleased with the efficient and safe restoration response to Hurricane Sally, which was made more challenging by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus on preparation and execution, including our annual storm drills helped ensure a timely response to the hurricane despite the pandemic. At Florida Power & Light earnings per share increased $0.14 year-over-year. All of the major capital projects including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S. remain on track as we continue to advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. FPL\u2019s typical residential bill remains 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities. All while FPL maintains best-in-class service reliability and an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. As part of our continued focus on doing what is right for our customers, last month, FPL announced that among other measures, it was offering direct relief of up to $200 per customer to those that are experiencing hardship and are significantly behind on their bills due to COVID-19. We remain committed to supporting our customers during this challenging time. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution as we continue to deliver on the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we have previously outlined. We remained focused on improving the Gulf Power customer value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions, and continue to expect that this strategy will generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 23% year-over-year, building upon the success of recent quarters, our development team had the best quarter of origination in Energy Resources\u2019 history, adding nearly 2,200 megawatts of signed contracts to our renewables backlog. After accounting for the removal of several projects, which I\u2019ll talk about more in a moment, our backlog increased by approximately 1,450 megawatts, and now totaled more than 15,000 megawatts. To put this into perspective, our backlog, which we continue to expect and expect to construct over the next several years is now larger than Energy Resources entire existing renewables portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute, commissioning more than 800 megawatts since the last earnings call and keeping the remainder of the \u2013 more than 5,200 total megawatts of wind and solar projects that we\u2019re expecting to complete this year on track to achieve their 2020 in-service dates. Overall, with three quarters complete in 2020, we are pleased with the progress we are making in NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we\u2019ve previously discussed, subject to our normal caveats. Now, let\u2019s look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. With the third quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $757 million or $1.54 per share, an increase of $74 million and $0.14 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL\u2019s net income growth of roughly 11%. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion during the third quarter and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, which as a reminder, is higher than our expectations at the start of the year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending September 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we restored $258 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $994 million. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, we expect FPL and Gulf Power operating as a single larger Florida utility company will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive for \u2013 approval for an internal reorganization, whereby Gulf will merge into FPL in January of 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate operating division during 2021 serving its customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies will file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January of 2022. Turning to our development efforts. all of our major capital initiatives at FPL are progressing well. The next six SolarTogether projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,600 megawatts community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. This significant solar expansion combined with low-cost battery storage solutions such as Manatee Energy Storage Center that remains on track to be complete next year represent the next phase of FPL\u2019s generation modernization efforts. Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remain on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its commercial \u2013 projected commercial operations date in 2022. During the quarter, we are pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL\u2019s Storm Protection Plan settlement agreement that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. The agreement supports the continued hardening of FPL\u2019s already storm-resilient energy grid in a programmatic manner through the deployment of billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $91 million or $0.18 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share relative to Gulf Power\u2019s adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period. Gulf Power\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.5% for the 12 months ending September 2020. For the full-year 2020, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power\u2019s capital expenditures were roughly $350 million and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf Power\u2019s major smart capital investments continue to progress well. The Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion and associated natural gas laterals are expected to be complete later this year, supporting NextEra Energy\u2019s coal phase-out strategy and commitment to remain a clean energy leader. Although Gulf Power has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of the Hurricane Sally recoverable storm restoration costs is roughly $200 million. The storm restoration costs have been deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on Gulf Power\u2019s balance sheet. Under the terms of Gulf Power\u2019s current rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the Florida Public Service Commission and subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm costs, Gulf Power is authorized to recover storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through a surcharge. Similar to FPL, Gulf Power\u2019s Storm Protection Plan settlement agreement was also approved during the quarter. We expect that these future hardening investments will lead to a stronger and more storm-resilient grid at Gulf Power and support an even more rapid recovery from storms in the future. Similar to other parts in the country, the Florida economy continues to recover from the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects an improvement in the Florida unemployment rate since the start of the pandemic and an increase in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes to the national averages of each metric. We continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound as we move beyond the pandemic. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL\u2019s average customer growth was particularly strong, increasing by nearly $80,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL\u2019s third quarter retail sales increased 2.8% year-over-year as customer growth, weather and underlying usage per customer all contributed favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power\u2019s third quarter retail sales declined 6.7% year-over-year, primarily as a result of unfavorable weather comparison relative to the particularly strong third quarter last year and a decline in underlying usage, primarily associated with Hurricane Sally. At both FPL and Gulf Power, third quarter weather-normalized retail sales were roughly in line with our expectations at the start of the year, and we do not believe that the pandemic had much of an overall impact on underlying usage. At FPL, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism will offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support a regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $376 million or $0.76 per share and adjusted earnings of $551 million or $1.12 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 or approximately 23% from last year\u2019s comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission business, formerly reported in corporate and other. New investments attributed $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program. The contribution from existing generation assets was flat year-over-year as the decline in wind resource and costs associated with the retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility were roughly offset by increased PTC volume from our repowered wind projects as well as the lack of an unfavorable state tax item, which impacted last year\u2019s third quarter results. Contributions from both NextEra Transmission and our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.01 year-over-year. All other impacts increased results by $0.13 per share, driven primarily by the absence of the write-off of development costs, the negatively impacted 2019 results. The Energy Resources development team continued to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the quarter, with the team originating a record of nearly 2,200 megawatts. Since our last earnings call we have added 580 megawatts of new wind, 911 megawatts of solar, 594 megawatts of battery storage and 86 megawatts of wind repowering. The significant additions include a new 325 megawatts four-hour battery storage system. This project which is the largest standalone storage project in the world is expected to support California\u2019s aggressive clean energy goals and help improve reliability across the regional electric grid when it comes online in 2023. We also executed 180 megawatts solar build-own-transfer agreement during the quarter, which is not included in our backlog additions. Partially offsetting this quarter\u2019s strong origination success was the removal of several projects we had previously included in our backlog. A majority of the reductions are the result of an unfavorable ruling from the Alabama Public Service Commission related to several solar plus storage projects. We expect the customer to hold a future procurement for this generation capacity, and are hopeful that the projects may receive new contracts during that process. After accounting for these projects, removals the Energy Resources backlog had a net increase of 1,446 megawatts during the quarter. Reflective of our customer demand for low-cost wind, solar and battery storage projects that is stronger than ever. The repowering projects added this quarter include our first project for beyond 2020, and adds to the recent significant increase to our 2021 new wind and repowering backlog, which now totals roughly 2,000 megawatts. With the addition of the 2021 repowering project we are now introducing repowering expectations for 2021 and 2022 period of 200 megawatts to 700 megawatts. Continued cost and technology improvements have supported an expanding opportunity set for both new wind and repowering over time. As a result, we are beginning to evaluate incremental repowering opportunities for beyond 2022. Through the first three quarters of 2020 we have added nearly 4,800 megawatts to our renewables backlog, which now totals more than 15,000 megawatts and is the largest in our history. To reflect the current backlog and strong origination success we are raising the low end of our 2019 through 2022 development expectations to 15,500 megawatts, which is above the midpoint of our original range. And we are increasing the top end of the expectations to reflect the incremental repowering expectations that we added this quarter. Additionally, with more than 4,000 megawatts of renewables projects already in our backlog for post 2022 we are well positioned to execute on our long-term growth objectives. We continue to believe that by leveraging Energy Resources\u2019 competitive advantages, we can further capitalize on the best renewables development environment in our history going forward. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, we are optimistic about the potential for green hydrogen to support an emissions-free future. Consistent with our toe in the water approach to new opportunities Energy Resources has developed a pipeline of approximately 50 potential green hydrogen projects spanning the power, transportation and industrial sectors. These projects serve a variety of end uses, and similar to the strategy employed in wind, solar, battery storage and other areas, provide the opportunity to develop early learnings with relatively small investments to set the stage for much larger capital deployment as cost declines and technology improvements are realized. Over the next several quarters we expect to add to this pipeline, while advancing select projects as we position ourselves to continue to be a leader in the decarbonization of the energy sector. We remain excited about hydrogen\u2019s long-term potential to further support future demand for low-cost renewables, as well as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks. Beyond renewables, we are pleased with the recent progress to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for Mountain Valley Pipeline\u2019s construction. Among other progress since the last earnings call, MVP has received its revised biological opinion, approval of the project\u2019s nationwide 12 permit by the Army Corps of Engineers and a recent order by FERC authorizing forward construction to resume along the majority of the project route. Following receipt of this approval, MVP resumed construction work across West Virginia and Virginia. Despite the recent progress we were disappointed with the Fourth Circuit Court\u2019s decisions to administratively stay MVP\u2019s nationwide 12 permit. We disagree with the court\u2019s decision and continue to work with our partners to move the project forward. Depending on the outcome of these issues, we continue to target an in-service date of the pipeline for during 2021. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate-regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter NextEra Energy Transmission announced an agreement to acquire Grid Lines, which owns three FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states. Subject to regulatory approvals, the approximately $660 million acquisition, including the assumption of debt is expected to close in 2021, and to be immediately accretive to earnings. The proposed acquisition has strong expansion potential and attractive markets with significant expected renewables growth, and furthers our goal of growing America\u2019s leading competitive transmission company. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2020 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.229 billion or $2.50 share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2020 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.311 billion and $2.66 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment declined $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to other corporate expenses, which includes interest. During the quarter NextEra Energy issued $2 billion of equity units as we continue to focus on opportunistic and prudent capital management to enhance the strength of our balance sheet. The equity units will convert to common equity in 2023. And the proceeds are expected to be primarily used to redeem a portion of NextEra Energy\u2019s outstanding hybrid securities and to finance the acquisition of GridLiance and NextEra Energy\u2019s continued renewables expansion. In addition to the redemption of hybrid securities in the fourth quarter, we are also considering several other potential refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In total, these initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of roughly $0.20 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Consistent with our efforts to position NextEra Energy well for long-term growth and take advantage of the low interest rate environment, during the quarter, we entered into $2 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps to further support future debt issuances. Finally, in July, as part of its 2020 annual review, Moody\u2019s reduced NextEra Energy\u2019s CFO pre-working capital-to-debt downgrade threshold from 18% to 17%. The favorable adjustment was based on recognition of NextEra Energy\u2019s leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors and stable cash flow generation profile. As we announced last month, based on the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and continued execution across all of our businesses, we increased NextEra Energy\u2019s financial expectations for 2021 and 2022, and extended our long-term growth outlook to 2023. For 2021, NextEra Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS expectation ranges increased by $0.20, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10.15. For 2022 and 2023, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share. The increased adjusted earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry, largely as a result of the significant renewables investment opportunities that we expect to capitalize on, we now expect our total capital expenditures from 2019 to 2022, to total roughly $60 billion, an increase from the $50 billion to $55 billion range we introduced at the Investor Conference last year. During the quarter, the Board of NextEra Energy approved a four-for-one common stock split, which is intended to make stock ownership more accessible to a broader base of investors. Trading will begin on a stock split adjusted basis on October 27. And our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results will reflect the post split share count. As a result of the stock split NextEra Energy updated its adjusted EPS ranges to reflect the increase in its \u2013 in outstanding shares. In 2020, the company now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.30. The adjusted EPS ranges for 2021 and beyond are included on the accompanying slide. from 2018 to 2023, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of the 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, despite the challenges created by COVID-19 pandemic, NextEra Energy has continued to deliver terrific operational and financial results through the first three quarters of 2020. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and our strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020, 2021, 2022 and now 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution, and believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned to drive shareholder value in the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio performed well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was down slightly compared to the third quarter of 2019 and cash available for distribution increased 10% versus the prior year comparable quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 16% and 50% respectively, versus 2019. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.595 per common unit, or $2.38 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. During September, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt into roughly 5.7 million common units. This financing, combined with a related capped call, that NextEra Energy Partners entered into at the time of the debt issuance, generated significant value for LP unitholders. Following receipt of the capped call settlement, the debt had roughly $0 three-year cumulative cash cost. Relative to issuing equity at the time of the financing, 25% fewer units were issued. And NextEra Energy Partners generated approximately $50 million in cumulative cash savings. The convertible debt financing highlights the value of NextEra Energy Partners, utilizing low-cost financing products to support growth and efficiently issue equity over time. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and are well positioned to meet our 2020 and longer-term expectations. Now, let\u2019s look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $312 million, a decline of approximately 1% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $162 million, up approximately 10% from the prior-year comparable quarter. new projects added $24 million of adjusted EBITDA and $16 million of cash available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA from the existing assets declined year-over-year as lower wind resource was partially offset by growth at the Texas pipelines as a result of the expansion project going into service. Wind resource was 96% of long-term average versus a particularly strong 107% in the third quarter of 2019. cash available for distribution from existing projects benefited from a reduction in debt service payments, primarily as a result of the retirement of outstanding notes at our Genesis project and receipt of higher year-over-year PAYGO payments. The reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. The additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. We are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed its first two organic growth investments ahead of schedule and on budget. The repowering of the 175 megawatt Northern Colorado wind project was recently placed into service. The repowering provides multiple benefits to NextEra Energy Partners, including increased production, an uplift in project cash flow, a longer asset life and lower O&M costs. The remaining 100 megawatts of wind repowering, remains on track to be in service later this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the backup compression capacity on the Texas pipelines also reached commercial operation. The expansion opportunity is supported by a long-term contract and is expected to deliver attractive returns to LP unitholders. The ability to complete these projects as planned, despite the challenges created by the pandemic is a testament to the best-in-class engineering and construction team that NextEra Energy partners is able to leverage to execute its organic investments. We continue to expect to execute on additional attractive organic growth opportunities as the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio further expands. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 expectations, which remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, and cash available for distribution to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at year-end 2020. As a reminder, our expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. NextEra Energy Partners is also considering several potential refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. If pursued, these initiatives could generate costs in the fourth quarter, before translating to favorable cash available for distribution contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our unitholders. From a base of NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable on February 2021, to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 2020 distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70% highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextEra Energy Partners has going forward. as we previously discussed, while we continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 favorable position should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives, without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. We are pleased with a strong year-to-date performance in NextEra Energy Partners and continue to believe it offers a compelling investor value proposition going forward. with significant expected long-term renewables growth combined with the strength of NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio and continued access to low-cost sources of capital, we believe NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry. NextEra Energy Partners continues to maintain flexibility to grow in three ways; through our great organic growth, third-party acquisitions or through acquisition from NextEra Energy resources, unparalleled portfolio of renewables projects that now totals roughly 28 gigawatts, including signed backlog. These factors provide us with as much confidence in NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 long-term future as we have ever had. We look forward to delivering on that potential in the coming years. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hello. Thank you. I guess, two questions; first of all, the \u2013 does the backlog increase that you announced today include the NiSource NIPSCO projects that were just announced this morning or would those be additive?\nJohn Ketchum: Steve, this is John Ketchum. Yes, it does include the NiSource projects.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then second question would just be this will probably be the last time we hear from you before the election results. So just maybe, one more time. Could you just talk about in the event that Biden wins the election, thoughts on what that could mean for renewables opportunity? And also thoughts on how NextEra is positioned for any tax reform changes. Thanks.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve. As you well know and kind of consistent with our history, we focus on analyzing a variety of impacts and one of our key focus for going into the election is to ensure that we\u2019re well positioned to be successful regardless of the outcome. And looking back in the last couple of years, obviously, we\u2019ve done quite well across all of our businesses in the environment that we\u2019ve been in. So, should Trump win a second term, we would expect to continue our strong momentum and continued focus on our strategies and execution on them. If Biden is the new President, he has clearly made clear across this platform, across the Democratic platform that they had strong support for renewables. To date, their plan is more focused on broad goals as opposed to specific plans for how they would get there, but we could easily see, whether it\u2019s extension of incentives, focus on storage, potentially focus on hydrogen, et cetera, to further accelerate the expansion of renewables across the U.S. beyond the already strong demand that we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s clearly based on the economic value of renewables relative to the alternatives. As it relates to tax reform, obviously, that\u2019s part of some of the things that Biden has been talking about. It certainly could be on the agenda. I think there\u2019s a question as to whether or not it would be one of the first things that a new administration would want to focus on, particularly as we will likely find ourselves still in recovery mode from the pandemic and we will evaluate, as there\u2019s \u2013 if there are more details and as there are more details, we\u2019ll evaluate the overall impacts. If you look at the prior tax reform as an example, clearly, a change in the tax rate, an increase in the tax rate, as Biden has talked about, would have some negative adjusted earnings impacts, positive cash impacts, all else being equal. But we need to think about, one, the details of any policies that they put forward; but two, together with the other things that would come along with the new Biden administration, including the strong demand for renewables that we would expect. So more to come as we learn more and, obviously, the results from the actual election unfold.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning to you. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. If I can follow-up on a couple of things here. First, transmission, you guys did this interesting announcement in the quarter. How does that enable a further expansion of potentially larger-scale projects? And how does that complement essentially larger-scale renewable ambitions you might have across the core Midwest territories that they serve today?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, Julien. thanks for the question. We are thrilled with the acquisition, of course, subject to approvals of GridLiance, and it is the three different transmission companies across six states, where their existing assets are located. First, there are investment opportunities in those existing investments that we have \u2013 that we would have in GridLiance. But it also positions us to have a seat at the table in these regional ISOs as they contemplate new transmission projects. And obviously, GridLiance would seek to compete effectively for those opportunities. The comment around renewables is that as we think about a broad and substantial expansion of renewables across the U.S., it becomes important and increasingly so over time, to continue to invest in the transmission grid across the U.S. So, we want to be a part of that solution and capitalize on those investment opportunities via our competitive transmission business, but also, we\u2019ll depend on that in order to realize the significant expansion of renewables over time. So, it\u2019s both an enabler and an investment opportunity from our perspective.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. Perhaps, if I can pivot over to the more strategic side of the equation here and perhaps I\u2019ll frame it this way. So, you all have recently received greater latitude when it comes to your debt metrics on an FFO to debt basis from the agencies. Can you talk about how you might receive yet further latitude as you think about the percent regulated the business needs to get to, to unlock yet for lower metrics, if that makes sense? And perhaps in tandem with that, might you espouse your latest thought process on strategic thinking from here beyond, perhaps some of the comments you previously provided to the extent relevant.\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, of course. So, a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us. And one of the things that we spend a lot of time talking with the agencies about is how strong a cash flow generation profile all of the businesses have, how diverse in a variety of metrics, including geography, technology, customers, et cetera, and how that profile compares very favorably to other peers in the industry and their own respective cash profiles. So, we did realize the improvement in downgrade thresholds, specifically at Moody\u2019s this period that 18% to 17% downgrade threshold improvement and we\u2019ll continue discussing with the agencies about the high-quality characteristics of our cash flows and seek improvements in additional flexibility as appropriate. There is the opportunity to have extensive dialogues with the agencies around potential regulated M&A. So any time, we do contemplate transactions we have those conversations to evaluate whether or not the profile of the cash flow generation changes such that it would move those metrics. And as we have those dialogues and have those conversations with respect to potential M&A, we factor those in to any deal transaction economics. It remains incredibly important to us to be able to maintain consistency with our objectives around M&A, which is that they\u2019re value accretive from an earnings perspective. They also are in strong regulatory environments and create opportunities for us to invest capital. But being accretive is incredibly important to us. As you know, when we think about metrics, there are quite a number of ways to think about the balance of our business between the competitive generation business and regulated. And one of the key ways that we continue to maintain that balance is through capital recycling. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why NextEra Energy finds value in its long-term relationship with NextEra Energy Partners, is the clear ability to recycle capital in a very efficient way with NextEra Energy Partners.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But there\u2019s no specific percent regulated that you want to achieve to get that number down to 16% or 15%, right?\nRebecca Kujawa: No. We\u2019re not prescriptive about a specific balance. We think about a variety of factors when we think about what\u2019s the optimal balance of our business and there\u2019s not one answer at a given point in time. And certainly, that can be influenced over time as things change and our perspective and the agency\u2019s perspective changes.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you, all. Best of luck.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hi, good morning, guys.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Just a quick follow-up on Julien\u2019s question. And it\u2019s really bent on sort of that mix. Obviously, FPL and Gulf are posting very solid regulatory capital deployment, but the NEER development platform keeps signing contracts. And as you guys sort of highlighted that the backlog is now larger than the existing portfolio. So, curious on how we should sort of think about the growth trajectory of NEER as we\u2019re sort of thinking about a mix. I mean, is 70%/30%, Rebecca, no longer relevant on what you sort of target there? Have you sort of sanitized the additional growth opportunities with NEER with the rating agencies? And then how do you sort of stay within a potential mix? Obviously, recycling capital into NEP is an option, but that has a lot of constraints and limits. Slowing down NEER likely isn\u2019t an option. So really is the path of least resistance, more regulated acquisitions. So maybe, if you could just drill down a little bit further into the prior question?\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Shar. And then I certainly appreciate the premise of the question, which is, we have terrific organic growth prospects at both the regulated utilities and in the competitive energy business. One of the things that we think is really important from the competitive side of the business is so long as we can find projects that are attractive, that have attractive returns. We don\u2019t want our teams to be capital constrained because we believe that these are very strong value-accretive project investment opportunities for our shareholders. So, we set them off and hope that they can find all of the best projects and that we can secure the wins and build those projects. As you know, a significant amount of the value creation of developing renewables projects and owning and operating them long-term is in that development process, constructing them and beginning and putting them into operations. So, if we can continue to do that with value-accretive projects, and to the extent that we want to manage a balance of the mix of business across the different companies. We will take advantage of that capital recycling as one of the best ways and most value-accretive ways for NextEra Energy shareholders to recycle capital either to NextEra Energy Partners or potentially even to other third parties depending on market characteristics at the time. So, I think we\u2019ve got a lot of levers. And again, most importantly, in a terrific position of win-win of having a lot of places to place our capital and, obviously, we\u2019re pleased with raising our capital investment ranges for the four-year period.\nShar Pourreza: So just a follow-up. So that 70%/30% regulated non-utility mix, should we sort of just move away from that sort of target that we\u2019ve discussed in the past?\nRebecca Kujawa: Shar, I think the key takeaway is there\u2019s not a specific number that is the right number. And we\u2019ll be \u2013 we think about it in a variety of different ways over time. And there are a variety of levers that we can utilize to maintain a balance, but we\u2019re not prescriptive on a specific number that it needs to be.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And then just on the battery side, you obviously added 594 megawatts, which includes a single 325, four-hour project. Can you sort of just maybe talk about the economics of storage you\u2019re seeing, especially with the four hours project? Just maybe from an LCOE perspective, and with the current backlog of storage opportunities, is four hours of storage sort of that peak capability? Or are you seeing some longer storage opportunities?\nRebecca Kujawa: Well, let me take that last part first. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a constraint or a peak capability of storage. There are clearly a variety of storage solutions that could make sense in a given application. What our energy resources team is largely focused on is providing solutions that our customers want to buy, that solve our customers\u2019 needs. And most recently, four-hour storage has been very attractive and particularly interesting to our customers. So, we have sold quite a number of four-hour storage projects. From a return standpoint, these storage facilities are often sold together with other renewables projects, specifically other solar projects, and we found the returns to be very attractive, comparable to solar and wind project returns on an overall basis.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. And Shar, this is John Ketchum. I have a couple of things that I would add to that are: One, remember, there are three ways that we really look to grow the storage business. One is pairing it with solar. The second are trifecta opportunities that we\u2019ve advertised in the past that we\u2019ve been successful executing on, combining storage with wind and with solar. If we were able to get \u2013 ever to get a stand-alone storage ITC, obviously, that would help what is the largest wind portfolio in North America. And then the stand-alone opportunities along the lines of what we\u2019re able to advertise today. So, when you combine those three potential opportunity sets, we have a significant growth opportunity in storage. You see that in our 2021 CapEx plan, that is over $1 billion in storage. Nobody has the existing fleet that we have. And so the opportunity to pair storage at existing solar facilities, existing wind facilities and then look for stand-alone opportunities, I think, puts us in a different class, just based on the existing operating fleet that we have. And then as you think about batteries going forward, four-hour duration may make sense in certain markets, two hours in others. But in two to three years, we could be moving to solid-state batteries, which could also provide longer duration, more efficient at a reduced cost. And then hydrogen certainly is a long-term alternative. We mentioned the 50 pilot projects today in electricity, in transportation and industrial applications. So, we see hydrogen as really a long-term solution, particularly if we end up in 100% decarbonized energy policy by 2035, where hydrogen could really be the solution for that last 10% to 15% where it gets very expensive to do with batteries, much cheaper and more manageable to do with hydrogen.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific guys. Thank you very much.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. On the renewable front, it seems that after years of not really doing a lot, that pretty much every regulated investor-owned utility has its own renewable growth strategy and rate base. Can you talk about \u2013 now the broader market has massive tailwinds? But can you talk about how that move by the regulated IOUs is impacting the competitive dynamic for people developing, especially all given your scale, renewables on the non-regulated side of the business. Like how does that just kind of flow-through or impact the market dynamic?\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Michael. We appreciate the question. Well, let me highlight first and at the risk of sounding a little too flip. We now have a backlog of over 15,000 gigawatts, and we do get a lot of questions about whether or not we\u2019re concerned about the competitive dynamic, but the team is doing pretty well in this dynamic. And keep in mind that we\u2019ve got customer base that\u2019s investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops and C&I customers. And the dynamics of wanting to build and rate base really are predominantly focused on the investor-owned utility side. And there are opportunities even within investor-owned utilities to compete effectively for the business and partner with them in many cases to create win-win opportunities for them to get the best built projects for their customers, own some of it in rate base, enable us to operate it in some cases, enable us to power purchase agreement \u2013 enter into those power purchase agreements and sell it to them over time. And then, of course, we continue to have strong opportunities to sell under contract to the munis and co-ops and C&I customers. So the outlook is very bright. Our team is doing a terrific job executing, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to deliver against those growth opportunities.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. And just, Michael, picking up on a couple of the comments that Rebecca made. With IOUs, let\u2019s just take a look at what happened with NIPSCO this quarter. If you add on the 400 megawatts of wind that we announced last year, we\u2019re now at 2-gigawatts with just one customer, one investor-owned utility in Indiana, in NIPSCO. So, we still see significant opportunities for investor-owned utility renewable buildout, being able to bring low-cost solutions that combine not only traditional renewables, but with storage applications and then obviously around hydrogen. Munis and co-ops have always been a core part of the business. And then C&I, as Rebecca mentioned at the end, the C&I market is really accelerating. And as ESG has really come into the fold, a lot of the investor pressure that formally nontraditional buyers of renewables are facing from their investor base has really expanded the opportunity set for us to sell many different products to those potential customers. And one of the things that we\u2019re seeing in the decarbonized U.S. economy is not only the chance to sell renewables, but also to play to our others ranks. So a lot of adjacencies, a lot of adjacencies around clean energy, where we are the natural fit to be a leader in some of those specific markets. And those are some of the things that we are continuing to look at and spending a lot of time as a senior team focusing on.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And if you don\u2019t mind a follow-up on the regulated side. In the event sometime over the next couple of years, there are higher corporate income tax rates and we\u2019ll see, obviously, policy changes and is fluid. How do you think about what that means for the customer, given the cost of service would obviously have to reflect the higher tax rate? But also the excess accumulated deferred federal income taxes that currently is being refunded by many utilities around the country, part of that would actually potentially, I think, reverse. So it would kind of put on the backs of the customer a decent bit of a rate increase and a little vary by jurisdiction and by utility. How does that impact the dynamic over a multiyear period? Yes, it raises cash flow, but it could also raise the customer bill. And what do you think the opportunity set is for NextEra in terms of either offsetting that impact? Or even improving your competitive position at the utility level relative to some of your peers?\nJim Robo: Hey Michael it\u2019s Jim. Let me take that because we\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking around, obviously, different scenarios around, obviously, different scenarios around what happens with taxes depending on what happens with the federal elections. Remember, what happened in 2017 around tax reform is that the industry very effectively, I think, came together, and they were really two industries that were carved out for different treatment in the 2017 tax reform scenario. One was real estate, and I\u2019ll let you speculate as to why real estate might have gotten singled out. And the other was the utility sector and the utility sector, I think, was very effective in laying out what the impacts to customers and to balance sheets were around tax reform. I think to the extent that there is any tax discussion next year. Let\u2019s assume for a minute that Biden wins, I think it\u2019s very \u2013 I think it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re obviously in a scenario planning around both outcomes because I think you can\u2019t really handicap it one way or another right now. The best thinking that we\u2019ve had around this is that in the middle of a pandemic it\u2019s probably not the time to have a tax increase period. And so in terms of the timing around tax reform, I\u2019d be surprised if it was next year, honestly, even in a Biden administration. Who knows, right? I mean that\u2019s a bit of speculation on my part. But the other thing I think we would be very effective as an industry being able to do is to lay out how any tax increase on utilities is really simply a tax increase on all customers and non- corporations but on everyday Americans. And I think that message will resonate in Washington. And so that\u2019s a message that we, as an industry, haven\u2019t been able to lay out yet, obviously, because it\u2019s premature to do so. So I think a lot of the angst around tax reform, one way or another, is I think a little premature right now. And obviously, we\u2019ll see what happens in the election. But then if Biden does win, then there\u2019s going to be, where does it stand up in the list of policy priorities for the newer administration if there should be one.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Jim. Much appreciated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi, guys. A couple of questions on the possibility of higher taxes on the other side of it, wondering if that would potentially reduce your need to use tax equity for projects going forward. And also, I understand as the largest player out there, you guys don\u2019t really ever have a problem attracting tax equity investors. But can you just comment on the status of the tax equity market in general right now? I guess, it\u2019s pretty tight for some of the smaller players. Is that something that could improve under a Democratic administration if the tax rates go up and tax credits are extended, et cetera?\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. Let me start with this year first. From a tax equity market standpoint, that was one of the things that we and everybody else in the industry, and of course, the tax equity providers were thinking about in the early stages of the pandemic. We have secured all of our tax equity commitments for this year and have already started the dialogues with tax equity partners about our pipeline of projects for next year. And we feel confident about our ability to secure tax equity. I do think as you go out a year into 2021 and maybe into 2022, it\u2019s certainly possible that the tax equity providers are going to have more limited capacity. And that may affect others further down the chain a little bit smaller or a lot smaller than we are and could be an issue. As it relates to tax reform, it\u2019s \u2013 without knowing the details of it and the kind of having more of the specifics, it\u2019s hard to answer the question of whether or not the needle has moved enough to not need tax equity. It also somewhat presumes that there\u2019s an extension of incentives because, obviously, if the incentives phase out like they are currently expected to, there\u2019s a less need for tax equity over time. And that\u2019s actually one of the things that we\u2019ve highlighted in terms of our future power purchase agreement prices, is optimization around financing, so seeking lower cost source of financing other than tax equity would be a positive. So I think there\u2019s pluses and minuses, puts and takes. What I do feel very comfortable with is the outlook and demand for renewables is really strong, and we\u2019ve continued to realize attractive returns, and we\u2019re excited about keeping \u2013 continuing to capitalize on these opportunities.\nMichael Weinstein: Great. Great. And also on the wind repowerings, is there \u2013 what\u2019s the primary consideration that you\u2019re looking at to increase those numbers as you look at 2021, 2022 and beyond?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes. I think the key focus there is really the economics of the repowering projects and ensuring that they are attractive returns and meet the requirements from a tax perspective and, obviously, are also something that our customers are interested in. So, we\u2019ve continued those dialogues over time. And as we\u2019ve gotten closer to the time frames in which we would do these repowerings, obviously, the rubber starts to hit the road, and we\u2019ve been able to start to secure some of those and have increased visibility to those incremental investment opportunities, obviously, in that range that we discussed today.\nMichael Weinstein: Right. Would an extension of tax credits really allow you to really increase that or increase the opportunities anyway?\nRebecca Kujawa: It\u2019s certainly possible that it could. Again, a little bit subject to the details of what an extension of incentives looks like, and all the other factors that go into whether or not a project is attractive, but absolutely.\nMichael Weinstein: One last question. On FERC 2222, it improves the ability of residential solar to sell into grid services. And I\u2019m just wondering, if the value \u2013 that value that comes from FERC 2222 makes \u2013changes your mind at all about residential solar, is it possible investment opportunity for next year?\nRebecca Kujawa: We\u2019ve looked at distributed generation investments. Obviously, we have a very strong business on the \u2013 more of the commercial and industrial side. We\u2019ve looked at residential over time. But one of the key factors for us is that we\u2019re a significant sized company, and we like to deploy a significant amount of capital, and inevitably, these are much smaller investment opportunities. But we do look at the business over a long period of time. And obviously, we\u2019ll enter it where we think it makes sense. But we\u2019re really focused on kind of a little bit larger scale investment opportunities for the most part.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Steve, this is John Ketchum. Yes, it does include the NiSource projects. Yes. And Shar, this is John Ketchum. I have a couple of things that I would add to that are: One, remember, there are three ways that we really look to grow the storage business. One is pairing it with solar. The second are trifecta opportunities that we've advertised in the past that we've been successful executing on, combining storage with wind and with solar. If we were able to get \u2013 ever to get a stand-alone storage ITC, obviously, that would help what is the largest wind portfolio in North America. And then the stand-alone opportunities along the lines of what we're able to advertise today. So, when you combine those three potential opportunity sets, we have a significant growth opportunity in storage. You see that in our 2021 CapEx plan, that is over $1 billion in storage. Nobody has the existing fleet that we have. And so the opportunity to pair storage at existing solar facilities, existing wind facilities and then look for stand-alone opportunities, I think, puts us in a different class, just based on the existing operating fleet that we have.

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and continue to perform well on managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. NextEra Energy's third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior-year comparable quarter, reflecting strong execution at Florida Power & Light Company, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Year-to-date, we have grown adjusted earnings per share by over 10% relative to 2019. We continue to execute well on our major initiatives, including continuing to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history and we are well positioned to meet our overall objectives for 2020 and beyond. Before moving on, I would like to say a few words about hurricanes Isaias, Laura, Sally and Delta. As you know, residents throughout the eastern and southeastern U.S. were recently impacted by the severe effects of these dangerous and deadly storms. Our deepest sympathies are with those, who have been impacted by these storms widespread destruction. We are grateful for the support that others have given us over the years and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent several thousand of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. Gulf Power itself was impacted by Hurricane Sally, which experienced an unexpected change in intensity and path before striking the service area. Approximately, 285,000 customers or more than 60% of Gulf Power's customers experienced outages as Sally brought heavy rain and severe flooding. Through a restoration workforce that totaled approximately 7,000 workers, including approximately 2,000 FPL employees and contractors. Gulf Power was able to restore service to essentially all impacted customers within five days. We are pleased with the efficient and safe restoration response to Hurricane Sally, which was made more challenging by the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our focus on preparation and execution, including our annual storm drills helped ensure a timely response to the hurricane despite the pandemic. At Florida Power & Light earnings per share increased $0.14 year-over-year. All of the major capital projects including one of the largest solar expansions ever in the U.S. remain on track as we continue to advance our long-term focus on delivering outstanding customer value. FPL's typical residential bill remains 30% below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities. All while FPL maintains best-in-class service reliability and an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. As part of our continued focus on doing what is right for our customers, last month, FPL announced that among other measures, it was offering direct relief of up to $200 per customer to those that are experiencing hardship and are significantly behind on their bills due to COVID-19. We remain committed to supporting our customers during this challenging time. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution as we continue to deliver on the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we have previously outlined. We remained focused on improving the Gulf Power customer value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions, and continue to expect that this strategy will generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by roughly 23% year-over-year, building upon the success of recent quarters, our development team had the best quarter of origination in Energy Resources' history, adding nearly 2,200 megawatts of signed contracts to our renewables backlog. After accounting for the removal of several projects, which I'll talk about more in a moment, our backlog increased by approximately 1,450 megawatts, and now totaled more than 15,000 megawatts. To put this into perspective, our backlog, which we continue to expect and expect to construct over the next several years is now larger than Energy Resources entire existing renewables portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute, commissioning more than 800 megawatts since the last earnings call and keeping the remainder of the \u2013 more than 5,200 total megawatts of wind and solar projects that we're expecting to complete this year on track to achieve their 2020 in-service dates. Overall, with three quarters complete in 2020, we are pleased with the progress we are making in NextEra Energy and are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our normal caveats. Now, let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. With the third quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $757 million or $1.54 per share, an increase of $74 million and $0.14 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of roughly 11%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.3 billion during the third quarter and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, which as a reminder, is higher than our expectations at the start of the year. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending September 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we restored $258 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $994 million. As we've previously discussed, we expect FPL and Gulf Power operating as a single larger Florida utility company will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. Earlier this month, we were pleased to receive for \u2013 approval for an internal reorganization, whereby Gulf will merge into FPL in January of 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate operating division during 2021 serving its customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies will file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January of 2022. Turning to our development efforts. all of our major capital initiatives at FPL are progressing well. The next six SolarTogether projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,600 megawatts community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. This significant solar expansion combined with low-cost battery storage solutions such as Manatee Energy Storage Center that remains on track to be complete next year represent the next phase of FPL's generation modernization efforts. Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remain on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its commercial \u2013 projected commercial operations date in 2022. During the quarter, we are pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's Storm Protection Plan settlement agreement that allows for clause recovery of storm hardening investments, including undergrounding. The agreement supports the continued hardening of FPL's already storm-resilient energy grid in a programmatic manner through the deployment of billions of dollars of incremental capital for the benefit of customers. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $91 million or $0.18 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share relative to Gulf Power's adjusted earnings per share in the prior-year period. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.5% for the 12 months ending September 2020. For the full-year 2020, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were roughly $350 million and we expect our full-year capital investments to total between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf Power's major smart capital investments continue to progress well. The Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion and associated natural gas laterals are expected to be complete later this year, supporting NextEra Energy's coal phase-out strategy and commitment to remain a clean energy leader. Although Gulf Power has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of the Hurricane Sally recoverable storm restoration costs is roughly $200 million. The storm restoration costs have been deferred and recorded as a regulatory asset on Gulf Power's balance sheet. Under the terms of Gulf Power's current rate agreement, beginning 60 days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the Florida Public Service Commission and subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm costs, Gulf Power is authorized to recover storm restoration costs on an interim basis from customers through a surcharge. Similar to FPL, Gulf Power's Storm Protection Plan settlement agreement was also approved during the quarter. We expect that these future hardening investments will lead to a stronger and more storm-resilient grid at Gulf Power and support an even more rapid recovery from storms in the future. Similar to other parts in the country, the Florida economy continues to recover from the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects an improvement in the Florida unemployment rate since the start of the pandemic and an increase in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes to the national averages of each metric. We continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound as we move beyond the pandemic. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was particularly strong, increasing by nearly $80,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 2.8% year-over-year as customer growth, weather and underlying usage per customer all contributed favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales declined 6.7% year-over-year, primarily as a result of unfavorable weather comparison relative to the particularly strong third quarter last year and a decline in underlying usage, primarily associated with Hurricane Sally. At both FPL and Gulf Power, third quarter weather-normalized retail sales were roughly in line with our expectations at the start of the year, and we do not believe that the pandemic had much of an overall impact on underlying usage. At FPL, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism will offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support a regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $376 million or $0.76 per share and adjusted earnings of $551 million or $1.12 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 or approximately 23% from last year's comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy Transmission business, formerly reported in corporate and other. New investments attributed $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables program. The contribution from existing generation assets was flat year-over-year as the decline in wind resource and costs associated with the retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility were roughly offset by increased PTC volume from our repowered wind projects as well as the lack of an unfavorable state tax item, which impacted last year's third quarter results. Contributions from both NextEra Transmission and our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.01 year-over-year. All other impacts increased results by $0.13 per share, driven primarily by the absence of the write-off of development costs, the negatively impacted 2019 results. The Energy Resources development team continued to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the quarter, with the team originating a record of nearly 2,200 megawatts. Since our last earnings call we have added 580 megawatts of new wind, 911 megawatts of solar, 594 megawatts of battery storage and 86 megawatts of wind repowering. The significant additions include a new 325 megawatts four-hour battery storage system. This project which is the largest standalone storage project in the world is expected to support California's aggressive clean energy goals and help improve reliability across the regional electric grid when it comes online in 2023. We also executed 180 megawatts solar build-own-transfer agreement during the quarter, which is not included in our backlog additions. Partially offsetting this quarter's strong origination success was the removal of several projects we had previously included in our backlog. A majority of the reductions are the result of an unfavorable ruling from the Alabama Public Service Commission related to several solar plus storage projects. We expect the customer to hold a future procurement for this generation capacity, and are hopeful that the projects may receive new contracts during that process. After accounting for these projects, removals the Energy Resources backlog had a net increase of 1,446 megawatts during the quarter. Reflective of our customer demand for low-cost wind, solar and battery storage projects that is stronger than ever. The repowering projects added this quarter include our first project for beyond 2020, and adds to the recent significant increase to our 2021 new wind and repowering backlog, which now totals roughly 2,000 megawatts. With the addition of the 2021 repowering project we are now introducing repowering expectations for 2021 and 2022 period of 200 megawatts to 700 megawatts. Continued cost and technology improvements have supported an expanding opportunity set for both new wind and repowering over time. As a result, we are beginning to evaluate incremental repowering opportunities for beyond 2022. Through the first three quarters of 2020 we have added nearly 4,800 megawatts to our renewables backlog, which now totals more than 15,000 megawatts and is the largest in our history. To reflect the current backlog and strong origination success we are raising the low end of our 2019 through 2022 development expectations to 15,500 megawatts, which is above the midpoint of our original range. And we are increasing the top end of the expectations to reflect the incremental repowering expectations that we added this quarter. Additionally, with more than 4,000 megawatts of renewables projects already in our backlog for post 2022 we are well positioned to execute on our long-term growth objectives. We continue to believe that by leveraging Energy Resources' competitive advantages, we can further capitalize on the best renewables development environment in our history going forward. As we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the potential for green hydrogen to support an emissions-free future. Consistent with our toe in the water approach to new opportunities Energy Resources has developed a pipeline of approximately 50 potential green hydrogen projects spanning the power, transportation and industrial sectors. These projects serve a variety of end uses, and similar to the strategy employed in wind, solar, battery storage and other areas, provide the opportunity to develop early learnings with relatively small investments to set the stage for much larger capital deployment as cost declines and technology improvements are realized. Over the next several quarters we expect to add to this pipeline, while advancing select projects as we position ourselves to continue to be a leader in the decarbonization of the energy sector. We remain excited about hydrogen's long-term potential to further support future demand for low-cost renewables, as well as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks. Beyond renewables, we are pleased with the recent progress to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for Mountain Valley Pipeline's construction. Among other progress since the last earnings call, MVP has received its revised biological opinion, approval of the project's nationwide 12 permit by the Army Corps of Engineers and a recent order by FERC authorizing forward construction to resume along the majority of the project route. Following receipt of this approval, MVP resumed construction work across West Virginia and Virginia. Despite the recent progress we were disappointed with the Fourth Circuit Court's decisions to administratively stay MVP's nationwide 12 permit. We disagree with the court's decision and continue to work with our partners to move the project forward. Depending on the outcome of these issues, we continue to target an in-service date of the pipeline for during 2021. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate-regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter NextEra Energy Transmission announced an agreement to acquire Grid Lines, which owns three FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning six states. Subject to regulatory approvals, the approximately $660 million acquisition, including the assumption of debt is expected to close in 2021, and to be immediately accretive to earnings. The proposed acquisition has strong expansion potential and attractive markets with significant expected renewables growth, and furthers our goal of growing America's leading competitive transmission company. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2020 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.229 billion or $2.50 share. NextEra Energy's 2020 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.311 billion and $2.66 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment declined $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to other corporate expenses, which includes interest. During the quarter NextEra Energy issued $2 billion of equity units as we continue to focus on opportunistic and prudent capital management to enhance the strength of our balance sheet. The equity units will convert to common equity in 2023. And the proceeds are expected to be primarily used to redeem a portion of NextEra Energy's outstanding hybrid securities and to finance the acquisition of GridLiance and NextEra Energy's continued renewables expansion. In addition to the redemption of hybrid securities in the fourth quarter, we are also considering several other potential refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. In total, these initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of roughly $0.20 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Consistent with our efforts to position NextEra Energy well for long-term growth and take advantage of the low interest rate environment, during the quarter, we entered into $2 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps to further support future debt issuances. Finally, in July, as part of its 2020 annual review, Moody's reduced NextEra Energy's CFO pre-working capital-to-debt downgrade threshold from 18% to 17%. The favorable adjustment was based on recognition of NextEra Energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors and stable cash flow generation profile. As we announced last month, based on the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and continued execution across all of our businesses, we increased NextEra Energy's financial expectations for 2021 and 2022, and extended our long-term growth outlook to 2023. For 2021, NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS expectation ranges increased by $0.20, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $9.60 to $10.15. For 2022 and 2023, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected increased 2021 adjusted earnings per share. The increased adjusted earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry, largely as a result of the significant renewables investment opportunities that we expect to capitalize on, we now expect our total capital expenditures from 2019 to 2022, to total roughly $60 billion, an increase from the $50 billion to $55 billion range we introduced at the Investor Conference last year. During the quarter, the Board of NextEra Energy approved a four-for-one common stock split, which is intended to make stock ownership more accessible to a broader base of investors. Trading will begin on a stock split adjusted basis on October 27. And our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results will reflect the post split share count. As a result of the stock split NextEra Energy updated its adjusted EPS ranges to reflect the increase in its \u2013 in outstanding shares. In 2020, the company now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.30. The adjusted EPS ranges for 2021 and beyond are included on the accompanying slide. from 2018 to 2023, we expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of the 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, despite the challenges created by COVID-19 pandemic, NextEra Energy has continued to deliver terrific operational and financial results through the first three quarters of 2020. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and our strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in 2020, 2021, 2022 and now 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution, and believe NextEra Energy remains well positioned to drive shareholder value in the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. The NextEra Energy Partners portfolio performed well and delivered financial results in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was down slightly compared to the third quarter of 2019 and cash available for distribution increased 10% versus the prior year comparable quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 16% and 50% respectively, versus 2019. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.595 per common unit, or $2.38 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. During September, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt into roughly 5.7 million common units. This financing, combined with a related capped call, that NextEra Energy Partners entered into at the time of the debt issuance, generated significant value for LP unitholders. Following receipt of the capped call settlement, the debt had roughly $0 three-year cumulative cash cost. Relative to issuing equity at the time of the financing, 25% fewer units were issued. And NextEra Energy Partners generated approximately $50 million in cumulative cash savings. The convertible debt financing highlights the value of NextEra Energy Partners, utilizing low-cost financing products to support growth and efficiently issue equity over time. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and are well positioned to meet our 2020 and longer-term expectations. Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $312 million, a decline of approximately 1% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $162 million, up approximately 10% from the prior-year comparable quarter. new projects added $24 million of adjusted EBITDA and $16 million of cash available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA from the existing assets declined year-over-year as lower wind resource was partially offset by growth at the Texas pipelines as a result of the expansion project going into service. Wind resource was 96% of long-term average versus a particularly strong 107% in the third quarter of 2019. cash available for distribution from existing projects benefited from a reduction in debt service payments, primarily as a result of the retirement of outstanding notes at our Genesis project and receipt of higher year-over-year PAYGO payments. The reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. The additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. We are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed its first two organic growth investments ahead of schedule and on budget. The repowering of the 175 megawatt Northern Colorado wind project was recently placed into service. The repowering provides multiple benefits to NextEra Energy Partners, including increased production, an uplift in project cash flow, a longer asset life and lower O&M costs. The remaining 100 megawatts of wind repowering, remains on track to be in service later this year. Additionally, during the quarter, the backup compression capacity on the Texas pipelines also reached commercial operation. The expansion opportunity is supported by a long-term contract and is expected to deliver attractive returns to LP unitholders. The ability to complete these projects as planned, despite the challenges created by the pandemic is a testament to the best-in-class engineering and construction team that NextEra Energy partners is able to leverage to execute its organic investments. We continue to expect to execute on additional attractive organic growth opportunities as the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio further expands. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners' expectations, which remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, and cash available for distribution to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at year-end 2020. As a reminder, our expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. NextEra Energy Partners is also considering several potential refinancing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. If pursued, these initiatives could generate costs in the fourth quarter, before translating to favorable cash available for distribution contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our unitholders. From a base of NextEra Energy Partners' fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% per year growth in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable on February 2021, to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners' 2020 distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70% highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextEra Energy Partners has going forward. as we previously discussed, while we continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners' favorable position should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives, without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. We are pleased with a strong year-to-date performance in NextEra Energy Partners and continue to believe it offers a compelling investor value proposition going forward. with significant expected long-term renewables growth combined with the strength of NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio and continued access to low-cost sources of capital, we believe NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry. NextEra Energy Partners continues to maintain flexibility to grow in three ways; through our great organic growth, third-party acquisitions or through acquisition from NextEra Energy resources, unparalleled portfolio of renewables projects that now totals roughly 28 gigawatts, including signed backlog. These factors provide us with as much confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long-term future as we have ever had. We look forward to delivering on that potential in the coming years. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Thanks, Steve. As you well know and kind of consistent with our history, we focus on analyzing a variety of impacts and one of our key focus for going into the election is to ensure that we're well positioned to be successful regardless of the outcome. And looking back in the last couple of years, obviously, we've done quite well across all of our businesses in the environment that we've been in. So, should Trump win a second term, we would expect to continue our strong momentum and continued focus on our strategies and execution on them. If Biden is the new President, he has clearly made clear across this platform, across the Democratic platform that they had strong support for renewables. To date, their plan is more focused on broad goals as opposed to specific plans for how they would get there, but we could easily see, whether it's extension of incentives, focus on storage, potentially focus on hydrogen, et cetera, to further accelerate the expansion of renewables across the U.S. beyond the already strong demand that we're seeing, that's clearly based on the economic value of renewables relative to the alternatives. As it relates to tax reform, obviously, that's part of some of the things that Biden has been talking about. It certainly could be on the agenda. I think there's a question as to whether or not it would be one of the first things that a new administration would want to focus on, particularly as we will likely find ourselves still in recovery mode from the pandemic and we will evaluate, as there's \u2013 if there are more details and as there are more details, we'll evaluate the overall impacts. If you look at the prior tax reform as an example, clearly, a change in the tax rate, an increase in the tax rate, as Biden has talked about, would have some negative adjusted earnings impacts, positive cash impacts, all else being equal. But we need to think about, one, the details of any policies that they put forward; but two, together with the other things that would come along with the new Biden administration, including the strong demand for renewables that we would expect. So more to come as we learn more and, obviously, the results from the actual election unfold. Thanks, Steve. Yes, Julien. thanks for the question. We are thrilled with the acquisition, of course, subject to approvals of GridLiance, and it is the three different transmission companies across six states, where their existing assets are located. First, there are investment opportunities in those existing investments that we have \u2013 that we would have in GridLiance. But it also positions us to have a seat at the table in these regional ISOs as they contemplate new transmission projects. And obviously, GridLiance would seek to compete effectively for those opportunities. The comment around renewables is that as we think about a broad and substantial expansion of renewables across the U.S., it becomes important and increasingly so over time, to continue to invest in the transmission grid across the U.S. So, we want to be a part of that solution and capitalize on those investment opportunities via our competitive transmission business, but also, we'll depend on that in order to realize the significant expansion of renewables over time. So, it's both an enabler and an investment opportunity from our perspective. Yes, of course. So, a strong balance sheet is incredibly important to us. And one of the things that we spend a lot of time talking with the agencies about is how strong a cash flow generation profile all of the businesses have, how diverse in a variety of metrics, including geography, technology, customers, et cetera, and how that profile compares very favorably to other peers in the industry and their own respective cash profiles. So, we did realize the improvement in downgrade thresholds, specifically at Moody's this period that 18% to 17% downgrade threshold improvement and we'll continue discussing with the agencies about the high-quality characteristics of our cash flows and seek improvements in additional flexibility as appropriate. There is the opportunity to have extensive dialogues with the agencies around potential regulated M&A. So any time, we do contemplate transactions we have those conversations to evaluate whether or not the profile of the cash flow generation changes such that it would move those metrics. And as we have those dialogues and have those conversations with respect to potential M&A, we factor those in to any deal transaction economics. It remains incredibly important to us to be able to maintain consistency with our objectives around M&A, which is that they're value accretive from an earnings perspective. They also are in strong regulatory environments and create opportunities for us to invest capital. But being accretive is incredibly important to us. As you know, when we think about metrics, there are quite a number of ways to think about the balance of our business between the competitive generation business and regulated. And one of the key ways that we continue to maintain that balance is through capital recycling. And that's one of the reasons why NextEra Energy finds value in its long-term relationship with NextEra Energy Partners, is the clear ability to recycle capital in a very efficient way with NextEra Energy Partners. No. We're not prescriptive about a specific balance. We think about a variety of factors when we think about what's the optimal balance of our business and there's not one answer at a given point in time. And certainly, that can be influenced over time as things change and our perspective and the agency's perspective changes. Thank, Julien. Good morning. Thanks, Shar. And then I certainly appreciate the premise of the question, which is, we have terrific organic growth prospects at both the regulated utilities and in the competitive energy business. One of the things that we think is really important from the competitive side of the business is so long as we can find projects that are attractive, that have attractive returns. We don't want our teams to be capital constrained because we believe that these are very strong value-accretive project investment opportunities for our shareholders. So, we set them off and hope that they can find all of the best projects and that we can secure the wins and build those projects. As you know, a significant amount of the value creation of developing renewables projects and owning and operating them long-term is in that development process, constructing them and beginning and putting them into operations. So, if we can continue to do that with value-accretive projects, and to the extent that we want to manage a balance of the mix of business across the different companies. We will take advantage of that capital recycling as one of the best ways and most value-accretive ways for NextEra Energy shareholders to recycle capital either to NextEra Energy Partners or potentially even to other third parties depending on market characteristics at the time. So, I think we've got a lot of levers. And again, most importantly, in a terrific position of win-win of having a lot of places to place our capital and, obviously, we're pleased with raising our capital investment ranges for the four-year period. Shar, I think the key takeaway is there's not a specific number that is the right number. And we'll be \u2013 we think about it in a variety of different ways over time. And there are a variety of levers that we can utilize to maintain a balance, but we're not prescriptive on a specific number that it needs to be. Well, let me take that last part first. I don't know that there's a constraint or a peak capability of storage. There are clearly a variety of storage solutions that could make sense in a given application. What our energy resources team is largely focused on is providing solutions that our customers want to buy, that solve our customers' needs. And most recently, four-hour storage has been very attractive and particularly interesting to our customers. So, we have sold quite a number of four-hour storage projects. From a return standpoint, these storage facilities are often sold together with other renewables projects, specifically other solar projects, and we found the returns to be very attractive, comparable to solar and wind project returns on an overall basis. Thank you. Thanks, Michael. We appreciate the question. Well, let me highlight first and at the risk of sounding a little too flip. We now have a backlog of over 15,000 gigawatts, and we do get a lot of questions about whether or not we're concerned about the competitive dynamic, but the team is doing pretty well in this dynamic. And keep in mind that we've got customer base that's investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops and C&I customers. And the dynamics of wanting to build and rate base really are predominantly focused on the investor-owned utility side. And there are opportunities even within investor-owned utilities to compete effectively for the business and partner with them in many cases to create win-win opportunities for them to get the best built projects for their customers, own some of it in rate base, enable us to operate it in some cases, enable us to power purchase agreement \u2013 enter into those power purchase agreements and sell it to them over time. And then, of course, we continue to have strong opportunities to sell under contract to the munis and co-ops and C&I customers. So the outlook is very bright. Our team is doing a terrific job executing, and we're looking forward to continuing to deliver against those growth opportunities. Sure. Let me start with this year first. From a tax equity market standpoint, that was one of the things that we and everybody else in the industry, and of course, the tax equity providers were thinking about in the early stages of the pandemic. We have secured all of our tax equity commitments for this year and have already started the dialogues with tax equity partners about our pipeline of projects for next year. And we feel confident about our ability to secure tax equity. I do think as you go out a year into 2021 and maybe into 2022, it's certainly possible that the tax equity providers are going to have more limited capacity. And that may affect others further down the chain a little bit smaller or a lot smaller than we are and could be an issue. As it relates to tax reform, it's \u2013 without knowing the details of it and the kind of having more of the specifics, it's hard to answer the question of whether or not the needle has moved enough to not need tax equity. It also somewhat presumes that there's an extension of incentives because, obviously, if the incentives phase out like they are currently expected to, there's a less need for tax equity over time. And that's actually one of the things that we've highlighted in terms of our future power purchase agreement prices, is optimization around financing, so seeking lower cost source of financing other than tax equity would be a positive. So I think there's pluses and minuses, puts and takes. What I do feel very comfortable with is the outlook and demand for renewables is really strong, and we've continued to realize attractive returns, and we're excited about keeping \u2013 continuing to capitalize on these opportunities. Yes. I think the key focus there is really the economics of the repowering projects and ensuring that they are attractive returns and meet the requirements from a tax perspective and, obviously, are also something that our customers are interested in. So, we've continued those dialogues over time. And as we've gotten closer to the time frames in which we would do these repowerings, obviously, the rubber starts to hit the road, and we've been able to start to secure some of those and have increased visibility to those incremental investment opportunities, obviously, in that range that we discussed today. It's certainly possible that it could. Again, a little bit subject to the details of what an extension of incentives looks like, and all the other factors that go into whether or not a project is attractive, but absolutely. We've looked at distributed generation investments. Obviously, we have a very strong business on the \u2013 more of the commercial and industrial side. We've looked at residential over time. But one of the key factors for us is that we're a significant sized company, and we like to deploy a significant amount of capital, and inevitably, these are much smaller investment opportunities. But we do look at the business over a long period of time. And obviously, we'll enter it where we think it makes sense. But we're really focused on kind of a little bit larger scale investment opportunities for the most part. Thank you."

NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and continued to perform well both financially and operationally, while managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers, we continue to operate under our pandemic plan that we activated last quarter. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are well-positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.15 year-over-year and its strong execution continues across the board. During the quarter, FPL set a new system peak load of more than 24,500 megawatts. FPL's transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient generating facilities remain available to serve our customers. FPL's continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions. Consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value proposition, last month FPL announced plans to retire share for its last remaining coal unit. Together with our joint interest owner JEA and subject to certain approvals from the Florida Public Service Commission, FPL intends to retire the 847 megawatt coal fired plant in early 2022. The retirement of Scherer 4 is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for FPL customers and prevent roughly four million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit. Scherer 4's retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that FPL launched in 2015 and that will complete the closure of approximately 2,700 megawatts of coal capacity, including the highest greenhouse emitting gas power plants in Florida. These transactions, which will make FPL one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio demonstrate FPL's continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader. We remain proud of our environmental track record, particularly the CO2 emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout Florida and across the country, and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on operational cost effectiveness at Gulf continues to progress well with year-to-date O&M costs, excluding specific COVID-19-related expenses declining by nearly 10% versus the prior year comparable period and by approximately 25% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safely -- safety with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of June. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we've previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. During the quarter, we completed our annual storm drills for FPL and Gulf Power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety. The drill has provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic. While we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year, consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution, we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.13 year-over-year. The Energy Resources team continued to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a testament to the Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages including our best-in-class renewables development skills. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly 650 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately 4,400 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally. While we are monitoring the situation closely, we continue to expect that all of our planned 2020 renewables projects will achieve their in-service dates this year. In response to increased investor focus on environmental, social and governance issues or ESG next week we expect to publish NextEra Energy's updated ESG report, which includes reporting under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB disclosures. Our company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years. NextEra Energy's approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our people, our customers, our communities and the environment are proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time. The new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of ESG includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics. Diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they are the right thing to do, but also because diverse and inclusive teams to deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve. Our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry. However, consistent with our focus on continuous improvement, we are not satisfied and we'll continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in NextEra Energy so far in 2020. Headed into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed, even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic. Now let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $749 million or $1.52 per share, which is an increase of $86 million and $0.15 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 10% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 13%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 billion in the second quarter and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% allowed under our current rate agreement. During the quarter we utilized $7 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $736 million. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 2021. As we've previously discussed, we expect that FPL and Gulf will operate as a single larger Florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. As a result in May, the company has filed an application with FERC for an approval of an internal reorganization, whereby Gulf would merge into FPL. Subject to FERC approval the companies will merge in January of 2021. However, during 2021, Gulf Power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January 2022. Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital initiatives at FPL remain on track and on budget. During the quarter, the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of FPL's base rate settlement agreement were placed into service. The 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective solar constructed under the SoBRA mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the early stages of FPL's rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts. The next six SolarTogether projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts, remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,500 megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 2022. Additionally, the 409 megawatt Manatee storage facility, which will be one of the world's largest battery storage plants, is on track and on budget to be complete next year. Based on our ongoing analysis of the long-term potential of low-cost renewables, we remain confident as ever that wind, solar, and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the energy's existing generation -- the country's existing generation fleet, while reducing cost for customers and helping to achieve future CO2 emissions reductions. However, to achieve an emissions-free future, we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long-term potential of hydrogen. Consistent with the toe in the water approach we've previously utilized with solar and battery storage, we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at FPL. This approximately $65 million pilot project which subject to Florida Public Service Commission approval is expected to be in service in 2023 will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce 100% green hydrogen through a roughly 20 megawatt electrolysis system. The hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We believe that the project is a complement to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights FPL's continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers. We continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses. And while our near-term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program, we are excited about the technology's long-term potential which should further support future demand for low-cost renewables as well as accelerate the de-carbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks. We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class customer value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $55 million or $0.11 per share, a decline of $0.01 per share relative to Gulf Power's adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period. This quarter results include the impact of roughly $5 million of after-tax COVID-19 related expenses, primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic. Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Gulf Power's request to record costs attributable to COVID-19; including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet. As a result, the costs recorded during the second quarter are expected to be reversed during the third quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending June 2020. For the full year 2020, we are targeting a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were roughly $170 million and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf's major smart capital investments including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to progress well. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects an increase in Florida unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes than national averages of each metric. While it is still unclear at this point, how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted, we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately $75,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's second quarter retail sales decreased by 0.8% year-over-year as customer growth and favorable weather were more than offset by a decline in underlying usage per customer. Based on our analysis, the overall effects of the pandemic on underlying usage during the second quarter were relatively muted. FPL benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers and approximately 40% of its load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance. During April, when stay-at-home orders were broadly in effect, FPL's weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately 4% relative to our expectations. As the economy began reopening in early May, weather-normalized retail sales improved and were above our expectations in June. While the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.3% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales declined by roughly 6.2% year-over-year as a result of the under -- of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage per customer. Over the second quarter, Gulf Power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage per customer than FPL, but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in May and June. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs, so any variability would therefore have more impact to Gulf's earnings and ROE than at FPL. As a reminder, as we've often discussed, weather normalization is imprecise particularly when evaluating short periods of time. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today's presentation. Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $481 million or $0.97 per share and adjusted earnings of $531 million or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 or approximately 14% from last year's comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy transmission business formerly reported in Corporate and Other. New investments added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.05 per share as improved wind resource and increased PTC volume from our repower wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility. Second quarter fleet-wide wind resource was 99% of the long-term average versus 93% during the second quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy transmission, where contributions increased by $0.03 versus 2019. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year-over-year. These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined $0.04 versus the particularly strong second quarter last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 per share. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success, adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added 708 megawatts of wind, 844 megawatts of solar and 178 megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog. We also executed a build-owned transfer agreement for a 200 megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog additions. All of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the ITC and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers. The continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives, new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, producing significant long-term renewables demand. Our current backlog now totals approximately 14,400 megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly 20-year development history. To put our backlog into context, it is larger than the current operating wind and solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year-end 2019, highlighting that NextEra Energy continues to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. Only halfway through 2020, we are pleased, we have already signed, nearly 3,500 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2022, which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind, solar and battery storage. To ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years, we now have more than $2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $40 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. These purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we leverage as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position us well for continued long-term growth. The safe harbor equipment also supports additional repowering opportunities, including several hundred megawatts of potential 2021 repowering projects, which we are currently evaluating. As I discussed earlier, all of the 2020 renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in-service dates this year. As a result, we do not expect these projects to rely on the updated treasury start of construction guidance that was released during the quarter. Beyond renewables, we continue to make progress with Mountain Valley Pipeline and work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipelines construction. We were pleased with the Supreme Court's ruling regarding Appalachian Trail crossing authorization authority, which resolved similar issues for MVP. We were similarly pleased that the Supreme Court partially stayed the Montana Federal Court's decision related to the nationwide 12 permit program and are working with the Army Corps of Engineers on its reissuance of the project's permit. Following comprehensive restudy by the relevant agencies, we expect issuance of MVP's revised biological opinion shortly. Assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues, we are now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during early 2021 and expect an overall project estimate in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.275 billion or $2.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.286 billion and $2.61 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other declined by $0.01 year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher interest expense. NextEra Energy also delivered strong year-to-date operating cash flow growth and for the full year 2020 expects to generate roughly $8.5 billion in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position. NextEra Energy maintains approximately $13 billion in liquidity to support the largest capital investment program in our history. Since last quarter's call, we completed roughly $3 billion in long-term financings, including a $2.2 billion in Capital Holdings debentures. Over the course of the last few months, we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during March and April and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities. Included in these facilities is a total of more than $1 billion in 6 month storm facilities at FPL and Gulf Power, which similar to previous years we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane. Energy Resources also closed two tax equity financings, including its first-ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financings as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. Our year-to-date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time, which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects. NextEra Energy's financial expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021, respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.2. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. In summary, despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward. We have a long-term track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that NextEra Energy is well-positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which continued its strong start to 2020 with growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 23% and 46%, respectively from the prior year comparable quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 26% and 86%, respectively versus 2019. The strong operational and financial performance that NextEra Energy -- highlights the NextEra Energy Partners remained well-positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5775 per common unit or $2.31 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. We are pleased to see PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month. As expected all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification. Following PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy, NextEra Energy Partners received a cash distribution of approximately, $65 million from our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects, which represent current distributions and those previously withheld as a result of the bankruptcy. The release of the Desert Sunlight trap cash supplements NextEra Energy Partners' liquidity, which was approximately $650 million including cash-on-hand at the end of the second quarter. The organic growth investments at NextEra Energy Partners continue to progress well. The approximately 275 megawatts of wind repowering and the Texas pipeline expansion both remain on-track to be in service later this year. We continue to expect to execute on additional attractive growth opportunities as NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio further expands. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $349 million and cash available for distribution was $166 million, up 23% and 46% respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects have resumed, cash available for distribution includes all contributions from PG&E-related projects. New projects added $51 million in adjusted EBITDA and $36 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio. For the second quarter wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 94% in the prior year comparable quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service, primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowerings. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder these results are net of IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners' expectations which remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion and cash available for distribution in the range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at the end of 2020. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved, we will no longer provide CAFD expectations including contributions -- excluding the contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects. As a reminder these expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14 we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February of 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. Similar to NextEra Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations. With the resumption of cash distributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, we now expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners 2020 distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70%, highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextEra Energy Partners has going forward. As we've previously discussed while we will continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners' favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. We are pleased with NextEra Energy Partners' year-to-date performance in 2020 and believe it continues to offer a best-in-class value proposition for investors. The diversity and long-term contracted nature of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions including impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic with the flexibility to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from third parties. NextEra Energy partners has clear visibility into its growth going forward.  Following another strong quarter of origination, Energy Resources' portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than 27 gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that Energy Resources plans to build in the coming years. When combined with the prospects for future renewables development, NextEra Energy Partners' long-term growth visibility remains as strong as ever. NextEra Energy Partners' cost of capital and access to capital advantages including significant demand from various low-cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term. These strengths together with NextEra Energy Partners' favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave NextEra Energy Partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward. In closing, we believe that the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners remains as robust as ever. Both companies remain resilient and well positioned to deliver on their commitments. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and our continued -- and are focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for both customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world's leading clean energy provider. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Julien Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nRichard Ciciarelli: Hey, good morning. This is actually Richie here for Julien. Just had a question around the CapEx raise at FPL and Gulf. What was driving that? Is that more around undergrounding and grid hardening, or is that more on the solar side? And how should we think about the CapEx trajectory from 2021 and beyond? Is that more in line with what you disclosed at your Analyst Day, or should we expect it to be at more of these robust levels going forward?\nRebecca Kujawa: Richie good morning and thanks for the question. I think it really reflects of consistency with what we've been talking about for a long time, which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we're starting to put those in place. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate between 2018 and 2022 of a 9% compound annual growth rate. So, obviously some projects move from one year to another. But at the heart of it, it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers. As far as beyond 2022, similar to comments that we've made in the past, the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses, but specific at FPL and Gulf Power include the modernization efforts including the large deployment of solar over time as well as investments in grid hardening and undergrounding as highlighted by the storm protection plan that we're in the process of going through approvals and initial investments for that program. So we're super excited about the opportunities for investing, and again, stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers.\nRichard Ciciarelli: Got it. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just around your comments around hydrogen. I think you disclosed $65 million for that pilot project. What are you seeing there on that front? Is this more around transportation opportunities, or is this all around like a pipeline and being able to like blend with the pipes?\nRebecca Kujawa: So we're really excited about hydrogen. In particular, when we think about getting to a -- not a net zero emissions profile, but actually a zero carbon emissions profile. And for -- when we looked at this let's call it, 5 years, 10 years ago and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions, we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for our customers. What makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in the 2030 and beyond time frame is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables including wind and solar technologies complemented by short and I'll call it medium-term duration batteries. But then that last amount of emissions that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen. So that's what makes us excited about doing a pilot project. We're very excited about the opportunity to present that to the Florida Public Service Commission as a way to further enhance FPL's ability to innovate and deliver these long-term clean energy solutions to our customers. And as part of that, we'll learn about the technologies, and we'll see what other opportunities there are potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors with \u2013 and for us to be able to produce that \u2013 the green energy to produce the green hydrogen is a potential significant opportunity for us. We think we're at the early stages, which is kind of consistent with our toe in the water approach. We want to get some experience with it. Obviously, do a lot of research and talk to folks in the supply chain and get better equipped to deal \u2013 take advantage of these opportunities. But we're really excited about it.\nRichard Ciciarelli: All right. Thanks a lot. That's all the questions I had.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Richie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nConstantine Lednev: Hi. Good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shar as well. Congratulations on a great quarter. It's \u2013 we've definitely seen some impressive numbers for the backlog additions, and kind of contract increases for the 2022 time frame. Just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts around kind of near growth trajectory and kind of contribution to the business mix. And it's kind of subsided as the conversation point from the rating agencies, but just thoughts on kind of growing contributions from near kind of versus balancing that from the regulated contributions. Kind of does it \u2013 are you thinking about bolt-on acquisitions or kind of any kind of drop-downs accelerated from near? Just some thoughts around that.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Constantine. We appreciate you dialing in this morning. We're really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board. And of course, at FPL and Gulf that's focused on investments that meet \u2013 that need to create value for our customers and at Energy Resources it's return focused along with delivering things for our customers there too. So from a corporate perspective, we don't want to limit any of our businesses, when we find great investment opportunities, which again, I can't highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at Energy Resources. So we're not going to constrain them in any way. We will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders. And to the extent that, we want to maintain balance over time, we've got a lot of opportunities to do that that are accretive for shareholders, including recycling of capital through NextEra Energy Partners, which is obviously a willing and excited acquirer of Energy Resources projects, but Energy Resources has the ability to recycle capital to third parties as well. So there's plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real value-accretive opportunities, and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways.\nConstantine Lednev: Thanks. That's very helpful. And kind of pivoting a little bit to something a little bit longer term, I guess. Can we get some of your thoughts on the November election, and kind of the Biden campaign has put out some plans and frameworks out there, the higher tax rate, clean energy support. How is NextEra positioned for kind of potential changes at the federal level?\nJim Robo: So, this is Jim. We always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections. And so we \u2013 I think, you can remember back close to four years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock, when President Trump was elected. We've managed to completely be fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business, because you know what it's all about economics, right? And the time for renewables is now and that kind of transcends politics frankly the economics and the need to \u2013 and really the need to de-carbonize not only the electric sector, but the rest of the sectors of the economy are really frankly transcend what happens in elections. And so obviously, we watch them closely. We think good clean energy policy is important and the right policy for America in the future. And we continue, I think to be positioned really well regardless of who wins in November.\nConstantine Lednev: Okay. That makes sense. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Thanks so much.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi, good morning, guys. On the same question, Jim, are you \u2013 what do you think is the most likely outcome from the Congress these days tax credit extensions, cash grants? Do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility? I'm just wondering of all those different alternatives, what do you think might actually occur, in the next four years?\nJim Robo: So I think, it's honestly too soon to tell, Michael. I think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election. And is there continued split government or is there not split government that will be I think, a big driver of what policies happen. And I think all of those ideas are on the table. We've been consistent in, what we've said which is, that we think it's important to have a good and fair clean energy policy going forward. We also have said that it's -- that we think wind and renewables with batteries will be -- are very competitive once the PTCs and the ITCs phase out, in terms of competing against conventional generation. It's just honestly, really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final I think policy choices. And so, we are -- obviously we're actively engaged in the discussions. And I think, it's premature really to say, what we think is going to happen. Because I think you have an election in four, five months. And as you all know, elections have consequences. And we'll see what happens post the election in terms of what's going to be the policy landscape going forward.\nMichael Weinstein: Great. And on hydrogen, do you think -- and I noticed there's a lot of -- a lot more emphasis on renewables rather than gas turbines. And your future construction plans at FPL. And I'm just wondering if hydrogen works out, is that a method -- do you think you could actually build more -- put more gas turbines back into the plan, if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative, or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited, such as fuel cells?\nRebecca Kujawa: Mike, I think from a hydrogen perspective and specific to Florida Power & Light Company, we're talking about potential hydrogen opportunities really in the 2030 and beyond timeframe. And in that intervening time we deploy a significant amount of solar technology. And then, if we're right, and if the costs come down for hydrogen, and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile, we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen. So I think for Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power, it's -- at this point and again we're talking about a long way into the future, you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new hydrogen/gas turbines in that portfolio. Because we've got a tremendously efficient fleet that's already in service and the investments we would make are really around conversion. Now, whether or not that's true elsewhere in the country, I think is -- it might be a little bit different, But we're talking about a long way down the road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations. I think it's fairly preliminary.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. And one final question. Just make a comment on M&A interest these days, what's going on with Santee Cooper, et cetera.\nJim Robo: So I think, we -- this won't be surprising. We remain interested in M&A. We think there's a lot that we can bring to the table. I continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run more efficiently and better for customers. And I truly believe that. And so, we continue to look. I think, in terms of Santee Cooper, that process has been pushed to next year. And we remain very interested. And continue to be focused on trying to make that happen.\nMichael Weinstein: All right, Jim could you -- what regions of the country are you focused on? I was just curious?\nJim Robo: We continue to be focused on, the Midwest and the Southeast\u2026\nMichael Weinstein: All right. Thank you very much.\nJim Robo: \u2026 plus FERC-regulated assets pretty much anywhere.\nMichael Weinstein: Perfect. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nDave Arcaro: Hi. Thanks. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. I had one quick follow-up just on the hydrogen topic. Wondering if you see a potential path for this to be an opportunity at NEER? And also in terms of business model, but do you think that you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain? And if so do you have a vision or view on what technology is ahead of others at this point?\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks Dave. I would say at this point we're looking for opportunities across the portfolio, obviously, we talked about the pilot project at FPL today, but we are looking at other pilot type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio consistent with the way that we approach solar early on and of course batteries more recently. So I think there will be opportunities over time for those type of pilot projects. Again where you think of it as actually being close to economic today are areas where there's already significant penetration of renewables, because as you well know, it's critical to find a low-cost electricity supply in order to make it economic or close to economic. And here in the U.S., the economics certainly have to factor in that today there's a very low-cost supply of natural gas, making it the imperative that you find a cheap electricity supply. It's early. Never say never on where we might find opportunities to invest in the business. But historically as you know, we've not played in the space of owning -- being a vertically integrated owner of technologies or projects. We've typically taken the best of manufactured equipment from other folks, apply our scale and our ability to construct, own and operate over the long-term effectively is where we create value. So again it's early. But at this point, I wouldn't think that we would focus on vertically integrating. It's more of applying hydrogen as a technology consistent the way that we've created value in the past.\nJim Robo: So the only thing I would add to that two things. One, is I'd be disappointed if in John's business we don't make some, kind of, pilot investment in the next year. We're looking at a variety of things, and I'd be disappointed if we don't make some, kind of, pilot investment in the next year, a very much toe in the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business. Secondly, clearly we're not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolyzers or anything like that, but I wouldn't rule out us owning them as part of an integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen. And as our view around that would be if we had a long-term contract and obviously we have access to very efficient capital, we know how to operate equipment. We're -- and so a lot of that would come to our -- I think our strategic advantages in terms of how we're able to create value for folks. So I think it's early. We are -- there's clearly an opportunity to five to 10 years from now to displace the last 10% of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen with renewables. That's clear. I think there's also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to displace diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward. And there's also I think clearly an opportunity to make green hydrogen to replace other types of hydrogen or/and other feedstocks in industrial applications. And so we're looking at all of that and we're not being -- all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing, which is this is going to drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demand in this country. And so there is no one better positioned than us to take advantage of that. And we're going to be -- just like we were in battery storage, we're going to be at the vanguard. We're going to -- and we're going to -- this is a big strategic initiative for us and we're going to drive it, and it's going to be very important for this company I think not -- over the next decade. We won't make any money on it in the next five years just like we didn't make any money in batteries in the first five years. And next year we're deploying $1 billion of batteries 10 years later. And so that's the way I think about this. I think about this is help powering the long-term growth of this company into the back half of this decade and the next decade as well.\nDave Arcaro: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you so much for those comments. I just had one other quick M&A follow-up. I was just wondering if -- is there any path for Texas to be a target of interest for you from an M&A perspective, or what would need to change there? Thanks.\nJim Robo: So we have spent a lot of time in Texas. Obviously, we own assets in Texas and so we are a great operator. And we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of the state. We own billions of dollars of assets in the state, right? And we are a great partner for the state. And so, I would never say, never. Obviously, we were extraordinarily disappointed in the Encore decision. We think it was a mistake and shortsighted, but that is what it is. And so, it's probably going to take a bit to get past that before I'm super excited about doing things in Texas from an M&A standpoint.\nDave Arcaro: Understood. Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Lapides: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. I want to turn to Florida for a second. You're supposed to file rate cases next year at both utilities. And obviously, the combination of the two will be a big fact of that. Is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to a, see what happens from a tax perspective in D.C. from a public policy perspective, just so you don't have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two or three year period. And b, is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate review?\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Michael and we appreciate the question. As I've commented, I think even in these prepared remarks, we do continue to believe that FPL and Gulf would file for a combined rate case in early 2021 for new rates effective in 2022. As you highlighted, there's some uncertainties and certain factors that could change, but that's the reality of operating any business. You know what you know those days and you do the best you can for planning for uncertainties. And we certainly would contemplate changes that we're aware of at the time, but you've got to keep running your business. And what's most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in Florida Power & Light and invest at Gulf Power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of our customers. We continue to lead the industry in O&M costs. We continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service. And the best way to keep doing that is execute and that means occasionally having rate cases. We are excited about that prospect. We've been preparing for it for a long time. And we think we have a great story to tell and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at FPL and Gulf. So right -- for now, obviously things could change. But for now, we continue to have those plans to file in 2021 for new rates effective 2022.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And one other question just on the Florida utilities. You have been the industry leader in terms of cost management. Do you think the pace of change in O&M cost declines will stay at this level meaning the year-over-year change or decline rates, or do you think you're reaching a point where it will start to flatten out where the ability to continue to take out as much cost as you've done every year will start to slow?\nRebecca Kujawa: The surest answer to that Michael is we've got a very creative team and we've got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that. But let it -- let me also not underestimate what that requires and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over time. So there's -- we have to work for it. And so every year, we pull together and come up with our best ideas. Do we think over the long period of time that we've exhausted every opportunity? No in part because I think technology will continue to enhance our ability to do that, but it takes time to execute those opportunities. So our discipline is there, our creativity is there, our innovation, our commitment to continuous improvement and we're going to do the best we can to create the best value for our customers.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Rebecca. Much appreciated.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank you for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Jim Robo",
            "content": "So, this is Jim. We always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections. And so we \u2013 I think, you can remember back close to four years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock, when President Trump was elected. We've managed to completely be fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business, because you know what it's all about economics, right? And the time for renewables is now and that kind of transcends politics frankly the economics and the need to \u2013 and really the need to de-carbonize not only the electric sector, but the rest of the sectors of the economy are really frankly transcend what happens in elections. And so obviously, we watch them closely. We think good clean energy policy is important and the right policy for America in the future. And we continue, I think to be positioned really well regardless of who wins in November. So I think, it's honestly too soon to tell, Michael. I think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election. And is there continued split government or is there not split government that will be I think, a big driver of what policies happen. And I think all of those ideas are on the table. We've been consistent in, what we've said which is, that we think it's important to have a good and fair clean energy policy going forward. We also have said that it's -- that we think wind and renewables with batteries will be -- are very competitive once the PTCs and the ITCs phase out, in terms of competing against conventional generation. It's just honestly, really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final I think policy choices. And so, we are -- obviously we're actively engaged in the discussions. And I think, it's premature really to say, what we think is going to happen. Because I think you have an election in four, five months. And as you all know, elections have consequences. And we'll see what happens post the election in terms of what's going to be the policy landscape going forward. So I think, we -- this won't be surprising. We remain interested in M&A. We think there's a lot that we can bring to the table. I continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run more efficiently and better for customers. And I truly believe that. And so, we continue to look. I think, in terms of Santee Cooper, that process has been pushed to next year. And we remain very interested. And continue to be focused on trying to make that happen. We continue to be focused on, the Midwest and the Southeast... ... plus FERC-regulated assets pretty much anywhere. So the only thing I would add to that two things. One, is I'd be disappointed if in John's business we don't make some, kind of, pilot investment in the next year. We're looking at a variety of things, and I'd be disappointed if we don't make some, kind of, pilot investment in the next year, a very much toe in the water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business.

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and continued to perform well both financially and operationally, while managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers, we continue to operate under our pandemic plan that we activated last quarter. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, NextEra Energy's second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 11% versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are well-positioned to meet our overall objectives for the year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.15 year-over-year and its strong execution continues across the board. During the quarter, FPL set a new system peak load of more than 24,500 megawatts. FPL's transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient generating facilities remain available to serve our customers. FPL's continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investments that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions. Consistent with enhancing its best-in-class customer value proposition, last month FPL announced plans to retire share for its last remaining coal unit. Together with our joint interest owner JEA and subject to certain approvals from the Florida Public Service Commission, FPL intends to retire the 847 megawatt coal fired plant in early 2022. The retirement of Scherer 4 is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for FPL customers and prevent roughly four million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit. Scherer 4's retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that FPL launched in 2015 and that will complete the closure of approximately 2,700 megawatts of coal capacity, including the highest greenhouse emitting gas power plants in Florida. These transactions, which will make FPL one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from its generation portfolio demonstrate FPL's continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader. We remain proud of our environmental track record, particularly the CO2 emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout Florida and across the country, and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on operational cost effectiveness at Gulf continues to progress well with year-to-date O&M costs, excluding specific COVID-19-related expenses declining by nearly 10% versus the prior year comparable period and by approximately 25% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safely -- safety with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of June. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we've previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. During the quarter, we completed our annual storm drills for FPL and Gulf Power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety. The drill has provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic. While we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year, consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution, we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most. At Energy Resources, adjusted EPS increased by $0.13 year-over-year. The Energy Resources team continued to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a testament to the Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages including our best-in-class renewables development skills. Our engineering and construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly 650 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately 4,400 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally. While we are monitoring the situation closely, we continue to expect that all of our planned 2020 renewables projects will achieve their in-service dates this year. In response to increased investor focus on environmental, social and governance issues or ESG next week we expect to publish NextEra Energy's updated ESG report, which includes reporting under the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB disclosures. Our company has been focused on all of the elements of ESG for more than 25 years. NextEra Energy's approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our people, our customers, our communities and the environment are proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time. The new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of ESG includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics. Diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they are the right thing to do, but also because diverse and inclusive teams to deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve. Our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry. However, consistent with our focus on continuous improvement, we are not satisfied and we'll continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made in NextEra Energy so far in 2020. Headed into the second half of the year, we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed, even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic. Now let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $749 million or $1.52 per share, which is an increase of $86 million and $0.15 per share respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by more than 10% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 13%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.8 billion in the second quarter and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% allowed under our current rate agreement. During the quarter we utilized $7 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $736 million. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate settlement agreement during 2021. As we've previously discussed, we expect that FPL and Gulf will operate as a single larger Florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers. As a result in May, the company has filed an application with FERC for an approval of an internal reorganization, whereby Gulf would merge into FPL. Subject to FERC approval the companies will merge in January of 2021. However, during 2021, Gulf Power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. We continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in January 2022. Turning to our development efforts, all of our major capital initiatives at FPL remain on track and on budget. During the quarter, the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism of FPL's base rate settlement agreement were placed into service. The 1,200 megawatts of cost-effective solar constructed under the SoBRA mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the early stages of FPL's rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts. The next six SolarTogether projects, totaling approximately 450 megawatts, remain on track to be placed in service later this year. The final 600 megawatts of the roughly 1,500 megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in 2022. Additionally, the 409 megawatt Manatee storage facility, which will be one of the world's largest battery storage plants, is on track and on budget to be complete next year. Based on our ongoing analysis of the long-term potential of low-cost renewables, we remain confident as ever that wind, solar, and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the energy's existing generation -- the country's existing generation fleet, while reducing cost for customers and helping to achieve future CO2 emissions reductions. However, to achieve an emissions-free future, we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long-term potential of hydrogen. Consistent with the toe in the water approach we've previously utilized with solar and battery storage, we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at FPL. This approximately $65 million pilot project which subject to Florida Public Service Commission approval is expected to be in service in 2023 will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce 100% green hydrogen through a roughly 20 megawatt electrolysis system. The hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. We believe that the project is a complement to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights FPL's continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers. We continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses. And while our near-term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program, we are excited about the technology's long-term potential which should further support future demand for low-cost renewables as well as accelerate the de-carbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feedstocks. We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class customer value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $55 million or $0.11 per share, a decline of $0.01 per share relative to Gulf Power's adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period. This quarter results include the impact of roughly $5 million of after-tax COVID-19 related expenses, primarily reflecting the expected incremental bad debt expense as a result of the pandemic. Earlier this month, the Florida Public Service Commission approved Gulf Power's request to record costs attributable to COVID-19; including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on its balance sheet. As a result, the costs recorded during the second quarter are expected to be reversed during the third quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending June 2020. For the full year 2020, we are targeting a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were roughly $170 million and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion. All of Gulf's major smart capital investments including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to progress well. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects an increase in Florida unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes than national averages of each metric. While it is still unclear at this point, how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted, we continue to believe that the financial strength and structural advantages with which Florida entered the crisis and the continued attraction of the state to both new residents and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever. We will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately $75,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's second quarter retail sales decreased by 0.8% year-over-year as customer growth and favorable weather were more than offset by a decline in underlying usage per customer. Based on our analysis, the overall effects of the pandemic on underlying usage during the second quarter were relatively muted. FPL benefits from having its retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers and approximately 40% of its load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance. During April, when stay-at-home orders were broadly in effect, FPL's weather-normalized retail sales were down approximately 4% relative to our expectations. As the economy began reopening in early May, weather-normalized retail sales improved and were above our expectations in June. While the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.3% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales declined by roughly 6.2% year-over-year as a result of the under -- of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage per customer. Over the second quarter, Gulf Power experienced a more significant decline in underlying usage per customer than FPL, but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in May and June. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs, so any variability would therefore have more impact to Gulf's earnings and ROE than at FPL. As a reminder, as we've often discussed, weather normalization is imprecise particularly when evaluating short periods of time. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today's presentation. Let me now turn to Energy Resources which reported second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $481 million or $0.97 per share and adjusted earnings of $531 million or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 or approximately 14% from last year's comparable quarter results, which have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy transmission business formerly reported in Corporate and Other. New investments added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.05 per share as improved wind resource and increased PTC volume from our repower wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the Seabrook nuclear facility. Second quarter fleet-wide wind resource was 99% of the long-term average versus 93% during the second quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy transmission, where contributions increased by $0.03 versus 2019. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year-over-year. These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined $0.04 versus the particularly strong second quarter last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 per share. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success, adding 1,730 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added 708 megawatts of wind, 844 megawatts of solar and 178 megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog. We also executed a build-owned transfer agreement for a 200 megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog additions. All of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the ITC and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers. The continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives, new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel-efficient oil and gas-fired generation units, producing significant long-term renewables demand. Our current backlog now totals approximately 14,400 megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly 20-year development history. To put our backlog into context, it is larger than the current operating wind and solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year-end 2019, highlighting that NextEra Energy continues to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. Only halfway through 2020, we are pleased, we have already signed, nearly 3,500 megawatts of contracts for delivery beyond 2022, which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind, solar and battery storage. To ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years, we now have more than $2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $40 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. These purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we leverage as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position us well for continued long-term growth. The safe harbor equipment also supports additional repowering opportunities, including several hundred megawatts of potential 2021 repowering projects, which we are currently evaluating. As I discussed earlier, all of the 2020 renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in-service dates this year. As a result, we do not expect these projects to rely on the updated treasury start of construction guidance that was released during the quarter. Beyond renewables, we continue to make progress with Mountain Valley Pipeline and work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipelines construction. We were pleased with the Supreme Court's ruling regarding Appalachian Trail crossing authorization authority, which resolved similar issues for MVP. We were similarly pleased that the Supreme Court partially stayed the Montana Federal Court's decision related to the nationwide 12 permit program and are working with the Army Corps of Engineers on its reissuance of the project's permit. Following comprehensive restudy by the relevant agencies, we expect issuance of MVP's revised biological opinion shortly. Assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues, we are now targeting a full in-service date for the pipeline during early 2021 and expect an overall project estimate in the range of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.275 billion or $2.59 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.286 billion and $2.61 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other declined by $0.01 year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher interest expense. NextEra Energy also delivered strong year-to-date operating cash flow growth and for the full year 2020 expects to generate roughly $8.5 billion in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position. NextEra Energy maintains approximately $13 billion in liquidity to support the largest capital investment program in our history. Since last quarter's call, we completed roughly $3 billion in long-term financings, including a $2.2 billion in Capital Holdings debentures. Over the course of the last few months, we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during March and April and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities. Included in these facilities is a total of more than $1 billion in 6 month storm facilities at FPL and Gulf Power, which similar to previous years we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane. Energy Resources also closed two tax equity financings, including its first-ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financings as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. Our year-to-date financing activities are evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time, which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects. NextEra Energy's financial expectations remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70 plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021, respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.2. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in the range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. In summary, despite the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward. We have a long-term track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record. Based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that NextEra Energy is well-positioned to drive long-term shareholder value over the coming years. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which continued its strong start to 2020 with growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 23% and 46%, respectively from the prior year comparable quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by 26% and 86%, respectively versus 2019. The strong operational and financial performance that NextEra Energy -- highlights the NextEra Energy Partners remained well-positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.5775 per common unit or $2.31 per common unit on an annualized basis continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. We are pleased to see PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month. As expected all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification. Following PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy, NextEra Energy Partners received a cash distribution of approximately, $65 million from our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects, which represent current distributions and those previously withheld as a result of the bankruptcy. The release of the Desert Sunlight trap cash supplements NextEra Energy Partners' liquidity, which was approximately $650 million including cash-on-hand at the end of the second quarter. The organic growth investments at NextEra Energy Partners continue to progress well. The approximately 275 megawatts of wind repowering and the Texas pipeline expansion both remain on-track to be in service later this year. We continue to expect to execute on additional attractive growth opportunities as NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio further expands. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $349 million and cash available for distribution was $166 million, up 23% and 46% respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects have resumed, cash available for distribution includes all contributions from PG&E-related projects. New projects added $51 million in adjusted EBITDA and $36 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects also contributed favorably to the significant year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio. For the second quarter wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 94% in the prior year comparable quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service, primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repowerings. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder these results are net of IDR fees since we treat these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners' expectations which remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect December 31, 2020 run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion and cash available for distribution in the range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the portfolio at the end of 2020. Now that the PG&E bankruptcy has been favorably resolved, we will no longer provide CAFD expectations including contributions -- excluding the contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects. As a reminder these expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14 we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February of 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. Similar to NextEra Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations. With the resumption of cash distributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, we now expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners 2020 distribution growth objectives, while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio of approximately 70%, highlighting the significant flexibility we believe NextEra Energy Partners has going forward. As we've previously discussed while we will continue to be opportunistic, NextEra Energy Partners' favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022. We are pleased with NextEra Energy Partners' year-to-date performance in 2020 and believe it continues to offer a best-in-class value proposition for investors. The diversity and long-term contracted nature of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader economic conditions including impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic with the flexibility to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from third parties. NextEra Energy partners has clear visibility into its growth going forward.  Following another strong quarter of origination, Energy Resources' portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than 27 gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that Energy Resources plans to build in the coming years. When combined with the prospects for future renewables development, NextEra Energy Partners' long-term growth visibility remains as strong as ever. NextEra Energy Partners' cost of capital and access to capital advantages including significant demand from various low-cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the long term. These strengths together with NextEra Energy Partners' favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave NextEra Energy Partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward. In closing, we believe that the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners remains as robust as ever. Both companies remain resilient and well positioned to deliver on their commitments. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and our continued -- and are focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for both customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world's leading clean energy provider. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Richie good morning and thanks for the question. I think it really reflects of consistency with what we've been talking about for a long time, which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we're starting to put those in place. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate between 2018 and 2022 of a 9% compound annual growth rate. So, obviously some projects move from one year to another. But at the heart of it, it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers. As far as beyond 2022, similar to comments that we've made in the past, the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses, but specific at FPL and Gulf Power include the modernization efforts including the large deployment of solar over time as well as investments in grid hardening and undergrounding as highlighted by the storm protection plan that we're in the process of going through approvals and initial investments for that program. So we're super excited about the opportunities for investing, and again, stay very focused on ensuring that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers. So we're really excited about hydrogen. In particular, when we think about getting to a -- not a net zero emissions profile, but actually a zero carbon emissions profile. And for -- when we looked at this let's call it, 5 years, 10 years ago and we thought about what it would take to get to true zero emissions, we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for our customers. What makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in the 2030 and beyond time frame is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables including wind and solar technologies complemented by short and I'll call it medium-term duration batteries. But then that last amount of emissions that you would take out of the system to get down to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen. So that's what makes us excited about doing a pilot project. We're very excited about the opportunity to present that to the Florida Public Service Commission as a way to further enhance FPL's ability to innovate and deliver these long-term clean energy solutions to our customers. And as part of that, we'll learn about the technologies, and we'll see what other opportunities there are potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors with \u2013 and for us to be able to produce that \u2013 the green energy to produce the green hydrogen is a potential significant opportunity for us. We think we're at the early stages, which is kind of consistent with our toe in the water approach. We want to get some experience with it. Obviously, do a lot of research and talk to folks in the supply chain and get better equipped to deal \u2013 take advantage of these opportunities. But we're really excited about it. Thank you, Richie. Thanks, Constantine. We appreciate you dialing in this morning. We're really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment across the board. And of course, at FPL and Gulf that's focused on investments that meet \u2013 that need to create value for our customers and at Energy Resources it's return focused along with delivering things for our customers there too. So from a corporate perspective, we don't want to limit any of our businesses, when we find great investment opportunities, which again, I can't highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at Energy Resources. So we're not going to constrain them in any way. We will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders. And to the extent that, we want to maintain balance over time, we've got a lot of opportunities to do that that are accretive for shareholders, including recycling of capital through NextEra Energy Partners, which is obviously a willing and excited acquirer of Energy Resources projects, but Energy Resources has the ability to recycle capital to third parties as well. So there's plenty of ways to ensure that we can create the real value-accretive opportunities, and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways. Thank you. Mike, I think from a hydrogen perspective and specific to Florida Power & Light Company, we're talking about potential hydrogen opportunities really in the 2030 and beyond timeframe. And in that intervening time we deploy a significant amount of solar technology. And then, if we're right, and if the costs come down for hydrogen, and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile, we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen. So I think for Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power, it's -- at this point and again we're talking about a long way into the future, you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new hydrogen/gas turbines in that portfolio. Because we've got a tremendously efficient fleet that's already in service and the investments we would make are really around conversion. Now, whether or not that's true elsewhere in the country, I think is -- it might be a little bit different, But we're talking about a long way down the road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations. I think it's fairly preliminary. Thank you. Thanks Dave. I would say at this point we're looking for opportunities across the portfolio, obviously, we talked about the pilot project at FPL today, but we are looking at other pilot type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio consistent with the way that we approach solar early on and of course batteries more recently. So I think there will be opportunities over time for those type of pilot projects. Again where you think of it as actually being close to economic today are areas where there's already significant penetration of renewables, because as you well know, it's critical to find a low-cost electricity supply in order to make it economic or close to economic. And here in the U.S., the economics certainly have to factor in that today there's a very low-cost supply of natural gas, making it the imperative that you find a cheap electricity supply. It's early. Never say never on where we might find opportunities to invest in the business. But historically as you know, we've not played in the space of owning -- being a vertically integrated owner of technologies or projects. We've typically taken the best of manufactured equipment from other folks, apply our scale and our ability to construct, own and operate over the long-term effectively is where we create value. So again it's early. But at this point, I wouldn't think that we would focus on vertically integrating. It's more of applying hydrogen as a technology consistent the way that we've created value in the past. Good morning, Michael and we appreciate the question. As I've commented, I think even in these prepared remarks, we do continue to believe that FPL and Gulf would file for a combined rate case in early 2021 for new rates effective in 2022. As you highlighted, there's some uncertainties and certain factors that could change, but that's the reality of operating any business. You know what you know those days and you do the best you can for planning for uncertainties. And we certainly would contemplate changes that we're aware of at the time, but you've got to keep running your business. And what's most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in Florida Power & Light and invest at Gulf Power in these great opportunities that we see for the benefit of our customers. We continue to lead the industry in O&M costs. We continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service. And the best way to keep doing that is execute and that means occasionally having rate cases. We are excited about that prospect. We've been preparing for it for a long time. And we think we have a great story to tell and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at FPL and Gulf. So right -- for now, obviously things could change. But for now, we continue to have those plans to file in 2021 for new rates effective 2022. The surest answer to that Michael is we've got a very creative team and we've got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that. But let it -- let me also not underestimate what that requires and that requires the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over time. So there's -- we have to work for it. And so every year, we pull together and come up with our best ideas. Do we think over the long period of time that we've exhausted every opportunity? No in part because I think technology will continue to enhance our ability to do that, but it takes time to execute those opportunities. So our discipline is there, our creativity is there, our innovation, our commitment to continuous improvement and we're going to do the best we can to create the best value for our customers."

With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Robo: Thanks Matt, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been personally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country and the world are facing devastating impacts from the spread of the virus, and we remain resolutely focused on doing our part by continuing to deliver affordable and reliable power. Never before has it been more clear how critical electricity is to the world, and our team is laser focused on ensuring its uninterrupted delivery so first responders can help those in need, businesses can continue to operate where possible, governments can continue to function, and our customers can go about their daily lives to the greatest extent possible during these challenging times. As part of NextEra Energy\u2019s core commitment to do the right thing, at both FPL and Gulf Power we have taken steps to help customers face the challenges that the pandemic has created. Both utilities have suspended electric disconnections during this state of emergency to ensure our customers have continued access to power, regardless of their economic circumstances. Additionally, next month the typical FPL and Gulf Power residential customers will receive a one-time bill decrease of approximately 25% and 40% respectively as an accelerated flow-back of lower fuel costs.  The NextEra Energy companies and employees have also committed more than $4 million emergency assistance funds to provide critical support to the most vulnerable members of the community. Our hope is that these steps will help customers navigate this difficult and unsettling time and support a more rapid recovery for them and the Florida economy generally. We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this pandemic stronger than ever, and we\u2019ll continue to do our part to support that outcome. It is during challenging times like these that the culture of NextEra Energy shines through, a culture focused on leadership, accountability, a passion to be the best, and a focus on flawless execution. NextEra Energy\u2019s employees have exemplified these characteristics over the past several weeks. I am very proud of how they stepped up, once again confirming my belief that we have the best team in the industry and that our culture and our people are our most important asset. Despite their daily lives being disrupted by the ongoing effects of the pandemic, our employees focus on continuing to do their jobs and delivering essential resource for customers and our economy has been unwavering. I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank all NextEra Energy employees for their continued focus, hard work, and execution during these challenging times. It is because of them that I\u2019ve never been more confident in our ability to deliver on all our expectations to our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.  As we focus on execution, the safety of our employees and the community is always our number one priority. To ensure that our critical operations, including the grid within Florida and our generating facilities, particularly our nuclear sites continue to operate safely and remain available to serve our customers, we have instituted our pandemic plan, which was most recently updated last year and have taken aggressive measures to protect our employees.  We understand the critical role that electricity plays in the economy and the daily lives of Floridians, and FLP and Gulf Power remain steadfastly focused on meeting their commitments. As we face the challenges created by the pandemic, we are fortunate that preparedness and crisis planning are in our DNA. For nearly 70 years, we have had annual drills to prepare for disruptions to our business, and while the circumstances of this situation are unique, it is that preparation to deal with the unexpected that is allowing our company to continue to deliver for our customers through this challenging time. Over the past several months, NextEra Energy has continued to execute across the board. Our transmission and distribution systems continue to perform in line with a typical high reliability standards. The more than $5 billion that FPL has invested since 2006 to build a stronger and smarter grid allows us to leverage automation and manage the team D system remotely. That automation and its ability to limit human intervention has never been more important than today. Operations at all our generating facilities at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources have been modified to protect the health and safety of our employees, and the pandemic has not caused any meaningful impacts at this time. In addition to ensuring continued safe and reliable operations at our plants, our nuclear team also delivered outstanding performance during the recent refueling outages at St. Lucie and Point Beach. In fact, the Point Beach refueling outage was one of the shortest outages in our entire nuclear fleet in the past 20 years. The ongoing outages at Turkey Point and Seabrook also continue to progress well. One of our most important core values is our commitment to excellence in all that we do. Over a long period of time, we have invested significant time and effort in developing key strategic partnerships, particularly related to our supply chain, to help support our ability to execute during challenging times like these. Over the past several months, our key strategic partners have continued to deliver, highlighting the value of deep, long-lasting relationships with best-in-class companies. These deep relationships and our position as the industry leader give us confidence that our equipment deliveries should remain on track, even if others face supply issues over the coming months. Our engineering and construction team also continues to perform exceptionally well, keeping the largest construction program in NextEra Energy\u2019s history on schedule and on budget. NextEra Energy\u2019s financial performance for the first quarter reflects this strong operating performance across all our businesses, with adjusted EPS increasing more than 8% year-over-year.  Let me now turn to our strategic focus, which remains unchanged. At FPL and Gulf Power, our focus has been and will continue to be on delivering an outstanding value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions for our customers. The value of FPL\u2019s smart capital investments that we\u2019ve made over the past several decades has never been more clear. These investments, including FPL\u2019s highly efficient generation portfolio and a stronger and smarter grid are allowing FPL to continue efficiently delivering affordable, reliable, and clean energy to our customers. While we continue to monitor the situation, our capital investment program remains on track at FPL and Gulf Power. The investments that we are making today, including one of the world\u2019s largest solar expansions, are expected to provide meaningful customer benefits over the coming years. As we move toward the current challenges, it will be important that we continue to provide low cost reliable service to our customers to support their recovery. The flexibility provided by FPL\u2019s reserve immunization mechanism combined with our best-in-class operational cost effectiveness help position FPL to meet its financial commitments while making smart, long-term investments during this uncertain time. At Gulf Power, we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. Similar to FPL and Gulf Power, our strategic vision at Energy Resources remains unchanged and we believe the market opportunity for low cost renewables has never been greater. In times when consumers and businesses are dealing with the challenges of economic uncertainty, we expect our customers will help ease these impacts by lowering the cost of power to their customers through new, renewable generation.  Reflecting the strong customer demand for renewables, the Energy Resources team had another terrific quarter of origination, adding approximately 1,600 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call, including our first 600 megawatts of wind projects for 2022 and beyond. Most of this quarter\u2019s backlog additions were negotiated remotely while employees operated under stay-at-home orders. The ability to add nearly 1,600 megawatts despite these conditions is a testament to our strong customer relationships, pipeline, and development skills. Also included in these backlog additions are approximately 460 megawatts of battery storage projects, almost all of which will be added to existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers. With the significant recent growth in our battery storage backlog, we increasingly see storage as an important standalone business in its own right. NextEra Energy\u2019s battery storage investments in 2021 are now expected to exceed $1 billion, which we believe would be the largest ever annual battery storage investment by any power company in the world, and have a total gigawatt hour capacity that discharges enough electricity to power the entire of Rhode Island for four hours. This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal, nuclear and less efficient oil and gas biogeneration units. As a result, we expect that the long-term projections for wind and solar that we have previously shared will be achieved or exceeded over the coming decade, representing a tremendous growth opportunity for Energy Resources.  As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day today, we are proud of our track record of improving the environment particularly through the CO2 reductions that we have delivered as a result of our clean energy efforts across the country. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. To capitalize on this significant growth opportunity, Energy Resources expects to extend its long track record of excellence and execution. By leveraging our strong relationships with our equipment suppliers and contractors that I\u2019ve previously mentioned and using the significant experience that we\u2019ve developed over our more than 20 years in the renewable business, we\u2019ve been able to keep our construction program on track despite the significant disruptions that are occurring both globally and locally. Energy Resources\u2019 2020 wind turbine deliveries remain ahead of schedule, and we are not currently experiencing any significant equipment or labor issues at any of the more than 5,000 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year. While we continue to monitor this situation closely, we expect that all of our planned 2020 renewable construction projects will achieve their in-service dates this year and believe that we will extend our track record of never having missed a PTC deadline on one of our wind projects.  Energy Resources\u2019 track record of execution has been a key competitive advantage over time. In periods of uncertainty like we are currently experiencing, we expect customers will increasingly want confidence in a company\u2019s ability to deliver on its commitments. Energy Resources\u2019 extensive experience, combined with our customer, supplier, contractor, and financing relationships all separate us from other developers during these challenging times. In addition, we expect that some of our competitors may falter as a result of these challenges, and we will look to leverage any opportunities that this may present. To support the execution of FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources\u2019 strategic objectives, over the past several months we have focused on ensuring NextEra Energy\u2019s continued strong access to capital. The strength of NextEra Energy\u2019s balance sheet and access to ample liquidity have always been and will always continue to be a core strategic focus for us. In times of financial market disruption like we\u2019ve recently experienced, the value of balance sheet strength and access to liquidity have become even more apparent. We entered the year with meaningful cushion against our credit metrics and access to significant liquidity through the largest and most diversified bank group in our sector and maintenance of the industry\u2019s largest credit facilities.  In the middle of February, we issued $2.5 billion in equity units to add additional cushion against our credit metrics and further supplement our liquidity. Additionally, since the market disruption began, we have further improved our liquidity position with an additional roughly $4 billion in longer term financings, including $1.1 billion in FPL first mortgage bonds, $1.25 billion of capital holdings debentures, and an additional $1.8 billion in capital holdings term loans. Following these issuances, NextEra Energy now has approximately $12 billion in liquidity to help support the largest capital investment program in our history, and we plan to continue to be prudent in our financing plan going forward. In summary, NextEra Energy remains well positioned to continue to execute over both the near and long-term horizons. Over a long period of time, we have focused on building a business that is resilient and able to deliver for our customers and shareholders, regardless of the economic and market conditions. We remain laser focused on extending that track record today. Even throughout the greatest market dislocations last month, NextEra Energy maintained ongoing access to capital, which is a reflection of the strength of its balance sheet as well as the overall resilience of NextEra Energy\u2019s underlying businesses. FPL and Gulf Power operate in what we believe is one of the most constructive regulatory environments in the country. The strength of FPL and Gulf Power\u2019s balance sheets and capital structures combined with the constructive, stable and forward-thinking approach of Florida\u2019s regulatory environment and our long track record of execution should provide investors confidence that both companies will continue to be able to deliver for customers and perform well in a variety of economic environments. At Energy Resources, the portfolio is focused on long-term contracted clean energy projects with high credit quality customers, which we expect will be largely insulated from the changes in the underlying economy.  Despite the current economic challenges and as a result of the strength and diversity of NextEra Energy\u2019s underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings and, most importantly, continuing to reliably deliver for our customers. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, I have confidence in our ability to meet these expectations even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. While the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty throughout the economy, NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives and its commitments. We do not currently expect any material financial or operational impacts as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, as a result of the actions that we took last year, including two significant acquisitions, the organic growth investments that are being executed and the steps taken to reduce its overall cost of capital, NextEra Energy Partners entered 2020 particularly well positioned. This favorable positioning is even more valuable during times of uncertainty like we are experiencing today.  The benefit of last year\u2019s execution is apparent in our first quarter results with adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution increasing roughly 30% and 200% respectively year-over-year. We expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 2020 distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the mid-70% range, even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects, highlighting the significant flexibility NEP has going forward. While we will continue to be opportunistic, the favorable position with which NextEra Energy Partners entered the year gives it the flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022, one year later than we had previously disclosed.  NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 liquidity position also supports its flexibility in achieving its long-term growth objectives. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners maintained a net liquidity position, including cash on hand, of approximately $650 million. NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 only near-term debt maturity is a $300 million convertible debt issuance that matures in September of this year which may be converted to net units if the conversion price is achieved. Without any near-term acquisition needs and no other corporate level debt maturities until 2024, NextEra Energy Partners maintains significant liquidity to help achieve its objectives.  The steps that NextEra Energy Partners has executed in the past year, such as the upsize and extension of its revolving credit facility as well as the project recapitalizations that create significant project finance debt capacity within the NEP portfolio, give us confidence that sufficient liquidity will be maintained. We also expect that the diversification of financing alternatives that NEP has pursued since its IPO will provide flexibility and continued access to capital, regardless of potential disruption in the capital markets. By leveraging the significant private infrastructure capital that has a strong demand for high quality, long-term contracted clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners maintains an attractive additional financing source.  In summary, we believe NEP is well positioned to execute on accretive acquisitions for LP unit holders going forward. With the tremendous expected long-term renewables growth combined with the strength of NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 existing portfolio and continued access to low cost sources of capital, we believe NEP is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry. With access to Energy Resources\u2019 unparalleled portfolio of renewables projects that now totals roughly 25 gigawatts, including assigned backlog, as well as the ability to execute on third party acquisitions and organic growth opportunities, we have as much confidence in NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 long-term future as we ever have had. We look forward to delivering on that potential over the coming years. In closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty throughout the economy, it has not changed the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy or NextEra Energy Partners. Over a long period of time, we\u2019ve focused on building resilient companies that are able to deliver on all their commitments throughout market and economic cycles, and we entered the current period of disruption uniquely well positioned. Despite the ongoing challenges, the core strategic focus across all of our businesses remains unchanged, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives going forward. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rebecca to review the first quarter results. \nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $642 million or $1.31 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 9% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL\u2019s net income growth of roughly 9%. FPL\u2019s capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $5.8 billion and $6.3 billion. FPL\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we utilized $149 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $744 million. The amount of reserve amortization that FPL utilized this quarter was below that which was utilized in the first quarter of 2019. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to continue operating under the base rate settlement agreement through 2021, creating further customer benefits by avoiding a base rate increase during this time. Turning to our development efforts, we recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power that highlights the next phase of smart capital investment opportunities across Florida systems. The filing reflects an expectation that FPL and Gulf Power will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, since the acquisition closed in 2019, FPL and Gulf Power have been reviewing the potential benefits of merging into a single larger Florida utility company. Based on this review, the companies expect that a merger will create both operational and financial benefits for its customers. As a result, FPL and Gulf Power plan to take additional steps to merge over the coming months and continue to expect to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates effective in January of 2022.  The combined 10-year site plan projects an approximately 70% increase in the amount of zero emission electricity that is generated in 2029 relative to 2019 as a result of FPL\u2019s continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30 by \u201830 plan. By the end of this decade, FPL projects it will have more than 10,000 megawatts of installed solar capacity, including nearly 1,600 megawatts within the current Gulf Power service territory. Of this total capacity, approximately 1,500 megawatts are expected to be constructed under FPL\u2019s recently approved Solar Together program, which is the nation\u2019s largest community solar program. Since the official launch of the program last month, customer demand across all rate classes has been substantial with demand from residential customers in one week surpassing the total residential private solar capacity that has been installed over the past 10 years. This strong demand is a reflection of increasing customer interest in cost-effective, clean energy solutions. The innovative program is expected to generate $249 million of total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over its life. Beyond the significant solar expansion, the 10-year site plan also highlights FPL\u2019s other efforts to supply its customers with energy that is both clean and affordable. Relative to last year\u2019s site plan, there is a dramatic increase in the battery storage deployment with a total of approximately 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity now expected by 2029. Additionally, the site plan reflects FPL eliminating essentially all of the coal from its integrated system, including the phase-out of its last operating coal plant within Florida later this year. Finally, this year\u2019s site plan reflects FPL further diversifying its generation portfolio with the elimination of the combined-cycle natural gas plants at FPL and Gulf Power that were previously expected to be constructed in the middle of this decade. This plan reflects our belief that renewable generation, and particularly solar paired with battery storage in Florida, is an increasingly cost effective form of generation in most parts of the U.S. As FPL and Gulf Power execute on these opportunities to further modernize their combined generation fleet, we expect to enhance our customer value proposition while also reducing our CO2 emissions rate, which is already among the lowest in the nation and is targeted to be 67% below the 2005 U.S. electric industry average by 2030. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of FPL\u2019s major capital projects remain on track and on budget. In late January, the first six Solar Together projects totaling approximately 450 megawatts entered service. An additional 450 megawatts of Solar Together sites, as well as the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment, or SOBR mechanism of FPL\u2019s base rate settlement agreement, remain on track to be placed in service this year. Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022.  We continue to expect that FPL\u2019s ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2020 net income of $40 million or $0.08 per share. Gulf\u2019s capital expenditures were $340 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we continue to expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million.  As a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 25% year-over-year. Gulf Power\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.2% for the 12 months ending March 2020. The overall execution of Gulf Power\u2019s capital program continues to progress well. Gulf Power\u2019s first solar project, the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo solar energy center, was placed in service earlier this month. All of its other major capital investments, including the North Florida resiliency connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track. Similar to S&P\u2019s one-notch upgrade of both FPL and Gulf Power in late December, Fitch recently upgraded Gulf\u2019s credit ratings by one notch as well, citing its strong financial position resulting from the reduction in operating costs and ongoing modernization efforts We are pleased with these upgrades, which we believe are a reflection of successful execution since the Gulf Power acquisition closed, and which further strengthen NextEra Energy\u2019s overall credit position. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects Florida unemployment rates beginning to increase and a significant decline in consumer confidence. As Florida continues to deal with the impacts of the pandemic, we are encouraged that the trailing seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases has modestly declined in the past two weeks. While it is unclear at this point how severely the economy will be impacted, we believe the strength with which Florida entered this crisis combined with the continued attraction of its low tax, pro-business policies position Florida well for a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. During the quarter, FPL\u2019s average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately 72,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL\u2019s first quarter retails sales increased 3.3% year-over-year, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL\u2019s retail sales declined by 0.7% as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer.  We continue to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on FPL\u2019s retail sales, which are heavily weighted to residential customers at more than 50%, and we have a very limited exposure to industrial load at less than 3%. Additionally, since approximately 40% of FPL\u2019s load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance, we expect this demand driver to remain relatively stable, especially as we head into the warmer months of the year. Weather-normalized retail sales for the past four weeks are down approximately 2% relative to the prior two years, with increased residential sales partially offsetting declines in other classes; however, this underlying usage decline has been more than offset by strong weather with overall usage in the past four weeks increasing nearly 10% relative to the prior two-year average. While the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage cannot be known at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support a regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current agreement.  For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power\u2019s first quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% year-over-year as customer growth and an increase in underlying usage per customer were largely offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2019. Over the last four weeks, Gulf Power\u2019s weather-normalized retail sales have declined approximately 9% versus the prior two-year average. Similar to FPL, over this period strong weather offset the decline in underlying usage and overall retail sales increased nearly 4% versus the prior two-year average. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset the fluctuations in revenues or costs, so any variability will therefore have more impact to Gulf\u2019s earnings and ROE than on FPL. As we have often discussed, weather-normalization is imprecise and is particularly so when evaluating short periods of time. We are providing our assessment of the changes in load in an effort to be transparent, but caution that these should be considered as indicative and assessed together with the overall changes in usage. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $318 million or $0.65 per share and adjusted earnings of $529 million or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 or approximately 11% from last year\u2019s comparable quarter results. As a reminder, last year\u2019s first quarter results have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy transmission projects formerly reported in the corporate and other segment.  New investments, including more than 1,500 megawatts of new contracted wind and solar projects that were commissioned during 2019, added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets also increased by $0.09 per share due to an improvement in wind resource and increased PTC volume from our re-powered wind projects. Fleet-wide wind resource was at 96%, the long term average, versus 91% during the first quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably were NextEra Energy transmission, where contributions increased by $0.04 versus 2019, and our gas infrastructure business, including our existing pipeline which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year.  These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined $0.02 versus the particularly strong first quarter last year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.10 per share, primarily as a result of increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. As Jim mentioned earlier, Energy Resources\u2019 development team had another strong quarter of origination. Since the last call, we have added 1,590 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog, including 600 megawatts of wind, 420 megawatts of solar, 457 megawatts of battery storage, and 113 megawatts of wind re-powering projects. With this quarter\u2019s backlog additions and with two and a half years remaining in the period, we are now well within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year. At this early stage, we are tracking extremely well against the total development forecast for this period and our backlog continues to track against the assumptions supporting our previously announced financial expectations. For the post-2022 period, our backlog now includes wind, solar and storage projects totalling approximately 3,200 megawatts, placing us far ahead of our historical originations at this stage and further supporting Energy Resources\u2019 long-term growth visibility. Beyond renewables, we continue to work with our partners on Mountain Valley Pipeline and with the relevant agencies to resolve the issues related to MVP\u2019s biological opinion. We are encouraged by the tone of the oral arguments at the Supreme Court on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline\u2019s case related to its Appalachian Trail crossing authorization and remain hopeful that the Fourth Circuit Court\u2019s original decision will be overturned, resolving similar issues for MVP.  We are also evaluating the recent Montana federal court decision supporting to enjoin the Army Corps of Engineers from issuing permits under the Nationwide 12 program. We believe the ruling out of the court is incorrect and anticipate that the federal government will seek to fix the situation rapidly. Assuming a successful resolution along the currently expected timeline of all of these issues, we continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and expect an overall project estimate of approximately $5.4 billion. Turning now to consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $421 million or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2020 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.17 billion and $2.38 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, NextEra Energy\u2019s current liquidity position is approximately $12 billion, ensuring that we are well positioned to execute on our strategic plans regardless of potential market disruptions. The financing that we have executed year-to-date represents a significant portion of our expected 2020 financing plan, and we remain confident about our ability to execute the financing plan for the balance of the year and beyond. In the near term, we have the positive cash balances helping to ensure ample liquidity as we execute on our current investment programs. Energy Resources currently has commitments for substantially all of its expected 2020 tax equity financings, which we expect to close as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. The financial expectations which we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy\u2019s adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20, and as Jim highlighted, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in a range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As Jim noted, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. As we announced in February, the board of NextEra Energy approved an updated dividend policy for beyond 2020 which is expected to translate to a growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2022, off of a 2020 base. The board\u2019s approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a reflection of the continued strength in earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, and we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $294 million and cash available for distribution, including all distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects in both periods, was $130 million, up 31% and more than 200% respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners would have achieved CAFD growth of 187% versus 2019. Contributions from portfolio acquisitions and an improvement in wind resource were the principal drivers of growth. New projects added $54 million of adjusted EBITDA and $44 million of cash available for distributions.  For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 89% in the first quarter of 2019. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service primarily as a result of the retirement of the outstanding notes at our Genesis project and the receipt of higher year-over-year payco [ph] payments. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees since we consider these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.555 per common unit, or $2.22 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth rate range. As Jim mentioned earlier, the transactions that NextEra Energy Partners executed in 2019 allowed it to enter 2020 well positioned to withstand the recent market turmoil.  During 2019, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $1.8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings. With low initial coupons, the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unit holders, which we expect will allow NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth and therefore also reduce future financing needs. The benefits of these financings are a large reason that NextEra Energy Partners now has the flexibility to execute on its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2022. At times of market stress, reduced future asset and financing needs are a tremendous advantage and help further improve NextEra Energy Partner\u2019s ability to execute on its long-term growth objectives.  As NextEra Energy Partners advanced towards its organic growth investments in 2019, it took steps to support the financing for these investment opportunities as well. Through the recapitalization of the Texas pipelines, a project finance facility related to the Meade pipeline expansion project, and its advance discussions for tax equity financing related to the two wind re-powerings, NextEra Energy Partners expects to finance these accretive investments through attractive sources of long-term capital.  Last year, NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis project. Assuming favorable resolution for our PG&E related assets, about which we continue to remain confident, the cash flows from the Genesis project can support significant long-term financing capacity. Additionally, following PG&E\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy, we expect cash that is currently trapped at our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects to be distributed.  As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $48 million of distributions have been restricted or withheld at the projects. The Genesis financing capacity and the release of the Desert Sunlight trapped cash are additional potential sources of capital and liquidity for NextEra Energy Partners.  Finally, over the last year NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 revolving credit facility was upsized by $500 million to $1.25 billion, and the term was extended out to 2025. This incremental liquidity further supports NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 financing position and provides flexibility in how NEP executes on its long-term growth objectives.  Prudent capital management is a hallmark of our approach to how we manage all of our businesses. As a result of the actions taken over the past year, we believe NextEra Energy Partners is particularly well positioned to achieve its long-term growth expectations.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 expectations, which remain unchanged. Including full contributions to PG&E related projects, year-end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2020 run rate for CAFD to be in the range of $505 million to $585 million.  Year-end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, which assumes full contributions from the projects related to PG&E as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized.  Similar to NextEra Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with these expectations. As a reminder, all of our expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. As I previously noted, NextEra Energy Partners now expects to be able to achieve its long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2022.  In summary and as Jim highlighted, we continue to believe that despite the ongoing challenges in the market and the economy, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to execute and maintain their excellent prospects for growth. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are focused on delivering shareholder value going forward. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Oh, it looks like we\u2019re going to go with Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. \nShahriar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning. \nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning \nShahriar Pourreza: A couple questions here. First on the regulatory side, we\u2019ve seen commissions get a bit challenged in 2020, proceedings, they\u2019re delaying schedules. In some states the process to reengage is kind of open-ended. I know you have one of your peers who\u2019s looking to file in Florida later this year and you guys aren\u2019t planning to file a GRC until early next year, combining the two entities.  That said, you guys are in the process of preparing, you\u2019re fact finding, you\u2019re meeting with various stakeholders within and outside of NextEra. Are you seeing any sort of COVID-related delays, especially as you\u2019re currently setting up to file a rate case in early next year?\nRebecca Kujawa: Shahriar, I appreciate the question, and of course regulatory--you know, any sort of procedures and questions that we have in front of the regulators are top of mind to us, but as we\u2019ve highlighted over the last couple of months and very typical with prior preparation, our focus for this year ahead of our potential filing at the beginning of next year is really preparation and laying a lot of groundwork. At this stage in April, we\u2019ve got a lot of time between now and year-end and really into the beginning of next year to evaluate how things have changed and adapt accordingly.  But at this point, our team\u2019s focus is very much on the preparation, and we continue to progress well on that.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it, then just on near, obviously a very solid addition to the backlog, and you\u2019ve certainly--you and Jim gave a pretty good development landscape in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing any hesitation on the part of counterparties? Does the current economic backdrop kind of deteriorate some of these counterparties? You still have about 4.5 to 5 gigawatts that are waiting for PPAs over the next couple of years, so I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any kind of counterparties balk.\nRebecca Kujawa: Shahriar, we\u2019re very pleased with where we are. Obviously highlighted in the prepared remarks that we are now well within the range for the development expectations that we laid out last year, which at this stage in progression towards the end of 2022, we are very well positioned to execute on everything that we\u2019ve laid out. More specifically in the last couple of weeks, as we also highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and the Energy Resources team have executed terrifically well and many, if not most of those contracts that we highlighted have been signed since the pandemic was starting to emerge and ultimately top of mind of our customers.  If you think about the backdrop of why that might be, renewables are the least cost form of generation and in many cases are far cheaper than the alternative form of generation that\u2019s continuing to operate very expensive and inefficient, coal and some nuclear facilities, and our customers will save their customers money when they turn those plants off and replace them with renewables. We would expect that as our customers focus on what\u2019s best for their customers, they will continue to want to build renewables into their portfolios and we\u2019re very well positioned to execute.\nJohn Ketchum: Shahriar, this is John. I may just add onto that. We are seeing just a terrific development environment in front of us, for all the reasons that Rebecca mentioned. The fact that we buy cheaper, we build cheaper, we operate cheaper, we have the best development skills in the industry, customers more than anything right now want confidence and certainty that a project is going to get built, so we are actually seeing more opportunities come our way. Given that we compete against a lot of small players in both solar and wind, access to capital and a balance sheet, which we have, are extremely important and are something that we plan to leverage to create even more opportunities going forward. So actually, the current environment has created a better environment for us.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Jim, just one strategy question for you - I know you love to address these. There\u2019s obviously been a lot of valuation dispersions in this space - you know, Jacksonville and Santee Cooper, it looks like they\u2019re done. You\u2019ve been highlighted in media with potential interest in Kansas and Missouri. Do you have any sort of refreshed thoughts, especially given the recent lost opportunities I just mentioned, as you think about consolidation? \nJames Robo: So first of all, just to address Santee Cooper for a moment, Santee Cooper is by no means done. I think you all saw the speaker of the house sent a letter to Santee Cooper, calling them a rogue agency. The governor wants to sell them, so it\u2019s not done. The disagreements in the senate around what to do with Santee Cooper led to a bit of a standoff around the budget in the middle of the pandemic, and you can--you know, obviously it\u2019s a topic that is quite hotly debated in South Carolina. But I would say by no means is Santee Cooper done, and there remains a lot of energy still behind wanting to sell Santee Cooper. Just strategically overall from an M&A standpoint, I always like to just remind everyone always what our gating elements of anything that we would do. It has to make sense strategically, has to be significantly accretive. You all know how we finance these things historically - it\u2019s been with very little risk. I\u2019m not a big believer in financing these things in a way that either takes risk or puts the balance sheet at risk. A strong credit rating is really critical to us and critical to our strategy, so all those things remain the same. I think what you\u2019re going to see in terms of the environment obviously is with the uncertainty in the financial markets and the uncertainty with the economy that\u2019s been driven by the pandemic, I think you\u2019re going to see counterparties take a pause. That\u2019s a natural reaction to the environment that we\u2019re in. But our strategic thinking around it remains unchanged and our approach to it remains unchanged, in that it has to be strategic, has to be accretive, has to be consistent with a very strong balance sheet.\nShahriar Pourreza: Congrats, guys, on these results. Congrats again.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Good morning. Just a couple questions on NEP. Initially the extension of not needing any new assets, I guess through the end of \u201921, to meet your dividend growth targets, is that also true for any equity financing through then?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, essentially Steve. There wouldn\u2019t be any need. Obviously we have the existing convertible equity portfolio financings and the convertible to debt that would potentially convert into equity, and it\u2019s later this year, but there\u2019s no new issuances required. We highlighted on the prepared remarks that we have significant liquidity far in excess of what we would need, particularly since we don\u2019t need acquisitions to meet those distribution growth targets until 2022.\nSteve Fleishman: Then secondly, I think there was a comment, and I guess it was Jim\u2019s slide, that the private infrastructure capital demand for high quality clean energy assets provides attractive financing source, even in this environment or regardless of market conditions. Maybe you can give a little more color on your thought process there.\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes Steve, as you well know, one of the things that we\u2019ve been particularly attuned to over the last, call it 18 months, is that there is a lot of private infrastructure capital, and the evidence of that is apparent with the convertible equity portfolio financings that we\u2019ve executed since that time. Since the--you know, I\u2019ll just call it the pandemic time frame, so in the last couple of months, there has continued to be a significant amount of inbound interest and continuing conversations with a number of those parties to provide capital to NEP in various forms, so we have not seen any changes in interest moving forward and continue to be very confident in our ability to leverage those type of capital resources as we move forward.  We\u2019re fortunate we\u2019re in a position that we don\u2019t need to do anything, as we highlighted, until 2022, but we of course will continue to be opportunistic, and to the extent that there are good opportunities for NEP that are attractive and accretive to NEP unit holders, we may well take advantage of that. \nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Then a last question, just on renewables overall. I think if I understood right, you\u2019re seeing the same amount of demand for growth, so no change there. John, you mentioned the fact that people maybe want a stronger counterparty these days, but then the other thing I think I heard someone say was--it might have been Jim, saying the opportunities might be there more for acquisitions or projects that people struggle to get done in time. Could you maybe talk on that last point and how meaningful that opportunity could be?\nJames Robo: Steve, I think it could be quite meaningful. If you look back at \u201908 and \u201909, we had a lot of opportunities in that time where you had developers who didn\u2019t have great access to capital, and we were a source of capital for them.  I just want to reiterate something that John said. If anything, the renewable market is better right now that I ever expected it to be. I just got through with a review of our entire portfolio of projects and activity last week, and honestly I was really struck by the acceleration of activity that we\u2019re seeing, so it is full speed ahead on that front and I was very encouraged to see that. It was really, as we said in the prepared remarks, a real testament to the strength of our development team and the strength of our pipeline and the strength of our people and our relationships.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Just coming back to the first part with the Florida utilities quickly, when you think about the reserve amortization, the available balance here, the trajectory for load as you see it, and again I understand there\u2019s numerous caveats, I think I heard it in the commentary but just want to clarify - confidence that the balance that you have for this year will suffice, and then perhaps more importantly and critically, as you look towards whatever that normalization is in subsequent years and a rate case cycle, how do you think about implementing something like reserve amortization subsequently again as you look at the post-rate case period here to minimize some of the earnings vol?\nRebecca Kujawa: Okay, let me start with the reserve amortization. We highlighted in the remarks that the balance is now at $744 million and we continue to have confidence that cost containment and all of the factors that are pluses and minuses to that reserve amortization balance will continue to be sufficient for us to operate under the settlement agreement through the end of 2021, so really no change to our expectations that we, again, would file a rate case in \u201921 for new rates effective in 2022. Reserve amortization has been, we think, a very constructive concept in Florida regulation, particularly FPL over a number of different settlement agreements and ultimately rate case outcomes, but it has come about from settlements, so it\u2019s not something you would assume that we will have going forward. But we think it has been very good for customers because it\u2019s been able to provide long term rate stability for them through a variety of conditions, including the one that we find ourselves in today. We are very pleased with the constructive nature of regulations that we have been operating on, and again particularly so for the benefit of customers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it, excellent. Then coming back to the renewable side of the business, obviously you guys have an incredible amount of confidence given the backdrop here. You\u2019re not seeing even any slippage in timelines, especially as you think about the C&I customers here? I know the gross amount of backlog that you guys are talking about seems pretty confident, but even just execution and prospective backlog that you would conceivably add in 2022, that is even staying relatively firm? I\u2019ll leave it there.\nJohn Ketchum: No drop-off, no slowdown. One of the things that we were able to add this year, or this quarter, was 600 megawatts to 2022 and beyond of wind, which is just a terrific head start, that we\u2019re only here in the first quarter of 2020, so just tons of time to continue to be able to work the wind development pipeline over the next four years, with PTC being essentially at 60% through 2024. Just a lot of demand, a lot of folks that own peakers, a lot of folks that own coal very aggressively looking at renewable as an option with ESG as a tailwind. Knowing that even if we are in a recessionary environment, being able to pivot to renewables not only brings a clean energy story but it also makes their economies more competitive and lowers bills for customers at a time they need it most, so that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving demand.\nRebecca Kujawa: I was just going to add to that something about the--you know, one of the important reasons why we continue to be confident about our ability to reach our CODs, keep our projects on track and on budget, is really something we\u2019ve highlighted for years now - our focus on our supply chain and developing relationships with our vendors, strategic partners in many cases. As we went into this year, knowing that it was a significant construction development year at all of our businesses, we had intense focus on our supply chain. We always do, but even more so this year with how complex and intertwined it may be with how many priorities and the deliverables we have. Entering into that posture and facing the circumstances we find ourselves in now positioned us well to manage through these. We pick top quality suppliers where we are a significant customer to them, and we\u2019ve had many instances over the last couple of weeks where we\u2019ve worked closely with them to ensure that our projects stay on track and on budget. I don\u2019t think that should be underestimated. Focusing on long term total cost of ownership and ability for our suppliers to deliver is really paying off well for us in this type of environment. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Last quick clarification - on the NWP12 permit you guys alluded to, seems like you\u2019ve got pretty good confidence that they\u2019re going to narrow that back to just Montana, but process-wise, make sure I\u2019ve got it right there on your confidence level?\nJames Robo: Julien, I think it\u2019s premature to say what\u2019s going to happen with that. I think it\u2019s obviously a condition to--it being dealt with quickly is a condition to us being able to deliver the pipeline this year. We think the ruling was incorrect and we think government is going to aggressively try to correct it. That said, it\u2019s still early on. We haven\u2019t really gotten a lot of feedback yet from the government about what their approach is going to be, and we are continuing to evaluate it. I think it\u2019s early days, honestly Julien, is what I would say to you right now on that.  If our prepared remarks led you to believe that we had confidence that it\u2019s going to be done--that it\u2019s going to get resolved quickly, that was not what we were trying to say. We were trying to say that for us to build the pipeline this year, it needs to be resolved quickly, and it remains to be seen whether it will be. It\u2019s something that we as a team are very--along with our partners, are very focused on working with the government to get it resolved, and get it resolved quickly. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, thank you guys. Best of luck, stay safe.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hi, good morning.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: I wanted to see if you had a strong view on the potential for further federal support for clean energy. I\u2019m thinking just more broadly as part of stimulus efforts that are underway. Do you see anything that might translate into concrete additional support?\nJames Robo: Stephen, it\u2019s Jim. I think it\u2019s too early to tell. I think there is certainly some interest from the Democrats to include additional clean energy support in another stimulus bill potentially around--you know, with a focus on infrastructure. But as you\u2019ve seen over the last several weeks, things are extraordinarily fluid in Washington, and I would just say it\u2019s too soon to tell. I think it\u2019s something as an industry that we need to be very thoughtful about in terms of how we approach it and have it be truly focused on stimulus and focused on the impacts of the pandemic, and make sure that that\u2019s the focus of any of the efforts that go on in the industry. You know, we\u2019re staying obviously very close to it and time will tell, but as I said, I think it\u2019s a little early and things are quite fluid.\nStephen Byrd: Understood, very fair. Just one last one. You\u2019ve given some good info on power demand impacts from COVID-19. I\u2019m wondering if you could just speak to the customer class impacts - there\u2019s a lot of questions about the magnitude of uplift in terms of residential demand versus the downward movement for commercial industrial. I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing on the residential side, if you\u2019re able to share that.\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes Stephen, one of the things that we did, we put it in the appendix, Slide 25 if you have a chance to take a look at it, is to give you some sensitivities for the revenue impacts for a percentage--you know, 1% change in sales, also the breakdown of our composition of mix between residential, C&I--well, commercial, and then separately industrial. Obviously our load mix at FPL, which is the significant majority of the regulated load that we have in our business, is heavily weighted towards residential and small and medium commercial businesses. We have seen pick-up in residential, as we highlighted, and a slight down tick in commercial. But as I also highlighted in the prepared remarks, and very consistent with what we\u2019ve said to you over a long period of time, our ability to dissect the impacts from weather versus underlying usage are pretty good over a long period of time, but in short discrete periods of time are more challenging, particularly when weather has a significant impact on load.  In these last couple of weeks since you would say that there have been significant impacts from pandemic, and officially the stay-at-home orders here in Florida were in effect, we\u2019ve had very favorable weather, so it\u2019s hard for us to dissect it, so we erred on the side of providing you some sensitivities so that you can make an assessment on your own as to what you think might happen and what would that would be in terms of cash revenues at FPL.  Again, to put a finer point to it, remember with reserve amortization that results in negligible or no impact. To the extent that we have reserve amortization available to us on an earnings basis, this would be just a cash impact.  To give context for what happened in the last major disruption to load, which was the 2008 - 2009 recession, obviously everywhere but including here, of course, in Florida, that was about a 4% to 6.5% effect to overall load demand, and that was over the course of the year, and obviously we\u2019re midyear this year. That gives you some guideposts for how to think about it from the way that we\u2019ve approached it so far.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. Yes, you\u2019ve got a lot of insulation to the bottom line from the impacts from COVID. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much. \nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you Stephen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi guys. To what extent is wind re-powering at NEP responsible for or contributing to the ability to avoid drop-downs over the next year and a half to two years?\nRebecca Kujawa: Michael, it\u2019s certainly a positive. As we, I think, announced these re-pairing opportunities at or near the investor conference last year and have planned for it in terms of how we would finance it and have the tax equity lined up to be able to finance that going forward, so it\u2019s certainly a positive that will impact results for this year. It\u2019s about $25 million worth of CAFD or so, as we\u2019ve previously highlighted, so certainly a contributor.  Also a contributor were the other acquisitions that NEP made last year, as well as the recapitalizations that we executed on. It\u2019s the confluence of acquisitions, both from Energy Resources as well as third parties, as well as the organic opportunities, so it\u2019s a three-for in this case.\nMichael Weinstein: I think last quarter, you also talked about the possibility of additional in 2024 due to the PTC extension. Have you ever quantified any of that, what that opportunity may be?\nRebecca Kujawa: We haven\u2019t talked about additional re-powering opportunities with respect to NextEra Energy Partners. As we\u2019d previously highlighted, from a re-powering opportunity we thought the opportunity was particularly strong through the end of 2020 to take advantage of the full 100% PTC re-upping. But actually this quarter, we\u2019re announcing some re-powering opportunities in 2021 that will take advantage of the 80% PTC, so it\u2019s a very positive opportunity for us.\nMichael Weinstein: Right, got you. One last question about natural gas versus renewables. Natural gas has gotten a lot cheaper, and I\u2019m just wondering how do renewables stack up on an LCOE basis these days against fossil fuels?\nRebecca Kujawa: I\u2019m sorry, Michael - how does LCOEs for renewables stack up against--?\nMichael Weinstein: Against fossil fuels. Fossil fuel prices have really come down, right?\nRebecca Kujawa: They definitely have come down, but you would hope that someone making a long-term planning decision will think about prices over a long period of time. As we highlighted for FPL\u2019s 10-year site plan and we looked at what the costs are that we\u2019re anticipating at Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power together, solar paired with battery storage are the least cost form of generation, and we\u2019ve put all that pen to paper and included that in our 10-year site plan, and have now removed the two combined-cycle natural gas plants that we had previously in the forecast in the mid-2020s as a reflection of where we think costs are.  From our customer standpoint, again they operate in many different jurisdictions, in some cases wind will be particularly attractive, in some cases it\u2019s solar. But if you keep in context the dollar per megawatt hour costs that we\u2019ve continued to provide, which with incentives are for wind, anywhere in the teens to very low 20s for wind, even in low wind resource areas, and then for solar in the [30-plus] megawatt hour with incentives, and then post incentives continue to be very attractive in that $20 to $30 and $30 to $40 megawatt hour range, so very cost competitive even with where we think the fuel complex pricing is. But also, remember that coal and some nuclear facilities are our primary comparisons, and that hasn\u2019t changed dramatically.\nJohn Ketchum: Michael, this is John. One thing I would add to that is remember as oil prices have come down, rig counts have come down in the Permian, which means there\u2019s a lot less associated gas, which has really actually helped natural gas prices, and we\u2019ve seen a bit of an uptick in natural gas prices, particularly recently. When we are out originating new renewables, we really have not seen competition from gas-fired units for that reason. They still remain kind of in that $30 to $40 a megawatt hour range versus wind, which is still in the teens in most parts of the country, and then solar in that mid-20 range. So very, very competitive when you look at renewables versus gas-fired generation. The last thing I would add is just peakers. Remember gas-fired peakers not only are targets for new renewables, but also for battery storage. Battery storage costs have come down such that--you know, we mentioned the large standalone storage build-out that we have, the billion dollars going in, in \u201921. There is a significant opportunity in almost every part of the country where batteries are now more economic than gas-fired peakers, even at today\u2019s natural gas prices.\nMichael Weinstein: Good news, thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Thank you, guys for taking my question. I don\u2019t know if this one is for Jim or John. I know you commented that your own renewable development plans remain on track, on schedule and financed. You have a great lens into the industry overall, obviously. Can you talk about where you think for the industry, maybe not for NextEra, where the biggest challenges are occurring? Are they in financing of projects, meaning tax equity markets? Are they in the supply chain? Is it more wind versus solar supply chain issues? Is it more keeping sites or potentially missing safe harbor dates? Can you just talk about the industry perspective, what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive landscape, even if these are things that aren\u2019t necessarily impacting NextEra?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. I think the first one would be supply chain, and Rebecca talked about that for a minute; but given the size of our spend across the complex, being right around north of $13 billion, we are almost always our suppliers\u2019 largest customer. If we\u2019re not, we\u2019re their second largest in the world. If there are minor disruptions that come up, we\u2019re able to pivot to other manufacturing facilities that that particular vendor may own, so we don\u2019t see the same impact that perhaps a smaller player, whether it\u2019s in wind and solar, would see. So while they may see supply chain disruptions, we don\u2019t, just given the size and the sophistication and the buying power that we have. That\u2019s the first one - supply chain is something that I would look at for other smaller players. The second one is access to capital. Again, we always get first dibs and first allocations on tax equity financing. In the script remarks, I think we already said we have all of our tax equity needs for 2020 fully allocated. That is not the case necessarily for smaller developers. Smaller developers might struggle, particularly to the extent that banks have less amount of taxable income, notwithstanding the five-year net operating loss carry-back that was passed, I think in the first or second federal restructuring, so we\u2019re very well positioned from a tax equity standpoint, whereas maybe smaller developers might not be. I think for those two reasons, it could create project M&A opportunities for us, where some of these smaller developers need a rescue plan because they\u2019re going to be running up against issues at the end of the year. I think they also--it\u2019s not only on execution in terms of meeting year-end CODs, where we don\u2019t see issues and we have the ability to navigate around them, but as customers now are looking for who to select to build renewables for them going forward, knowing that there\u2019s a PTC declining clock, there\u2019s an ITC declining clock, they want certainty. They want confidence that that developer is going to be around to be able to actually deliver, so in RFPs and just in customer interactions, we\u2019re starting to see that theme play out more and more.  We feel really good about our ability to execute and we feel very bullish about our origination activities going forward for those reasons, which might not be the case of what you would hear from a smaller developer for those reasons.\nMichael Lapides: John, thank you for that. One quick follow-up. In the supply chain, when you\u2019re seeing it across the industry, obviously not impacting you guys, are the issues greater for smaller wind developers or smaller solar? Where are you seeing the bottlenecks within the industry more on the supply chain side?\nJohn Ketchum: I think probably a little bit of both. It depends on where they\u2019re sourcing from and which OEM that they're using. Some OEMs have more alternatives to parts of the country that are less--parts of the world that are less affected, but I think you\u2019re going to see disruptions on both wind and solar for smaller developers. We have always made selections around our OEM providers and around our panel providers which are pretty diverse - inverters, things of that nature that give us a lot of flexibility, but a smaller developer may be beholden to one particular OEM that might not have the same amount of flexibility or one supplier, given how small their build is, that might have a disruption without the ability to pivot to somebody else.\nMichael Lapides: Got it, thank you John. Much appreciated. \nJohn Ketchum: You\u2019re welcome, Michael, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. The conference has now concluded.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you Jim, and good morning everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $642 million or $1.31 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 9% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of roughly 9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $5.8 billion and $6.3 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement. During the quarter, we utilized $149 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $744 million. The amount of reserve amortization that FPL utilized this quarter was below that which was utilized in the first quarter of 2019. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect this year to be no different. We continue to expect that FPL will end 2020 with a sufficient amount of reserve amortization to continue operating under the base rate settlement agreement through 2021, creating further customer benefits by avoiding a base rate increase during this time. Turning to our development efforts, we recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power that highlights the next phase of smart capital investment opportunities across Florida systems. The filing reflects an expectation that FPL and Gulf Power will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. As we've previously discussed, since the acquisition closed in 2019, FPL and Gulf Power have been reviewing the potential benefits of merging into a single larger Florida utility company. Based on this review, the companies expect that a merger will create both operational and financial benefits for its customers. As a result, FPL and Gulf Power plan to take additional steps to merge over the coming months and continue to expect to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of 2021 for new rates effective in January of 2022.  The combined 10-year site plan projects an approximately 70% increase in the amount of zero emission electricity that is generated in 2029 relative to 2019 as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30 by \u201830 plan. By the end of this decade, FPL projects it will have more than 10,000 megawatts of installed solar capacity, including nearly 1,600 megawatts within the current Gulf Power service territory. Of this total capacity, approximately 1,500 megawatts are expected to be constructed under FPL's recently approved Solar Together program, which is the nation's largest community solar program. Since the official launch of the program last month, customer demand across all rate classes has been substantial with demand from residential customers in one week surpassing the total residential private solar capacity that has been installed over the past 10 years. This strong demand is a reflection of increasing customer interest in cost-effective, clean energy solutions. The innovative program is expected to generate $249 million of total net cost savings for participating and non-participating customers over its life. Beyond the significant solar expansion, the 10-year site plan also highlights FPL's other efforts to supply its customers with energy that is both clean and affordable. Relative to last year's site plan, there is a dramatic increase in the battery storage deployment with a total of approximately 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity now expected by 2029. Additionally, the site plan reflects FPL eliminating essentially all of the coal from its integrated system, including the phase-out of its last operating coal plant within Florida later this year. Finally, this year's site plan reflects FPL further diversifying its generation portfolio with the elimination of the combined-cycle natural gas plants at FPL and Gulf Power that were previously expected to be constructed in the middle of this decade. This plan reflects our belief that renewable generation, and particularly solar paired with battery storage in Florida, is an increasingly cost effective form of generation in most parts of the U.S. As FPL and Gulf Power execute on these opportunities to further modernize their combined generation fleet, we expect to enhance our customer value proposition while also reducing our CO2 emissions rate, which is already among the lowest in the nation and is targeted to be 67% below the 2005 U.S. electric industry average by 2030. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, all of FPL's major capital projects remain on track and on budget. In late January, the first six Solar Together projects totaling approximately 450 megawatts entered service. An additional 450 megawatts of Solar Together sites, as well as the final 300 megawatts of solar being built under the solar base rate adjustment, or SOBR mechanism of FPL's base rate settlement agreement, remain on track to be placed in service this year. Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022.  We continue to expect that FPL's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate and regulatory capital employed of approximately 9% from 2018 through 2022, while further enhancing our best-in-class value proposition. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2020 net income of $40 million or $0.08 per share. Gulf's capital expenditures were $340 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we continue to expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million.  As a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 25% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.2% for the 12 months ending March 2020. The overall execution of Gulf Power's capital program continues to progress well. Gulf Power's first solar project, the roughly 75 megawatt Blue Indigo solar energy center, was placed in service earlier this month. All of its other major capital investments, including the North Florida resiliency connection and the Plant Crist coal to natural gas conversion continue to remain on track. Similar to S&P's one-notch upgrade of both FPL and Gulf Power in late December, Fitch recently upgraded Gulf's credit ratings by one notch as well, citing its strong financial position resulting from the reduction in operating costs and ongoing modernization efforts We are pleased with these upgrades, which we believe are a reflection of successful execution since the Gulf Power acquisition closed, and which further strengthen NextEra Energy's overall credit position. Similar to other parts of the country, the Florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent economic data reflects Florida unemployment rates beginning to increase and a significant decline in consumer confidence. As Florida continues to deal with the impacts of the pandemic, we are encouraged that the trailing seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases has modestly declined in the past two weeks. While it is unclear at this point how severely the economy will be impacted, we believe the strength with which Florida entered this crisis combined with the continued attraction of its low tax, pro-business policies position Florida well for a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers continued its recent trend of strong underlying growth, increasing by approximately 72,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's first quarter retails sales increased 3.3% year-over-year, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL's retail sales declined by 0.7% as customer growth was more than offset by a reduction in underlying usage per customer.  We continue to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on FPL's retail sales, which are heavily weighted to residential customers at more than 50%, and we have a very limited exposure to industrial load at less than 3%. Additionally, since approximately 40% of FPL's load is cooling related and therefore important for both comfort and building maintenance, we expect this demand driver to remain relatively stable, especially as we head into the warmer months of the year. Weather-normalized retail sales for the past four weeks are down approximately 2% relative to the prior two years, with increased residential sales partially offsetting declines in other classes; however, this underlying usage decline has been more than offset by strong weather with overall usage in the past four weeks increasing nearly 10% relative to the prior two-year average. While the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage cannot be known at this time, we continue to expect the flexibility provided by our reserve amortization mechanism to offset any fluctuation in retail sales or bad debt expense and support a regulatory ROE at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current agreement.  For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% year-over-year as customer growth and an increase in underlying usage per customer were largely offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2019. Over the last four weeks, Gulf Power's weather-normalized retail sales have declined approximately 9% versus the prior two-year average. Similar to FPL, over this period strong weather offset the decline in underlying usage and overall retail sales increased nearly 4% versus the prior two-year average. As a reminder, unlike FPL, Gulf Power does not have a reserve amortization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset the fluctuations in revenues or costs, so any variability will therefore have more impact to Gulf's earnings and ROE than on FPL. As we have often discussed, weather-normalization is imprecise and is particularly so when evaluating short periods of time. We are providing our assessment of the changes in load in an effort to be transparent, but caution that these should be considered as indicative and assessed together with the overall changes in usage. Additional details on retail sales at FPL and Gulf Power are included in the appendix of today's presentation. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $318 million or $0.65 per share and adjusted earnings of $529 million or $1.08 per share. This is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 or approximately 11% from last year's comparable quarter results. As a reminder, last year's first quarter results have been restated to reflect the results of our NextEra Energy transmission projects formerly reported in the corporate and other segment.  New investments, including more than 1,500 megawatts of new contracted wind and solar projects that were commissioned during 2019, added $0.08 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets also increased by $0.09 per share due to an improvement in wind resource and increased PTC volume from our re-powered wind projects. Fleet-wide wind resource was at 96%, the long term average, versus 91% during the first quarter of 2019. Also contributing favorably were NextEra Energy transmission, where contributions increased by $0.04 versus 2019, and our gas infrastructure business, including our existing pipeline which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year.  These favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business, which declined $0.02 versus the particularly strong first quarter last year. All other impacts reduced results by $0.10 per share, primarily as a result of increased interest expense reflecting continued growth in the business and share dilution. As Jim mentioned earlier, Energy Resources' development team had another strong quarter of origination. Since the last call, we have added 1,590 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog, including 600 megawatts of wind, 420 megawatts of solar, 457 megawatts of battery storage, and 113 megawatts of wind re-powering projects. With this quarter's backlog additions and with two and a half years remaining in the period, we are now well within the 2019 to 2022 renewables development ranges that we introduced in the middle of last year. At this early stage, we are tracking extremely well against the total development forecast for this period and our backlog continues to track against the assumptions supporting our previously announced financial expectations. For the post-2022 period, our backlog now includes wind, solar and storage projects totalling approximately 3,200 megawatts, placing us far ahead of our historical originations at this stage and further supporting Energy Resources' long-term growth visibility. Beyond renewables, we continue to work with our partners on Mountain Valley Pipeline and with the relevant agencies to resolve the issues related to MVP's biological opinion. We are encouraged by the tone of the oral arguments at the Supreme Court on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline's case related to its Appalachian Trail crossing authorization and remain hopeful that the Fourth Circuit Court's original decision will be overturned, resolving similar issues for MVP.  We are also evaluating the recent Montana federal court decision supporting to enjoin the Army Corps of Engineers from issuing permits under the Nationwide 12 program. We believe the ruling out of the court is incorrect and anticipate that the federal government will seek to fix the situation rapidly. Assuming a successful resolution along the currently expected timeline of all of these issues, we continue to target a full in-service date for the pipeline during 2020 and expect an overall project estimate of approximately $5.4 billion. Turning now to consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $421 million or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.17 billion and $2.38 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, NextEra Energy's current liquidity position is approximately $12 billion, ensuring that we are well positioned to execute on our strategic plans regardless of potential market disruptions. The financing that we have executed year-to-date represents a significant portion of our expected 2020 financing plan, and we remain confident about our ability to execute the financing plan for the balance of the year and beyond. In the near term, we have the positive cash balances helping to ensure ample liquidity as we execute on our current investment programs. Energy Resources currently has commitments for substantially all of its expected 2020 tax equity financings, which we expect to close as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year. The financial expectations which we extended last year through 2022 remain unchanged. We continue to expect that NextEra Energy's adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate to be in a range of 6% to 8% through 2021 off of the 2018 adjusted EPS of $7.70, plus the accretion of $0.15 and $0.20 in 2020 and 2021 respectively from the Florida acquisitions. For 2020, we continue to expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $8.70 to $9.20, and as Jim highlighted, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of this range. For 2022, we expect to grow adjusted EPS in a range of 6% to 8% off of the 2021 adjusted EPS, translating to a range of $10 to $10.75 per share. From 2018 to 2022, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. As Jim noted, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined. As we announced in February, the board of NextEra Energy approved an updated dividend policy for beyond 2020 which is expected to translate to a growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2022, off of a 2020 base. The board's approval to continue to grow our dividends per share in excess of our expected adjusted earnings per share growth rate is a reflection of the continued strength in earnings and operating cash flow growth at NextEra Energy, and we remain well positioned to support the dividend policy going forward.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $294 million and cash available for distribution, including all distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects in both periods, was $130 million, up 31% and more than 200% respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Including full contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners would have achieved CAFD growth of 187% versus 2019. Contributions from portfolio acquisitions and an improvement in wind resource were the principal drivers of growth. New projects added $54 million of adjusted EBITDA and $44 million of cash available for distributions.  For the NEP portfolio, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 89% in the first quarter of 2019. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project-level debt service primarily as a result of the retirement of the outstanding notes at our Genesis project and the receipt of higher year-over-year payco [ph] payments. The reduction in project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results are net of IDR fees since we consider these as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.555 per common unit, or $2.22 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth rate range. As Jim mentioned earlier, the transactions that NextEra Energy Partners executed in 2019 allowed it to enter 2020 well positioned to withstand the recent market turmoil.  During 2019, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $1.8 billion through three convertible equity portfolio financings. With low initial coupons, the convertible equity portfolio financings provide more cash to LP unit holders, which we expect will allow NextEra Energy Partners to acquire fewer assets to achieve the same level of future distribution growth and therefore also reduce future financing needs. The benefits of these financings are a large reason that NextEra Energy Partners now has the flexibility to execute on its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2022. At times of market stress, reduced future asset and financing needs are a tremendous advantage and help further improve NextEra Energy Partner's ability to execute on its long-term growth objectives.  As NextEra Energy Partners advanced towards its organic growth investments in 2019, it took steps to support the financing for these investment opportunities as well. Through the recapitalization of the Texas pipelines, a project finance facility related to the Meade pipeline expansion project, and its advance discussions for tax equity financing related to the two wind re-powerings, NextEra Energy Partners expects to finance these accretive investments through attractive sources of long-term capital.  Last year, NextEra Energy Partners also purchased all of the outstanding holding company and operating company notes at our Genesis project. Assuming favorable resolution for our PG&E related assets, about which we continue to remain confident, the cash flows from the Genesis project can support significant long-term financing capacity. Additionally, following PG&E's emergence from bankruptcy, we expect cash that is currently trapped at our Desert Sunlight 250 and 300 projects to be distributed.  As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $48 million of distributions have been restricted or withheld at the projects. The Genesis financing capacity and the release of the Desert Sunlight trapped cash are additional potential sources of capital and liquidity for NextEra Energy Partners.  Finally, over the last year NextEra Energy Partners' revolving credit facility was upsized by $500 million to $1.25 billion, and the term was extended out to 2025. This incremental liquidity further supports NextEra Energy Partners' financing position and provides flexibility in how NEP executes on its long-term growth objectives.  Prudent capital management is a hallmark of our approach to how we manage all of our businesses. As a result of the actions taken over the past year, we believe NextEra Energy Partners is particularly well positioned to achieve its long-term growth expectations.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners' expectations, which remain unchanged. Including full contributions to PG&E related projects, year-end 2020 run rate cash available for distribution is expected to be in a range of $560 million to $640 million, reflecting calendar year 2021 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2020. Excluding all contributions from the Desert Sunlight projects, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2020 run rate for CAFD to be in the range of $505 million to $585 million.  Year-end 2020 run rate adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $1.225 billion to $1.4 billion, which assumes full contributions from the projects related to PG&E as revenue is expected to continue to be recognized.  Similar to NextEra Energy, while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic, we continue to feel comfortable with these expectations. As a reminder, all of our expectations include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2019 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.14, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of fourth quarter 2020 distribution that is payable in February 2021 to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.46 per common unit. As I previously noted, NextEra Energy Partners now expects to be able to achieve its long-term distribution growth expectations without the need for additional asset acquisitions until 2022.  In summary and as Jim highlighted, we continue to believe that despite the ongoing challenges in the market and the economy, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to execute and maintain their excellent prospects for growth. We continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are focused on delivering shareholder value going forward. That concludes our prepared remarks, and with that we will open up the line for questions. Good morning Shahriar, I appreciate the question, and of course regulatory--you know, any sort of procedures and questions that we have in front of the regulators are top of mind to us, but as we've highlighted over the last couple of months and very typical with prior preparation, our focus for this year ahead of our potential filing at the beginning of next year is really preparation and laying a lot of groundwork. At this stage in April, we've got a lot of time between now and year-end and really into the beginning of next year to evaluate how things have changed and adapt accordingly.  But at this point, our team's focus is very much on the preparation, and we continue to progress well on that. Shahriar, we're very pleased with where we are. Obviously highlighted in the prepared remarks that we are now well within the range for the development expectations that we laid out last year, which at this stage in progression towards the end of 2022, we are very well positioned to execute on everything that we've laid out. More specifically in the last couple of weeks, as we also highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and the Energy Resources team have executed terrifically well and many, if not most of those contracts that we highlighted have been signed since the pandemic was starting to emerge and ultimately top of mind of our customers.  If you think about the backdrop of why that might be, renewables are the least cost form of generation and in many cases are far cheaper than the alternative form of generation that's continuing to operate very expensive and inefficient, coal and some nuclear facilities, and our customers will save their customers money when they turn those plants off and replace them with renewables. We would expect that as our customers focus on what's best for their customers, they will continue to want to build renewables into their portfolios and we're very well positioned to execute. Thank you. Yes, essentially Steve. There wouldn't be any need. Obviously we have the existing convertible equity portfolio financings and the convertible to debt that would potentially convert into equity, and it's later this year, but there's no new issuances required. We highlighted on the prepared remarks that we have significant liquidity far in excess of what we would need, particularly since we don't need acquisitions to meet those distribution growth targets until 2022. Yes Steve, as you well know, one of the things that we've been particularly attuned to over the last, call it 18 months, is that there is a lot of private infrastructure capital, and the evidence of that is apparent with the convertible equity portfolio financings that we've executed since that time. Since the--you know, I'll just call it the pandemic time frame, so in the last couple of months, there has continued to be a significant amount of inbound interest and continuing conversations with a number of those parties to provide capital to NEP in various forms, so we have not seen any changes in interest moving forward and continue to be very confident in our ability to leverage those type of capital resources as we move forward.  We're fortunate we're in a position that we don't need to do anything, as we highlighted, until 2022, but we of course will continue to be opportunistic, and to the extent that there are good opportunities for NEP that are attractive and accretive to NEP unit holders, we may well take advantage of that. Okay, let me start with the reserve amortization. We highlighted in the remarks that the balance is now at $744 million and we continue to have confidence that cost containment and all of the factors that are pluses and minuses to that reserve amortization balance will continue to be sufficient for us to operate under the settlement agreement through the end of 2021, so really no change to our expectations that we, again, would file a rate case in '21 for new rates effective in 2022. Reserve amortization has been, we think, a very constructive concept in Florida regulation, particularly FPL over a number of different settlement agreements and ultimately rate case outcomes, but it has come about from settlements, so it's not something you would assume that we will have going forward. But we think it has been very good for customers because it's been able to provide long term rate stability for them through a variety of conditions, including the one that we find ourselves in today. We are very pleased with the constructive nature of regulations that we have been operating on, and again particularly so for the benefit of customers. I was just going to add to that something about the--you know, one of the important reasons why we continue to be confident about our ability to reach our CODs, keep our projects on track and on budget, is really something we've highlighted for years now - our focus on our supply chain and developing relationships with our vendors, strategic partners in many cases. As we went into this year, knowing that it was a significant construction development year at all of our businesses, we had intense focus on our supply chain. We always do, but even more so this year with how complex and intertwined it may be with how many priorities and the deliverables we have. Entering into that posture and facing the circumstances we find ourselves in now positioned us well to manage through these. We pick top quality suppliers where we are a significant customer to them, and we've had many instances over the last couple of weeks where we've worked closely with them to ensure that our projects stay on track and on budget. I don't think that should be underestimated. Focusing on long term total cost of ownership and ability for our suppliers to deliver is really paying off well for us in this type of environment. Good morning Stephen. Yes Stephen, one of the things that we did, we put it in the appendix, Slide 25 if you have a chance to take a look at it, is to give you some sensitivities for the revenue impacts for a percentage--you know, 1% change in sales, also the breakdown of our composition of mix between residential, C&I--well, commercial, and then separately industrial. Obviously our load mix at FPL, which is the significant majority of the regulated load that we have in our business, is heavily weighted towards residential and small and medium commercial businesses. We have seen pick-up in residential, as we highlighted, and a slight down tick in commercial. But as I also highlighted in the prepared remarks, and very consistent with what we've said to you over a long period of time, our ability to dissect the impacts from weather versus underlying usage are pretty good over a long period of time, but in short discrete periods of time are more challenging, particularly when weather has a significant impact on load.  In these last couple of weeks since you would say that there have been significant impacts from pandemic, and officially the stay-at-home orders here in Florida were in effect, we've had very favorable weather, so it's hard for us to dissect it, so we erred on the side of providing you some sensitivities so that you can make an assessment on your own as to what you think might happen and what would that would be in terms of cash revenues at FPL.  Again, to put a finer point to it, remember with reserve amortization that results in negligible or no impact. To the extent that we have reserve amortization available to us on an earnings basis, this would be just a cash impact.  To give context for what happened in the last major disruption to load, which was the 2008 - 2009 recession, obviously everywhere but including here, of course, in Florida, that was about a 4% to 6.5% effect to overall load demand, and that was over the course of the year, and obviously we're midyear this year. That gives you some guideposts for how to think about it from the way that we've approached it so far. Thank you Stephen. Michael, it's certainly a positive. As we, I think, announced these re-pairing opportunities at or near the investor conference last year and have planned for it in terms of how we would finance it and have the tax equity lined up to be able to finance that going forward, so it's certainly a positive that will impact results for this year. It's about $25 million worth of CAFD or so, as we've previously highlighted, so certainly a contributor.  Also a contributor were the other acquisitions that NEP made last year, as well as the recapitalizations that we executed on. It's the confluence of acquisitions, both from Energy Resources as well as third parties, as well as the organic opportunities, so it's a three-for in this case. We haven't talked about additional re-powering opportunities with respect to NextEra Energy Partners. As we'd previously highlighted, from a re-powering opportunity we thought the opportunity was particularly strong through the end of 2020 to take advantage of the full 100% PTC re-upping. But actually this quarter, we're announcing some re-powering opportunities in 2021 that will take advantage of the 80% PTC, so it's a very positive opportunity for us. I'm sorry, Michael - how does LCOEs for renewables stack up against--? They definitely have come down, but you would hope that someone making a long-term planning decision will think about prices over a long period of time. As we highlighted for FPL's 10-year site plan and we looked at what the costs are that we're anticipating at Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power together, solar paired with battery storage are the least cost form of generation, and we've put all that pen to paper and included that in our 10-year site plan, and have now removed the two combined-cycle natural gas plants that we had previously in the forecast in the mid-2020s as a reflection of where we think costs are.  From our customer standpoint, again they operate in many different jurisdictions, in some cases wind will be particularly attractive, in some cases it's solar. But if you keep in context the dollar per megawatt hour costs that we've continued to provide, which with incentives are for wind, anywhere in the teens to very low 20s for wind, even in low wind resource areas, and then for solar in the [30-plus] megawatt hour with incentives, and then post incentives continue to be very attractive in that $20 to $30 and $30 to $40 megawatt hour range, so very cost competitive even with where we think the fuel complex pricing is. But also, remember that coal and some nuclear facilities are our primary comparisons, and that hasn't changed dramatically."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Shahriar, this is John. I may just add onto that. We are seeing just a terrific development environment in front of us, for all the reasons that Rebecca mentioned. The fact that we buy cheaper, we build cheaper, we operate cheaper, we have the best development skills in the industry, customers more than anything right now want confidence and certainty that a project is going to get built, so we are actually seeing more opportunities come our way. Given that we compete against a lot of small players in both solar and wind, access to capital and a balance sheet, which we have, are extremely important and are something that we plan to leverage to create even more opportunities going forward. So actually, the current environment has created a better environment for us. No drop-off, no slowdown. One of the things that we were able to add this year, or this quarter, was 600 megawatts to 2022 and beyond of wind, which is just a terrific head start, that we're only here in the first quarter of 2020, so just tons of time to continue to be able to work the wind development pipeline over the next four years, with PTC being essentially at 60% through 2024. Just a lot of demand, a lot of folks that own peakers, a lot of folks that own coal very aggressively looking at renewable as an option with ESG as a tailwind. Knowing that even if we are in a recessionary environment, being able to pivot to renewables not only brings a clean energy story but it also makes their economies more competitive and lowers bills for customers at a time they need it most, so that's what's really driving demand. Michael, this is John. One thing I would add to that is remember as oil prices have come down, rig counts have come down in the Permian, which means there's a lot less associated gas, which has really actually helped natural gas prices, and we've seen a bit of an uptick in natural gas prices, particularly recently. When we are out originating new renewables, we really have not seen competition from gas-fired units for that reason. They still remain kind of in that $30 to $40 a megawatt hour range versus wind, which is still in the teens in most parts of the country, and then solar in that mid-20 range. So very, very competitive when you look at renewables versus gas-fired generation. The last thing I would add is just peakers. Remember gas-fired peakers not only are targets for new renewables, but also for battery storage. Battery storage costs have come down such that--you know, we mentioned the large standalone storage build-out that we have, the billion dollars going in, in '21. There is a significant opportunity in almost every part of the country where batteries are now more economic than gas-fired peakers, even at today's natural gas prices. Sure. I think the first one would be supply chain, and Rebecca talked about that for a minute; but given the size of our spend across the complex, being right around north of $13 billion, we are almost always our suppliers' largest customer. If we're not, we're their second largest in the world. If there are minor disruptions that come up, we're able to pivot to other manufacturing facilities that that particular vendor may own, so we don't see the same impact that perhaps a smaller player, whether it's in wind and solar, would see. So while they may see supply chain disruptions, we don't, just given the size and the sophistication and the buying power that we have. That's the first one - supply chain is something that I would look at for other smaller players. The second one is access to capital. Again, we always get first dibs and first allocations on tax equity financing. In the script remarks, I think we already said we have all of our tax equity needs for 2020 fully allocated. That is not the case necessarily for smaller developers. Smaller developers might struggle, particularly to the extent that banks have less amount of taxable income, notwithstanding the five-year net operating loss carry-back that was passed, I think in the first or second federal restructuring, so we're very well positioned from a tax equity standpoint, whereas maybe smaller developers might not be. I think for those two reasons, it could create project M&A opportunities for us, where some of these smaller developers need a rescue plan because they're going to be running up against issues at the end of the year. I think they also--it's not only on execution in terms of meeting year-end CODs, where we don't see issues and we have the ability to navigate around them, but as customers now are looking for who to select to build renewables for them going forward, knowing that there's a PTC declining clock, there's an ITC declining clock, they want certainty. They want confidence that that developer is going to be around to be able to actually deliver, so in RFPs and just in customer interactions, we're starting to see that theme play out more and more.  We feel really good about our ability to execute and we feel very bullish about our origination activities going forward for those reasons, which might not be the case of what you would hear from a smaller developer for those reasons. I think probably a little bit of both. It depends on where they're sourcing from and which OEM that they're using. Some OEMs have more alternatives to parts of the country that are less--parts of the world that are less affected, but I think you're going to see disruptions on both wind and solar for smaller developers. We have always made selections around our OEM providers and around our panel providers which are pretty diverse - inverters, things of that nature that give us a lot of flexibility, but a smaller developer may be beholden to one particular OEM that might not have the same amount of flexibility or one supplier, given how small their build is, that might have a disruption without the ability to pivot to somebody else. You're welcome, Michael, thank you."

            "name": "James Robo",
            "content": "Thanks Matt, and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been personally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The country and the world are facing devastating impacts from the spread of the virus, and we remain resolutely focused on doing our part by continuing to deliver affordable and reliable power. Never before has it been more clear how critical electricity is to the world, and our team is laser focused on ensuring its uninterrupted delivery so first responders can help those in need, businesses can continue to operate where possible, governments can continue to function, and our customers can go about their daily lives to the greatest extent possible during these challenging times. As part of NextEra Energy's core commitment to do the right thing, at both FPL and Gulf Power we have taken steps to help customers face the challenges that the pandemic has created. Both utilities have suspended electric disconnections during this state of emergency to ensure our customers have continued access to power, regardless of their economic circumstances. Additionally, next month the typical FPL and Gulf Power residential customers will receive a one-time bill decrease of approximately 25% and 40% respectively as an accelerated flow-back of lower fuel costs.  The NextEra Energy companies and employees have also committed more than $4 million emergency assistance funds to provide critical support to the most vulnerable members of the community. Our hope is that these steps will help customers navigate this difficult and unsettling time and support a more rapid recovery for them and the Florida economy generally. We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this pandemic stronger than ever, and we'll continue to do our part to support that outcome. It is during challenging times like these that the culture of NextEra Energy shines through, a culture focused on leadership, accountability, a passion to be the best, and a focus on flawless execution. NextEra Energy's employees have exemplified these characteristics over the past several weeks. I am very proud of how they stepped up, once again confirming my belief that we have the best team in the industry and that our culture and our people are our most important asset. Despite their daily lives being disrupted by the ongoing effects of the pandemic, our employees focus on continuing to do their jobs and delivering essential resource for customers and our economy has been unwavering. I'd like to take a moment to thank all NextEra Energy employees for their continued focus, hard work, and execution during these challenging times. It is because of them that I've never been more confident in our ability to deliver on all our expectations to our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.  As we focus on execution, the safety of our employees and the community is always our number one priority. To ensure that our critical operations, including the grid within Florida and our generating facilities, particularly our nuclear sites continue to operate safely and remain available to serve our customers, we have instituted our pandemic plan, which was most recently updated last year and have taken aggressive measures to protect our employees.  We understand the critical role that electricity plays in the economy and the daily lives of Floridians, and FLP and Gulf Power remain steadfastly focused on meeting their commitments. As we face the challenges created by the pandemic, we are fortunate that preparedness and crisis planning are in our DNA. For nearly 70 years, we have had annual drills to prepare for disruptions to our business, and while the circumstances of this situation are unique, it is that preparation to deal with the unexpected that is allowing our company to continue to deliver for our customers through this challenging time. Over the past several months, NextEra Energy has continued to execute across the board. Our transmission and distribution systems continue to perform in line with a typical high reliability standards. The more than $5 billion that FPL has invested since 2006 to build a stronger and smarter grid allows us to leverage automation and manage the team D system remotely. That automation and its ability to limit human intervention has never been more important than today. Operations at all our generating facilities at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources have been modified to protect the health and safety of our employees, and the pandemic has not caused any meaningful impacts at this time. In addition to ensuring continued safe and reliable operations at our plants, our nuclear team also delivered outstanding performance during the recent refueling outages at St. Lucie and Point Beach. In fact, the Point Beach refueling outage was one of the shortest outages in our entire nuclear fleet in the past 20 years. The ongoing outages at Turkey Point and Seabrook also continue to progress well. One of our most important core values is our commitment to excellence in all that we do. Over a long period of time, we have invested significant time and effort in developing key strategic partnerships, particularly related to our supply chain, to help support our ability to execute during challenging times like these. Over the past several months, our key strategic partners have continued to deliver, highlighting the value of deep, long-lasting relationships with best-in-class companies. These deep relationships and our position as the industry leader give us confidence that our equipment deliveries should remain on track, even if others face supply issues over the coming months. Our engineering and construction team also continues to perform exceptionally well, keeping the largest construction program in NextEra Energy's history on schedule and on budget. NextEra Energy's financial performance for the first quarter reflects this strong operating performance across all our businesses, with adjusted EPS increasing more than 8% year-over-year.  Let me now turn to our strategic focus, which remains unchanged. At FPL and Gulf Power, our focus has been and will continue to be on delivering an outstanding value proposition of low bills, high reliability, outstanding customer service, and clean energy solutions for our customers. The value of FPL's smart capital investments that we've made over the past several decades has never been more clear. These investments, including FPL's highly efficient generation portfolio and a stronger and smarter grid are allowing FPL to continue efficiently delivering affordable, reliable, and clean energy to our customers. While we continue to monitor the situation, our capital investment program remains on track at FPL and Gulf Power. The investments that we are making today, including one of the world's largest solar expansions, are expected to provide meaningful customer benefits over the coming years. As we move toward the current challenges, it will be important that we continue to provide low cost reliable service to our customers to support their recovery. The flexibility provided by FPL's reserve immunization mechanism combined with our best-in-class operational cost effectiveness help position FPL to meet its financial commitments while making smart, long-term investments during this uncertain time. At Gulf Power, we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. Similar to FPL and Gulf Power, our strategic vision at Energy Resources remains unchanged and we believe the market opportunity for low cost renewables has never been greater. In times when consumers and businesses are dealing with the challenges of economic uncertainty, we expect our customers will help ease these impacts by lowering the cost of power to their customers through new, renewable generation.  Reflecting the strong customer demand for renewables, the Energy Resources team had another terrific quarter of origination, adding approximately 1,600 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call, including our first 600 megawatts of wind projects for 2022 and beyond. Most of this quarter's backlog additions were negotiated remotely while employees operated under stay-at-home orders. The ability to add nearly 1,600 megawatts despite these conditions is a testament to our strong customer relationships, pipeline, and development skills. Also included in these backlog additions are approximately 460 megawatts of battery storage projects, almost all of which will be added to existing solar sites to take advantage of the ITC and enhance the value of our existing projects for customers. With the significant recent growth in our battery storage backlog, we increasingly see storage as an important standalone business in its own right. NextEra Energy's battery storage investments in 2021 are now expected to exceed $1 billion, which we believe would be the largest ever annual battery storage investment by any power company in the world, and have a total gigawatt hour capacity that discharges enough electricity to power the entire of Rhode Island for four hours. This highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low-cost wind and solar energy with a low-cost battery storage solution. We continue to expect that by the middle of this decade, without incentives, new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal, nuclear and less efficient oil and gas biogeneration units. As a result, we expect that the long-term projections for wind and solar that we have previously shared will be achieved or exceeded over the coming decade, representing a tremendous growth opportunity for Energy Resources.  As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day today, we are proud of our track record of improving the environment particularly through the CO2 reductions that we have delivered as a result of our clean energy efforts across the country. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving very hard to continue to be at the forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector. To capitalize on this significant growth opportunity, Energy Resources expects to extend its long track record of excellence and execution. By leveraging our strong relationships with our equipment suppliers and contractors that I've previously mentioned and using the significant experience that we've developed over our more than 20 years in the renewable business, we've been able to keep our construction program on track despite the significant disruptions that are occurring both globally and locally. Energy Resources' 2020 wind turbine deliveries remain ahead of schedule, and we are not currently experiencing any significant equipment or labor issues at any of the more than 5,000 megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year. While we continue to monitor this situation closely, we expect that all of our planned 2020 renewable construction projects will achieve their in-service dates this year and believe that we will extend our track record of never having missed a PTC deadline on one of our wind projects.  Energy Resources' track record of execution has been a key competitive advantage over time. In periods of uncertainty like we are currently experiencing, we expect customers will increasingly want confidence in a company's ability to deliver on its commitments. Energy Resources' extensive experience, combined with our customer, supplier, contractor, and financing relationships all separate us from other developers during these challenging times. In addition, we expect that some of our competitors may falter as a result of these challenges, and we will look to leverage any opportunities that this may present. To support the execution of FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources' strategic objectives, over the past several months we have focused on ensuring NextEra Energy's continued strong access to capital. The strength of NextEra Energy's balance sheet and access to ample liquidity have always been and will always continue to be a core strategic focus for us. In times of financial market disruption like we've recently experienced, the value of balance sheet strength and access to liquidity have become even more apparent. We entered the year with meaningful cushion against our credit metrics and access to significant liquidity through the largest and most diversified bank group in our sector and maintenance of the industry's largest credit facilities.  In the middle of February, we issued $2.5 billion in equity units to add additional cushion against our credit metrics and further supplement our liquidity. Additionally, since the market disruption began, we have further improved our liquidity position with an additional roughly $4 billion in longer term financings, including $1.1 billion in FPL first mortgage bonds, $1.25 billion of capital holdings debentures, and an additional $1.8 billion in capital holdings term loans. Following these issuances, NextEra Energy now has approximately $12 billion in liquidity to help support the largest capital investment program in our history, and we plan to continue to be prudent in our financing plan going forward. In summary, NextEra Energy remains well positioned to continue to execute over both the near and long-term horizons. Over a long period of time, we have focused on building a business that is resilient and able to deliver for our customers and shareholders, regardless of the economic and market conditions. We remain laser focused on extending that track record today. Even throughout the greatest market dislocations last month, NextEra Energy maintained ongoing access to capital, which is a reflection of the strength of its balance sheet as well as the overall resilience of NextEra Energy's underlying businesses. FPL and Gulf Power operate in what we believe is one of the most constructive regulatory environments in the country. The strength of FPL and Gulf Power's balance sheets and capital structures combined with the constructive, stable and forward-thinking approach of Florida's regulatory environment and our long track record of execution should provide investors confidence that both companies will continue to be able to deliver for customers and perform well in a variety of economic environments. At Energy Resources, the portfolio is focused on long-term contracted clean energy projects with high credit quality customers, which we expect will be largely insulated from the changes in the underlying economy.  Despite the current economic challenges and as a result of the strength and diversity of NextEra Energy's underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2020, 2021 and 2022, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings and, most importantly, continuing to reliably deliver for our customers. While our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions, I have confidence in our ability to meet these expectations even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic.  Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. While the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty throughout the economy, NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives and its commitments. We do not currently expect any material financial or operational impacts as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, as a result of the actions that we took last year, including two significant acquisitions, the organic growth investments that are being executed and the steps taken to reduce its overall cost of capital, NextEra Energy Partners entered 2020 particularly well positioned. This favorable positioning is even more valuable during times of uncertainty like we are experiencing today.  The benefit of last year's execution is apparent in our first quarter results with adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution increasing roughly 30% and 200% respectively year-over-year. We expect to achieve NextEra Energy Partners' 2020 distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the mid-70% range, even after excluding cash distributions from our Desert Sunlight projects, highlighting the significant flexibility NEP has going forward. While we will continue to be opportunistic, the favorable position with which NextEra Energy Partners entered the year gives it the flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until 2022, one year later than we had previously disclosed.  NextEra Energy Partners' liquidity position also supports its flexibility in achieving its long-term growth objectives. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners maintained a net liquidity position, including cash on hand, of approximately $650 million. NextEra Energy Partners' only near-term debt maturity is a $300 million convertible debt issuance that matures in September of this year which may be converted to net units if the conversion price is achieved. Without any near-term acquisition needs and no other corporate level debt maturities until 2024, NextEra Energy Partners maintains significant liquidity to help achieve its objectives.  The steps that NextEra Energy Partners has executed in the past year, such as the upsize and extension of its revolving credit facility as well as the project recapitalizations that create significant project finance debt capacity within the NEP portfolio, give us confidence that sufficient liquidity will be maintained. We also expect that the diversification of financing alternatives that NEP has pursued since its IPO will provide flexibility and continued access to capital, regardless of potential disruption in the capital markets. By leveraging the significant private infrastructure capital that has a strong demand for high quality, long-term contracted clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners maintains an attractive additional financing source.  In summary, we believe NEP is well positioned to execute on accretive acquisitions for LP unit holders going forward. With the tremendous expected long-term renewables growth combined with the strength of NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio and continued access to low cost sources of capital, we believe NEP is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry. With access to Energy Resources' unparalleled portfolio of renewables projects that now totals roughly 25 gigawatts, including assigned backlog, as well as the ability to execute on third party acquisitions and organic growth opportunities, we have as much confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long-term future as we ever have had. We look forward to delivering on that potential over the coming years. In closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty throughout the economy, it has not changed the fundamental value proposition of NextEra Energy or NextEra Energy Partners. Over a long period of time, we've focused on building resilient companies that are able to deliver on all their commitments throughout market and economic cycles, and we entered the current period of disruption uniquely well positioned. Despite the ongoing challenges, the core strategic focus across all of our businesses remains unchanged, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our objectives going forward. I'll now turn the call over to Rebecca to review the first quarter results. So first of all, just to address Santee Cooper for a moment, Santee Cooper is by no means done. I think you all saw the speaker of the house sent a letter to Santee Cooper, calling them a rogue agency. The governor wants to sell them, so it's not done. The disagreements in the senate around what to do with Santee Cooper led to a bit of a standoff around the budget in the middle of the pandemic, and you can--you know, obviously it's a topic that is quite hotly debated in South Carolina. But I would say by no means is Santee Cooper done, and there remains a lot of energy still behind wanting to sell Santee Cooper. Just strategically overall from an M&A standpoint, I always like to just remind everyone always what our gating elements of anything that we would do. It has to make sense strategically, has to be significantly accretive. You all know how we finance these things historically - it's been with very little risk. I'm not a big believer in financing these things in a way that either takes risk or puts the balance sheet at risk. A strong credit rating is really critical to us and critical to our strategy, so all those things remain the same. I think what you're going to see in terms of the environment obviously is with the uncertainty in the financial markets and the uncertainty with the economy that's been driven by the pandemic, I think you're going to see counterparties take a pause. That's a natural reaction to the environment that we're in. But our strategic thinking around it remains unchanged and our approach to it remains unchanged, in that it has to be strategic, has to be accretive, has to be consistent with a very strong balance sheet. Steve, I think it could be quite meaningful. If you look back at '08 and '09, we had a lot of opportunities in that time where you had developers who didn't have great access to capital, and we were a source of capital for them.  I just want to reiterate something that John said. If anything, the renewable market is better right now that I ever expected it to be. I just got through with a review of our entire portfolio of projects and activity last week, and honestly I was really struck by the acceleration of activity that we're seeing, so it is full speed ahead on that front and I was very encouraged to see that. It was really, as we said in the prepared remarks, a real testament to the strength of our development team and the strength of our pipeline and the strength of our people and our relationships. Julien, I think it's premature to say what's going to happen with that. I think it's obviously a condition to--it being dealt with quickly is a condition to us being able to deliver the pipeline this year. We think the ruling was incorrect and we think government is going to aggressively try to correct it. That said, it's still early on. We haven't really gotten a lot of feedback yet from the government about what their approach is going to be, and we are continuing to evaluate it. I think it's early days, honestly Julien, is what I would say to you right now on that.  If our prepared remarks led you to believe that we had confidence that it's going to be done--that it's going to get resolved quickly, that was not what we were trying to say. We were trying to say that for us to build the pipeline this year, it needs to be resolved quickly, and it remains to be seen whether it will be. It's something that we as a team are very--along with our partners, are very focused on working with the government to get it resolved, and get it resolved quickly. Stephen, it's Jim. I think it's too early to tell. I think there is certainly some interest from the Democrats to include additional clean energy support in another stimulus bill potentially around--you know, with a focus on infrastructure. But as you've seen over the last several weeks, things are extraordinarily fluid in Washington, and I would just say it's too soon to tell. I think it's something as an industry that we need to be very thoughtful about in terms of how we approach it and have it be truly focused on stimulus and focused on the impacts of the pandemic, and make sure that that's the focus of any of the efforts that go on in the industry. You know, we're staying obviously very close to it and time will tell, but as I said, I think it's a little early and things are quite fluid."

With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Robo: Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had an outstanding year in 2021 and are well positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities that lie ahead. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we executed the largest capital program in our history, investing approximately $16 billion in American Energy infrastructure in 2021, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all industries. Continuing our long track record of delivering value for shareholders, NextEra Energy achieved full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, up more than 10% from 2020. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of approximately 9%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies, who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2021, we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index in terms of total shareholder return on a 3, 5, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and quadrupled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we've outperformed 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders, and we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years. At FPL, net income increased nearly 11% year-over-year while continuing to deliver on its commitment to making smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening our electric grid for the benefit of our customers. We were pleased the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement agreement in October, an agreement, which we believe is a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case. The 2021 settlement agreement supports continued smart capital investments, including the largest solar build-out by a utility in the U.S. while keeping FPL's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through the end of 2025. For customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next four years. Among the long-term infrastructure investments anticipated in the new agreement, new solar generation is expected to grow through the expanded SolarTogether community solar program, which is expected to more than double over the next four years, as well as through new base rate solar generation, including the nearly 1,800 megawatts to be recovered under solar base rate adjustments, or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations in 2024 and 2025. In total, our current solar build-out expectations are for approximately 4,800 megawatts of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement. In early 2019, FPL announced its ground-breaking goal to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. With the anticipated solar additions approved under the settlement agreement, I am pleased to announce that we now expect to reach this milestone by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. Including the solar additions anticipated through 2025, this ambitious 30-by-30 initiative is expected to have generated approximately $2.5 billion in fuel cost savings for customers and created more than 20,000 construction jobs, while supporting the Florida economy with more than $700 million in property taxes over the life of the assets. During 2021, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts of cost effective solar in service, completing the first roughly 1,500-megawatt phase of our SolarTogether community solar program. Additionally, last month we commissioned the world\u2019s largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will allow our customers to benefit from low-cost solar energy even during times when the sun is not shining. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021, and FPL was recognized for the sixth time in seven years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Moreover, FPL was ranked number one in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the southern U.S. amongst large electric providers by J.D. Power in 2021, and we are completely committed to continuing to provide clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2021, delivering adjusted earnings growth of 13% versus the prior year. The team also had an outstanding, record year of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts to our backlog during the year as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation\u2019s generation fleet. Our backlog additions have grown at a more than 20% compound annual growth rate since 2017, and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts. With the significant additions to our backlog of signed contracts over the last year, we've now signed nearly 80% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range with significant time remaining to sign additional power purchase agreements. Our supply chain and engineering and construction teams also continued to execute in 2021, commissioning approximately 3,800 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, solar and storage projects. Over the past two years, Energy Resources has constructed more than 9,500 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of its execution expertise even in the midst of a global pandemic and industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Finally, during 2021 NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution by increasing net income by nearly 20% over its previous earnings contribution record in 2020. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transition to a low-cost, low-carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. We anticipate that NextEra Energy Transmission will continue to capitalize on the growing opportunity set to both deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. The tremendous execution of both of the major businesses in recent years including 2021 gives us great visibility to the longer-term outlook of NextEra Energy. Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would not trade with anyone in our industry. At Florida Power & Light, the settlement agreement allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of our customers. Under the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8 and 9 percent over the four-year term through 2025. When you put it all together: low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are what help FPL provide, what we believe, is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation. At Energy Resources, our outlook for new renewables and storage development remains as strong as ever, and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old, inefficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable, low-cost renewables and storage. We believe that the rapidly accelerating trend toward electrification and decarbonization of a broad range of sectors across the U.S. economy has significantly increased the total addressable market for new renewables and storage even beyond our expectations just a few years ago and is now measured in trillions of dollars of capital investment opportunity in the coming decades. We believe that Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to advance its market leadership position in this environment. We have been in the renewables business for more than 30 years and have the experience, resources, balance sheet, talent and advanced data capabilities necessary to execute complex renewable energy generation and storage integration projects at scale. We believe we have an excellent opportunity set for continued growth ahead of us at Energy Resources, and we will further discuss our long-term plans for deploying renewables at both Energy Resources and Florida Power & Light and the associated impact to our overall emissions profile and future goals at our upcoming investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 14th in New York City. With the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. For years 2023 through 2025, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly 6 to 8 percent per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. For 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from our prior range of $2.77 to $2.97. Our new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33, and for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy\u2019s long-term growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 30% in 2021, bringing its two-year total unitholder return up to more than 72% and further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO in 2014. For 2021, the NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by 15% year-over-year and has now grown its distributions per unit by nearly 280% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve-month payout ratio of approximately 80% as of year-end 2021. NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year of execution in 2021 and we are increasing our year-end 2021 financial expectations to reflect this better-than-expected growth execution. NextEra Energy Partners delivered year-end run-rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in excess of our prior expectations, including delivering more than 13% year-over-year growth in run-rate cash available for distribution at the midpoints. This execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2021. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,900 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. In addition, during the year NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed two acquisitions of renewable energy assets from third parties, adding nearly 500 megawatts of operating wind projects to its portfolio. These transactions demonstrate NextEra Energy' ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources, low-cost sources of capital and our strong industry relationships to be successful in third party acquisitions. The combination of a growing portfolio at Energy Resources and a growing set of opportunities to acquire renewables from third parties, as well as significant organic growth opportunities, further supports the partnership's long-term growth visibility. NextEra Energy Partners also continue to demonstrate its ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth investments, including executing on the lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in its history. The roughly $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing carries a low implied cash coupon to the investor and partially funded NextEra Energy Partners acquisition of a 50% interest in a renewable portfolio, consisting of approximately 2,520 megawatts of newly constructed or in construction renewables projects and approximately 115 megawatts of integrated battery storage. NextEra Energy Partners was able to demonstrate the benefits to LP, unit holders of the convertible equity portfolio financing structure during the fourth quarter, when the partnership exercised its right to purchase 100% of the outstanding, minority equity interests in the portfolio of wind and solar assets supporting it's 2018, convertible equity portfolio financing. Relative to issuing the same amount of common equity in 2018 to fund our growth needs, this financing allowed us to reduce unit issuance by more than 50% and save more than $140 million or roughly 75% and nominal cash costs, while retaining the more than 80% increase in the NEP unit price over the last three years. NextEra Energy Partners public float has increased approximately 50% since 2019. We believe our strategy of using low-cost, convertible equity products to efficiently layer in common equity over time has created significant value for existing LP unit holders. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners clean energy, portfolio growth visibility and financing flexibility offers LP unit holders, a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unit holder value over the coming years. Finally, I'd like to comment on some important organizational changes that we announced this morning. These changes are part of a long-term succession process undertaken by the Board and me over the better part of the last six years. Effective, March 1 John Ketchum apprised me as President and CEO of NextEra Energy. Rebecca will succeed John as President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources; Kirk Crews currently Vice President of Business Management for NextEra Energy Resources will secede Rebecca as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy. John, Rebecca and Kirk will also be appointed to the respective roles at NextEra Energy Partners. In addition, Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company has been named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CEO for nearly ten years. I'm as excited as I have ever been about the future prospects of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. A big part of a CEO's legacy is the new leader in the next-generation leadership team that follows. And I couldn't be more thrilled about turning over the CEO role of this great company to John. I know he will be as focused on creating value for you, our owners, as I have been over the last two decades. John has been an incredible partner to me and a senior leader in this company for more than 19 years. And I can think of no better person to succeed me as CEO. John's breadth of experience across all aspects of our company, including commercial, operational, financial, and legal, as well as the significant leadership capabilities and vision, position him exceptionally well to lead NextEra Energy to even greater heights in the coming years. I also want to congratulate Rebecca, Eric and Kirk on their new roles. One of the defining characteristics of this company over the last 30 years has been the quality and strength of its leadership team, and I'm very proud of and excited for the team that will leave this company into the future. Most importantly, I want to thank my team and all our employees for all that they have done. Our team, the best in the business, has built this amazing company, and I can't thank them enough. As the announcement mentioned, I'm going to remain as Executive Chairman for a transition period to support John in his new role. I will now turn the call over to John, who would like to make some remarks.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I have been privileged to have worked with and learned from Jim during an incredible period of growth for our company. And I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this company in the years ahead. As CEO, I intend to remain intensely focused on delivering value for our shareholders and building upon our long track record of success. I believe there is no company better positioned to lead our country's energy transformation than NextEra Energy. And I am humbled by the opportunity to lead this team through such an exciting period for our company. I am fortunate to have a broad leadership team with the experience and capability that I, too, believe is the best in the industry. I am very excited to have Eric, Rebecca and Kirk take on these expanded and new roles in the company. They, along with our broader leadership team and all of our approximately 15,000 employees, work tirelessly every day to serve our customers in Florida and across North America. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to thank Jim for his exceptional leadership and friendship. Jim has been an unbelievable steward of this company over his nearly ten years as CEO, growing the leading, most profitable, electric utility and renewable energy company in North America. Our total shareholder return during Jim's tenure has been more than 500%, and it is great evidence of Jim's exceptional vision, leadership and commitment to excellence. I know I speak for all of our employees that we are deeply grateful for everything Jim has done for our company. Let me now turn it over to Rebecca for a more detailed review of our results.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $560 million or $0.28 per share, up $0.03 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2021, FPL reported net income of $2.94 billion or $1.49 per share, an increase of $0.14 per share versus 2020. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2021, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of nearly 11% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, net income was impacted by a number of factors, including an approximately $32 million pretax contribution to our charitable foundation that will allow it to continue to support the communities that we serve. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $137 million of reserved amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2021 balance of $460 million. As a reminder, our new four-year settlement agreement became effective this month, and includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, which is inclusive of $346 million in reserve amount that we previously anticipated to be remaining at year-end 2021 under FPL's now expired 2016 rate agreement. Consistent with the terms of the 2021 settlement agreement, half of the $114 million in excess reserve balance at year-end 2021 will be used to reduce our outstanding capital recovery asset balance. And the other half will increase FPL's storm reserve to offset future restoration costs. As a reminder, the new agreement limits reserve amortization to $200 million in 2022, which we will treat as a limitation in any given quarter during the year. Given the historical shape of our customer usage, we typically use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year and reverse reserve amortization in the hotter summer months. We currently expect FPL to initially earn below our target regulatory ROE in the early part of 2022. Although for the full year we are targeting the upper end of the allowed range of 9.7% to 11.7%. As a result, we also expect FPL's earnings growth to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Our overall capital program at Florida Power & Light is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and met our solar deployment objectives at both FPL and Gulf Power in 2021, including commissioning more than 800 megawatts of new solar across the combined system. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget, as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date later this year. The North Florida Resiliency Connection remains on track to be in service by mid-2022. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $60 million or $0.03 per share. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $271 million or $0.14 per share an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year. Base O&M reductions and investments in the business were the primary drivers of Gulf Power's approximately 14% year-over-year growth in net income. Gulf Power's capital expenditures for the full year were roughly $800 million, and it\u2019s reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.25% for the 12 months ending December 2021. Given that this is the last time we will be talking about Gulf Power's financial results, let me take a moment to summarize the team's execution over the past three years. Gulf Power has delivered significant improvements in all key financial and operational metrics, while meaningfully improving its customer value proposition. The execution of the NextEra Energy playbook at Gulf Power, which is focusing on reducing costs and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, has been a remarkable success. Gulf Power has realized a nearly 40% reduction in O&M costs since the acquisition. Since 2018, Gulf Power improved service reliability by nearly 60%, and was awarded national recognition for its outstanding reliability performance in the Southeast suburban and rural service area for the second year in a row in 2021. Over the same period, Gulf Power realized an approximately 60% improvement in safety among our employees who have worked tirelessly to help us execute on our plans. Regulatory capital employed has grown by approximately 16% compound annual growth rate since 2018. We have invested approximately $2.5 billion in long-term improvements to Gulf Power's existing system and generation fleet. As a result of our clean power modernization investments at Gulf Power, we have already delivered an approximately 25% reduction in CO2 emissions over the last three years, and we look forward to further expanding the opportunity for our customers to access clean, low-cost solar and storage in the years to come. This high level of performance across the board could not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the Gulf Power employees. And I would like to thank all of our Florida Power & Light employees, old and new, for their relentless focus on reducing costs while improving reliability and safety over the past three years. Execution of the plans that we laid out at Gulf Power has generated great outcomes for our shareholders as well. Gulf Power's net income has grown by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% since 2018, an outcome that was even better than our expectations when we announced the acquisition. Our performance with Gulf Power is a clear validation of our strategy and our conviction that you can be clean, reliable, affordable and profitable at the same time. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 5% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.2 trillion, which is up approximately 8% from pre-pandemic levels and would make Florida the 15th largest economy in the world. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. According to recent Census Bureau data, more people moved to Florida from other parts of the country than to any other state in 2021. We believe this is a reflection of Florida's unique proposition in terms of great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing customer growth at Florida Power & Light. Over the past year, Florida has created more than 485,000 new private sector jobs and Florida's labor force participation rate has improved significantly. Three months average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts are up 15% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 13%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including a 34% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a 2.6% decline in mortgage delinquencies while mortgage delinquencies across the U.S. have remained roughly flat. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 82,000 customers from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were down 1.5% versus the prior year period, driven by an unfavorable weather comparison. For 2021, FPL's retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by ongoing strong customer growth and a 1.5% year-over-year increase in underlying usage per customer. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income of $851 million or $0.43 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million or $0.21 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $599 million or $0.30 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.21 billion or $1.12 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.13 or approximately 13% versus 2020. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables and energy storage portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.12 per share. Contributions from existing generation and storage assets decreased $0.04 versus the prior year due primarily to underperformance in our existing wind fleet as a result of extreme market conditions in Texas in February of last year. NextEra Energy Transmission and Gas Infrastructure contributed favorably, increasing results by $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, year-over-year, while the contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses decreased $0.02 versus 2020; all of their impacts increased results by $0.04 year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, Energy Resources had an outstanding year delivering our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog. In 2021, we commissioned approximately 3,800 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects, including a 110-megawatt build-on transfer project that was not included in our backlog. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 1,500 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog; including approximately 700 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 300 megawatts of solar, and 500 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2021 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals, but perhaps more importantly allow our customers to save energy on \u2013 save money on energy costs, while switching to lower cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar-plus storage. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 6,600 megawatts, which is roughly the size of our entire renewable generation portfolio at the end of 2017, and nearly 25% larger than our backlog at year-end 2020. And this provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that lies ahead for Energy Resources over the next few years. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program and energy resources now stand. We remain optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources. We believe that there are many new market opportunities where our industry leading development platform will provide a competitive advantage to further grow our core long-term contractor of renewables and storage business. As we have previously discussed green hydrogen presents a particularly compelling new market for Energy Resources. During the fourth quarter a clean energy technology company in which we are a minority equity investor and that it has developed a proprietary process to decarbonize industrial production of hydrogen and economic prices. One, a conditional approval for an approximately $1 billion DOE, Department of Energy loan to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black product facilities in Nebraska. Our agreement with this company provides Energy Resources the opportunity to be its preferred renewable energy supplier for the facility and we are encouraged by the acceleration of the facilities build-out that is expected to occur as a result of this new loan. Similarly, early in the year we completed the strategic investment in a liquid fuels company with a proprietary process to produce zero emissions synthetic fuels by combining green hydrogen with concentrated carbon dioxide streams captured from industrial processes. Our strategic partnership with this company includes the opportunity for energy resources to provide up to 3,000 megawatts under a preferential energy supply agreement. Finally, as part of our efforts to help our commercial and industrial customers achieve their substantial goals for both energy savings and decarbonization we recently announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase that allows for use of our proprietary state-of-the-art smart energy software to optimize its energy use and reduce its carbon footprint. Energy Resources advanced software platform uses artificial intelligence and block-chain technology and leverages data from the industry leading renewables and storage fleet owned and operated by Energy Resources. Two, among other things match energy demand with clean energy resources available on the market in real time. We recently signed a similar agreement that allows a large university to use our advanced software platform to manage and optimize a more than 100-megawatt solar plus storage asset in California. Through these initiatives Energy Resources is leveraging its best-in-class renewable energy expertise to provide significant value to its customers in a market with meaningful growth potential. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets, while taking a leadership role in clean energy transition, expected to drive tremendous growth for Energy Resources over the next decade and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.2 billion or $0.61 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $814 million or $0.41 per share respectively. For the full year 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $3.57 billion or $1.81 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.02 billion or $2.55 per share. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.05 per share compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. Our fourth quarter refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $140 million. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contribution in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy successfully refinanced approximately $5.2 billion in existing debt and hybrid securities and proactively issued roughly $4.9 billion in replacement funding. This combination of redemptions and new issuance extended its maturity profile by over 6 years and is expected to generate an approximately $30 million after-tax reduction in annual interest expense in the near-term. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. During the fourth quarter, Energy Resources closed on its previously announced agreements to sell a portfolio of newly constructed and under construction renewable assets to NextEra Energy Partners and to a third-party infrastructure investor. Through the sale of this 2.5-gigawatt renewables portfolio, Energy Resources was able to recycle nearly $3.5 billion of capital, including the tax equity proceeds in accretive manner, and take advantage of the strong market for wind, solar and storage assets. We believe that our renewables development platform at Energy Resources is second to none, and our ability to continue to harness market demand for renewables and recognize the value of that platform is a key competitive advantage for NextEra Energy as it continues to grow its portfolio of long-term contracted operating renewables and storage assets at Energy Resources. Turning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy. As Jim discussed, today we are increasing the ranges of our adjusted EPS expectations for 2022 and 2023, and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, NextEra Energy now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off of the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges for each year. Details of our new financial expectations are included on the accompanying slide. From 2021 to 2025, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats. Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $322 million and cash available for distribution was $91 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to the growth in the underlying portfolio. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2020. In our existing projects portfolio, favorable performance from NextEra Energy Partners' natural gas pipeline investments and contributions from the wind repowerings that we added at the end of 2020 were partially offset by weaker wind resource and lower generation at our Genesis solar project as a result of outages for major maintenance in the first and fourth quarters of 2021. For the full year, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 100% in 2020. Cash available for distribution was $584 million for the full year. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower corporate level interest expense was partially offset by comparably higher project-level financing costs on our Genesis solar project and other existing assets that were recapitalized to fund the acquisition of approximately 500 net megawatts from Energy Resources at the end of 2020. Over the past three years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7075 per common unit, or $2.83 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2021. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners closed on the initial funding of its approximately $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Apollo Global Management and used those proceeds, along with existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity, to fund its acquisition of approximately 1,300 net megawatts of renewables and storage from Energy Resources. Under the terms of the agreement, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to benefit from a low implied initial cash coupon over the first ten years despite only providing approximately 4% of the upfront capital needed to purchase the assets, while we expect will allow NextEra Energy Partners to achieve a full return of its capital invested into this acquisition in less than two years. Additionally, the financing will provide NextEra Energy Partners the flexibility to periodically buy out the investor's equity interest between the five and ten-year anniversaries of the agreement at a fixed pre-tax return of approximately 5.6% inclusive of all prior distributions, making this NextEra Energy Partners' lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing to date. NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to pay up to 100% of the buyout price in NEP common units, issued at no discount to the then-current market price. NextEra Energy Partners also issued approximately 7.25 million new NEP common units during the fourth quarter to acquire the remaining equity interests in a portfolio of 1,388 megawatts of wind and solar assets associated with the convertible equity portfolio financing that NEP entered into in 2018. NextEra Energy Partners funded the remaining roughly $265 million of the approximately $885 million of total consideration for the acquisition of equity in the portfolio with project-level debt issued on a subset of the underlying assets. The nearly $650 million project financing supported by these assets, which was also the lowest-cost project-level debt financing in the partnership's history, is reflective of the strong performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio and also supported financing of other growth opportunities executed in 2021. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low-80% range. Given the successful execution of the recent acquisition from Energy Resources, as well as the approximately 100-megawatt operating wind facility from a third party, year-end December 31, 2021 run-rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution exceeded our previous expectations ranges. As a result, today we are introducing new year-end 2021 run-rate expectation ranges for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $1.635 billion to $1.795 billion and $640 million to $720 million, respectively. With the combination of strong cash flow generation from the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, including the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new renewables and storage added during 2021 and its relatively low payout ratio, NextEra Energy Partners has significant flexibility in terms of acquisitions in the coming year. Although acquisitions could occur at any time in 2022, for modeling purposes it may be practical to assume that any new unannounced asset additions occur late in 2022 and therefore have limited contributions to the calendar-year 2022 expectations implied by the year-end 2021 run rates for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution for the portfolio that we just discussed. NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2022 remain unchanged. Year-end 2022 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and CAFD in the range of $675 million to $765 million, respectively, reflecting calendar-year 2023 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. Florida Power & Light, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2021 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and, while we have a lot to execute on in 2022, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning team and thank you for the time and congratulations to everyone here. So many folks so well deserved. Indeed, Jim, we'll miss you, but we'll see you soon enough here, I'm sure.\nJim Robo: Thank you.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. If I can pivot here just to some of the core questions. First off, just impressive guidance. Can you talk about how you're thinking about BBB? I mean, maybe the way to ask this is a little bit in reverse. How do you think about BBB if that had actually happened here? What assumptions are you making out in 2025 on extensions or which frankly appear more likely than not eventually anyway? And perhaps more directly, how are you thinking about investments beyond wind and solar in those 2025 figures, for instance, storage or hydrogen, for instance?\nJim Robo: So Julien, let me take that. So we don't need BBB to deliver on the expectations that we've just laid out, right. I think about BBB as an accelerator, not as something that we would need in order to deliver on what we just laid out in terms of the earnings or the backlog growth that we've projected through 2024. In terms of how am I feeling about BBB, I would say two things? I am optimistic about something happening some point this year. And I would say that might \u2013 when I say optimistic, I would say more likely than not. I think I was \u2013 I think I felt more optimistic in the fourth quarter than I do now. I think that's just reality, but I do think it's more likely than not that the clean energy piece of BBB gets acted on this year. I do think it's going to take a while. And everything we have heard says there is particularly in the Senate, I think a desire for some process and process takes time, given the Senate rules. And my sense is that it's not going to be a first quarter event, it's going to be post that either a second quarter event or honestly, probably more likely sometime in the fourth quarter after the election.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. I got you there. Feel free to opine any more on the 2025 guidance. I know that it's probably preempting a little bit the June Analyst Day, regardless. And then maybe if I could pivot in brief, any thoughts or comments you'd like to share around some of the headlines pertaining to FPL here? I know there has been a lot of back and forth and perhaps there is a lot of context to provide there.\nJim Robo: Sure, Julien. I think on some of the Florida political headlines, I think what I'd like to say on that is pretty simple. When we got \u2013 when we received the report and those allegations that have been in the press, we conducted a very extensive and thorough investigation that included looking at company financial records. It includes looking at everyone who was named in its company e-mails also looking at their \u2013 they've all provided access to their personal e-mails and text to us as part of that investigation. And the bottom line is we found no evidence of any issues at all, any illegality or any wrongdoing on the part of FPL or any of its employees. And so, that's kind of the bottom line. And I feel very good about the investigation that we did, and I feel very good that there is no basis to any of these allegations. So I think that's probably all that we're going to say on that today. And I think Rebecca is going to talk about the 2025, your question on 2025.\nRebecca Kujawa: Julien, as you might appreciate, and I'm sure everyone does on the call, when we think about our ranges of expectations, particularly when we're talking about several years out, like you asked about specifically 2025, there are quite a number of variables that we consider in order to set those ranges. And in particular, for the comment that we provided that we'd be disappointed not to be at the high end of each of those ranges, including 2025. I would say the key parts that we think about, first on Florida Power & Light Company, we've got the outcome from the four year settlement agreement that is now the \u2013 how we expect to operate for the next couple of years, and that creates the opportunity to continue investing in the business and executing on the strategy that's been so successful for customers over quite a number of years looking back, so we can continue that for the next couple of years. And we believe that, that will enable us to grow rate base in the range of 8% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis, assuming all of the investments that were anticipated in the settlement agreement, ultimately, we're able to successfully bring into service. On the Energy Resources side, the biggest drivers are the ones that we've talked about and are laid out in the slide materials on Page 16. Looking at our development ranges for all of wind, solar, energy storage and wind repowering over this four year period from 2021 through 2024, which obviously would have the largest impact on what our earnings look like in 2025. As Jim highlighted, if there is change in regulatory or incentive structures, we would obviously factor that in the future. But that's not anticipated in these estimates, and we feel really good about how we're positioned to execute between now and then. We do have to execute a lot. We have to execute the energy resources, which I'm excited to take on that challenge. We have a lot to do to continue delivering like we have at Florida Power & Light, but I think we're in a great position to do so.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent team. Best of luck. See you soon.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats, Jim and John and everyone else. So maybe, Jim, could you just give us a little more color on what you are going to focus your time on as Executive Chair and how long you intend to likely be in that role?\nJim Robo: Sure, Steve. So I think my focus is going to be to help John with the transition and in particular, help John with the transition as it relates to the Board. You should think about my transition time in terms of months, not years. And that's probably all we're ready to say about it today. But my real focus is going to be on making John as successful as I know he will be.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. Second question, just on the kind of renewables development, maybe you could just talk a little bit to the trends that you're seeing there. It did seem like fourth quarter slowed versus the prior quarters in terms of backlog growth. And is there may be some kind of waiting to see what happens with folks on BBB in the market right now or anything else that you might want to highlight?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. Steve, I'll take this. This is John. First of all, we're coming off a record year with 7.3 gigawatts, had a strong fourth quarter, posting about 1,500 megawatts. What we are seeing in the market is continued strong demand, and that's coming from a number of different sources. It's not only coming from investor-owned utilities and munis and co-ops, but also C&I. As there's been a lot of rotation of capital into ESG funds, it's certainly getting investor attention and putting an impetus on companies to become sustainable. And so one of the things that we've spent a lot of time on over the last couple of years is our customer base and how do we market to a different customer base, not that the investor-owned utility and muni and co-op won't always be our core. It will be. But we're doing some things differently, too, around C&I., for example. Some of you might have seen the Optos release where JPMorgan is partnering with us on new software product, where we go in and we basically are able to calculate exactly what their energy footprint looks like today. How we can make it better, how we can take money out of the bill, how we can make it greener. That's just one example of some of the things that we're doing differently in terms of the ways that we approach the customer. And when I look at the pipeline that we have in place, the land positions, the interconnects, it's second to none. It's an area of certainly focus that we are continuing to build out. We'll talk a lot more about that at the Analyst Day. But we have the best sites, the best team, the best talent the best analytics and the normal competitive advantages of being able to manage the supply chain operate cheaper, finance cheaper, all those things come together, give us a lot of optimism about the future.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. And then one last question, just on the guidance improvement. If I had to kind of simplify kind of what's driving the higher guidance, 2022 and beyond in terms of factors? Any just kind of key reasons you would say for the higher guidance?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, I'll take that as well, Steve. I think Rebecca covered certainly the FPL piece. And then you think about Energy Resources. We've doubled the backlog in the last few years; continue to see a lot of promise there with or without build back better. Jim said, more likely than not that we're able to get something passed there by the end of the year. But we plan our business as if it doesn't happen. And our financial forecast is based on it not happening. And that's why we were very resolute in our ability to take our expectations up not only for 2022, but to extend the guidance out through 2025. And that's just based on what we see in our renewable backlog. And when you think about the expectations that we laid out for investors for 2021 and 2022, I think, we've done a terrific job of meeting those and then laying out 2023 and 2024. We've made tremendous headway against those expectations.\nSteve Fleishman: Great, thank you.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Okay good morning, guys.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Congrats, Jim, John, Rebecca and team on the moves, well deserved. Just most of my questions actually just got answered. But just a quick question on near ventures. Obviously, you guys are starting to expand the playbook into CCS. Water, wastewater treatment. And obviously, in the prepared remarks, you just highlighted the hydrogen value chain opportunities there. Is the future growth of any of these type of investments more specifically predicated on any outcomes of federal policy like a hydrogen PTC? And seeing sort of the lack of progress on that front, do you anticipate any pullback from these sort of opportunities? Not the base business, not the base newer opportunities, but more specifically on the venture side.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Shar. And I appreciate the question. We do think there's a lot of opportunities as I talked about in the prepared remarks, not only of purely executing our renewables for the electricity sector, but helping use clean energy to decarbonize these other industries. And we're thinking about some of these investment opportunities as a way to explore how those business models and investment opportunities are ultimately going to shape up over time. But to answer your direct question around the incentives, the investments we've made to date do not assume that there's a change of incentives or even the specific question around hydrogen that there's a hydrogen PTC. But as John and his team, the Energy Resources team has evaluated a number of hydrogen pilot opportunities or future business opportunities. They certainly would be furthered and helped. Some of them would be by hydrogen PTC. And that's one of the things that I know we, as a whole team remain optimistic about that if something happens, whether it's the full BBB or just a climate title that happens through reconciliation, we're optimistic that a hydrogen incentive would be included in that package. I think there's a lot of opportunities to further the decarbonization of the U.S. economy through the use of hydrogen. So short answer, investments don't assume it, but I think there's even more opportunity if there are some incentives like the hydrogen PTC in the future.\nShar Pourreza: And then let me ask you, just, obviously, the opportunity is sort of that, especially as you're thinking about on the hydrogen side. As sort of the growth starts to transpire, how are you sort of thinking about credit metrics? Any potential pressures there as that business grows? And how we should be thinking about equity funding on those?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes. One of the strategic imperatives, the way that we think about managing the business over the long-term, and I highlighted a couple of times in remarks and we highlighted on a consistent basis because it's a high priority for us is maintaining that strong balance sheet. As you've seen, quality of credit degrade elsewhere in the industry, we have remained as committed as ever to maintaining that strong balance sheet. We think it's a huge differentiator for us and being able to execute our business to deploy the capital that we deploy and to provide the stability that our customers assume and expect from us, we think a strong balance sheet is imperative. So, as we think about all of these investment opportunities, the growth in our business, that will remain a priority, and we will assume that as part of the way that we're thinking about the business as a private facia part of the strategy.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks again I\u2019ll pass it to someone else. And again, big congrats John and no surprises here. Thanks.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Boyd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead\nSteven Boyd: Hey good morning. I just want to echo congratulations to Jim, and to John and Rebecca, and Kirk and Eric. The performance you all have achieved is really quite remarkable. So, congrats are absolutely in order. So just so happy for you all. I wanted to spend a little time on the technology side. I guess it strikes me that within NextEra for years; you've all been developing a variety of interesting technologies, sometimes not always as visible to us. But it just strikes me that some of those developments are becoming both more visible and potentially more commercial, more of interest in terms of ways you can monetize that to a fairly broad customer base. And then just curious, I know this is a high-level question, but just interested in your take on how important technology such as some of the software development that you all mentioned could be to driving earnings power to driving growth of NextEra in the long-term?\nJessica Aldridge: Yes, Stephen, thank you for the question. And I think you're absolutely right. It's probably something that we have not talked about very much, and probably will talk about more going forward. The reason why we had not talked about it a lot in the past is we really have thought about it as a strategic advantage to us, which we continue to believe a strategic advantage to us. And we've largely used as a way to further both the profitability and the win rates on developing renewables. As we thought about how does the business grow and change and we capitalize all of these opportunities that you and we and the industry see, one of the shifts is thinking about our commercial and industrial customers, whether they are traditional C&I customers that have been interested in the products that we sell or new ones, or ones that, or more industrial in nature, agricultural in nature, they often need some additional services to help them understand how to manage their generation and load needs, think about their carbon intensity, deliver on their own environmental, social and governance goals. And some of the things that we've developed internally through all of our expertise are very appropriate and enormously valuable to these customers. So, we've seen the opportunity to continue these investments, think about how we package and sell them to customers, and you'll see a lot more of that from us going forward. And we think there's a huge opportunity to sell not only those services, but also use them as a way to deepen our relationships with our customers and ultimately deploy renewables over time.\nSteven Boyd: That's really helpful Rebecca. And would that be essentially upside to the plan, in other words, sort of beyond the typical kind of numbers we see around renewables deployment, et cetera? Is this an area of upside? Or have you factored some of this into thinking about your growth?\nRebecca Kujawa: I think for base assumptions, we're including some assumptions around what we think we can do with these types of businesses. But as always, there's pluses and minuses. Fortunately, for us, they've largely been pluses in recent history, and we've been able to deliver adjusted EPS growth in excess of even what we, they have anticipated or laid out for investors prior to delivering. So hopefully, we'll be in a position to do that again over time. But for now, I think you should safely assume that our expectations are the ones we just laid out in the last couple of minutes. And we'll use all of these levers to deliver against those and again, hopefully achieve as we expect the high end of each of these ranges, which we would feel very proud of and see as enormously value accretive to shareholders.\nSteven Boyd: Okay, I agree. Maybe just one last one for me. We're often asked about impediments to growth in clean energy and pretty clearly, NextEra is not experiencing that. Just curious if you could talk a little bit more about just sort of some of those impediments sort of perception versus reality, things like supply chain, labor availability, permitting, anything else? Just sort of \u2013 I think there, frankly, is sometimes a misconception about those limits to growth. And it looks like clean energy growth remains very strong, especially for NextEra. But just curious if you could just comment on those perceptions of limits on growth.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, let me take that one. I think you identified some of the obvious ones that we have that we are addressing, certainly, supply chain and those types of issues, and I think we've answered those. I think when I look at the market today, Stephen, the issue for companies to be successful or not successful; the biggest differentiator is going to be many of the questions that you just asked. And are you positioning your company for what is going to be a more complex energy offering that is going to be demanded by the customer? Rebecca gave the example of a C&I customer. It's not as simple as being able to approach a C&I customer and say, \"Hey, I'm going to sell you 100 megawatts of wind or 100 megawatts of solar or what do you think about a 50-megawatt battery?\" These are people that are selling candy bars, and bottles of water and things of that nature. They are not in our business. They need the expertise as to how they think about that addition within their existing energy needs. And so, it takes a comprehensive skill set in order to come forward with a clean energy solution that makes sense for that business. And so, when you think about a lot of the small developers that we have to compete against in solar and wind, they don't have that expertise. They don't have the ability to offer firm and shape products and things that it's going to take to really win the business. That's the first piece. The second piece is the question you asked around technology. We have been very aggressive in our investment around technology. We've talked about the NextEra Energy analytics team that we bought back in 2005. We have really built that team out. It's a group of PhD, mathematicians, software developers, software engineers, that not only use those tools to help manage our existing fleet and help leverage and drive operating efficiencies around what we do every day in managing our existing footprint, but they're now able to take all that data, all that information, all that know-how to develop comprehensive software solutions for customers. And that is a huge leg up that we have over the rest of the industry, and one of the things that we're looking at. And the third thing is renewable enablers. We are really looking at what it means to lead the energy transition. What are you going to have to be good at? And what capabilities are you going to have to have as an organization to really do that. And we have been spending the last three or four years, very focused on it. We don't talk a lot about some of the things that we're up to. You'll get more details at the Analyst Day, but needless to say and be self-assured, we're ready.\nStephen Byrd: That's great of you. Thank you so much.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Stephen.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hi guys. Thank you and congrats to everyone on all the leadership changes. I actually have two questions on the regulated business in Florida. First of all, can you just remind us, and I know you'll give us more detail six months from now. But just can you remind us what the capital spend levels for the next couple of years are, combined FP&L and gold or if you want to break it out and separate those, too?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, it's probably about $7 billion to $8 billion per year. It's included, Michael, in the regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 8% to 9% per year.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. $7 billion, $8 billion per year, and kind of flat? Or do you see that escalating over time? And how should we think about what percent of that capital is either recovered as part of the rate case revenue requirement increase or via the tracker? And what part may \u2013 would build up as rate base and you get it back in a future case?\nRebecca Kujawa: There's a mix, of course, Michael, as you might expect and we certainly have our best laid plans that will include as part of the updated CapEx tables in the 10-K when we publish it in a couple of weeks. One comment on that, I would make and obviously there's a difference between, as you recall, from the CapEx table for FPL versus Energy Resources. But in both cases, as you get closer to that operating year, the teams tend to find good investment opportunities that are value accretive from a customer standpoint and may add and subtract to those over time. But those will be our best estimates based on what we've seen so far and also under the parameters of the settlement agreement inclusive of the SolarTogether investments that were approved as part of the settlement agreement. And also anticipate the current views around the investments on both storm hardening and undergrounding that, as you know, are included in a clause mechanism and recovered separately and approved separately over time. Those change over time depending on what we see and where we see the value coming for our customers, but we feel very good about the overall views. And of course, we'll give more details as we go into the investor conference in June.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And Rebecca, I just want to come back to some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks about FP&L and earnings targets for next year and beyond. Is it getting harder operationally, just given the size and the amount of capital you're deploying at FP&L, to hit the highest end or the top end of the earnings band? You're laying \u2013 historically, if you kind of go back and skim the transcript, always kind of talk about hitting that high end and it almost seems, and I may be misinterpreting, but the language today was kind of towards the high end, but maybe not exactly added. And I was just curious if there's a change there in terms of being able to hit the 11.7% level?\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. Let me answer the \u2013 I don't know if you're asking full on the NextEra Energy side where we typically have the language would be disappointed not to be at or near the high end. That language is exactly the same. And if anything changes solely a stumble on my part in terms of speaking, but the language is exactly the same. If you're asking specifically around Florida Power & Light Company, the approved range, as you know, for the settlement agreement is the range of 9.7% to 11.7%. And my comment was specifically around our expectations for 2022, which, of course, is the first year of the new settlement agreement. And that also includes the one-year limitation that was included in the settlement agreement around the use of surplus amortization just in this year, which is a maximum amount of $200 million. When we think about everything, what our investment plans are, our opportunities for continuing to focus on cost improvements, other improvements for customers, the investments that we plan to make, and the use of the surplus amortization, including the shape over time. We believe that at the end of the year we'll be able to report a regulatory ROE at the high end of the range. Where exactly that is, of course, we'll refine it over the \u2013 as the year progresses. And then, of course, we'll be targeting the high end of the ROE range in future years as well.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, Rebecca. Appreciate for taking the time and congrats again.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you so much, Michael.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: You covered a lot of ground today. Just one question for me and it's kind of been touched on a few different times, but just diving in with the transition, in general. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit more about why now is the right time versus any point in the past or in the future to make the transition. And then should we expect anything new in messaging from NextEra with the transition here? Could we expect something kind of new along these lines at the Analyst Day?\nJim Robo: So Jeremy, this is Jim, on the transition. I think you heard in the prepared remarks, this is something that the Board and I have been working on really in earnest since \u2013 well, honestly, in earnest, since my first succession planning discussion as CEO back in 2012. But I let the Board know that my target for retiring as CEO was after \u2013 I let them know this in 2016, honestly, that my target was after the 2020 rate case. And I actually extended kind of my time line a bit to get through this rate case. And so that's been \u2013 it's been my plan for a very long time. Obviously, we didn't make any decisions about it until we announced it here. But it's been something that the Board and I have been discussing for a very long time and we've been very deliberate about the succession planning that we've done, and I'm really pleased with the team that's going to be leading the company into the future.\nRebecca Kujawa: And I think, Jeremy, you had a second question going into the investor conference. Can you remind me what that was?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes. Just thank you for that Jim, that's very helpful details there. And just as we look at the Analyst Day here, should we expect kind of with the transition, any kind of change that might materialize in messaging at that point at the Analyst Day? Or that's not really the expectation at this point?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. For the Analyst Day, first of all we have never been in a better position. We're coming off of what I would characterize as our best year as a company. And it's been really a testament to the entire lead team, not only obviously the job Jim's done, but the job Eric's done, the job Rebecca's done and the leadership team that we have in place at Energy Resources. We have an extremely deep bench with a ton of experience. I've been here almost two decades. Eric's been here almost two decades. Rebecca has been here 15 years. And we have just a wealth of experience in the team that will bring full bear on the opportunity set that we have that we have going forward. And the way I think about it is we will continue to double down on the core. That means execution. Like \u2013 unlike what we've seen in the past around FPL and the capital plan that they have for customers and for shareholders, the renewable opportunity that we have in this country. Don't forget renewables are cheap; they're the cheapest form of generation in this country with or without incentive. So we have a tremendous opportunity there as well. And then the third piece I would characterize as the renewable enablers. What are the other things that we can do as a company that we've been working on behind the scenes that will help position us to be the leader of the energy transition in this country, and we're going to deal with the best team in the industry. So that's really what you're going to hear about at the Analyst Day.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $560 million or $0.28 per share, up $0.03 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2021, FPL reported net income of $2.94 billion or $1.49 per share, an increase of $0.14 per share versus 2020. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2021, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of nearly 11% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, net income was impacted by a number of factors, including an approximately $32 million pretax contribution to our charitable foundation that will allow it to continue to support the communities that we serve. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $137 million of reserved amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2021 balance of $460 million. As a reminder, our new four-year settlement agreement became effective this month, and includes the flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus, which is inclusive of $346 million in reserve amount that we previously anticipated to be remaining at year-end 2021 under FPL's now expired 2016 rate agreement. Consistent with the terms of the 2021 settlement agreement, half of the $114 million in excess reserve balance at year-end 2021 will be used to reduce our outstanding capital recovery asset balance. And the other half will increase FPL's storm reserve to offset future restoration costs. As a reminder, the new agreement limits reserve amortization to $200 million in 2022, which we will treat as a limitation in any given quarter during the year. Given the historical shape of our customer usage, we typically use more reserve amortization in the first half of the year and reverse reserve amortization in the hotter summer months. We currently expect FPL to initially earn below our target regulatory ROE in the early part of 2022. Although for the full year we are targeting the upper end of the allowed range of 9.7% to 11.7%. As a result, we also expect FPL's earnings growth to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Our overall capital program at Florida Power & Light is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and met our solar deployment objectives at both FPL and Gulf Power in 2021, including commissioning more than 800 megawatts of new solar across the combined system. Beyond solar, construction on the highly efficient roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget, as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date later this year. The North Florida Resiliency Connection remains on track to be in service by mid-2022. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $60 million or $0.03 per share. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $271 million or $0.14 per share an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year. Base O&M reductions and investments in the business were the primary drivers of Gulf Power's approximately 14% year-over-year growth in net income. Gulf Power's capital expenditures for the full year were roughly $800 million, and it's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.25% for the 12 months ending December 2021. Given that this is the last time we will be talking about Gulf Power's financial results, let me take a moment to summarize the team's execution over the past three years. Gulf Power has delivered significant improvements in all key financial and operational metrics, while meaningfully improving its customer value proposition. The execution of the NextEra Energy playbook at Gulf Power, which is focusing on reducing costs and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, has been a remarkable success. Gulf Power has realized a nearly 40% reduction in O&M costs since the acquisition. Since 2018, Gulf Power improved service reliability by nearly 60%, and was awarded national recognition for its outstanding reliability performance in the Southeast suburban and rural service area for the second year in a row in 2021. Over the same period, Gulf Power realized an approximately 60% improvement in safety among our employees who have worked tirelessly to help us execute on our plans. Regulatory capital employed has grown by approximately 16% compound annual growth rate since 2018. We have invested approximately $2.5 billion in long-term improvements to Gulf Power's existing system and generation fleet. As a result of our clean power modernization investments at Gulf Power, we have already delivered an approximately 25% reduction in CO2 emissions over the last three years, and we look forward to further expanding the opportunity for our customers to access clean, low-cost solar and storage in the years to come. This high level of performance across the board could not have been possible without the hard work and commitment of all of the Gulf Power employees. And I would like to thank all of our Florida Power & Light employees, old and new, for their relentless focus on reducing costs while improving reliability and safety over the past three years. Execution of the plans that we laid out at Gulf Power has generated great outcomes for our shareholders as well. Gulf Power's net income has grown by a compound annual growth rate of approximately 19% since 2018, an outcome that was even better than our expectations when we announced the acquisition. Our performance with Gulf Power is a clear validation of our strategy and our conviction that you can be clean, reliable, affordable and profitable at the same time. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 5% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.2 trillion, which is up approximately 8% from pre-pandemic levels and would make Florida the 15th largest economy in the world. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. According to recent Census Bureau data, more people moved to Florida from other parts of the country than to any other state in 2021. We believe this is a reflection of Florida's unique proposition in terms of great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing customer growth at Florida Power & Light. Over the past year, Florida has created more than 485,000 new private sector jobs and Florida's labor force participation rate has improved significantly. Three months average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts are up 15% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 13%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior year, including a 34% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a 2.6% decline in mortgage delinquencies while mortgage delinquencies across the U.S. have remained roughly flat. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 82,000 customers from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were down 1.5% versus the prior year period, driven by an unfavorable weather comparison. For 2021, FPL's retail sales increased 1.7% from the prior year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by ongoing strong customer growth and a 1.5% year-over-year increase in underlying usage per customer. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2021 GAAP net income of $851 million or $0.43 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $414 million or $0.21 per share. Energy Resources contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $599 million or $0.30 per share and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.21 billion or $1.12 per share. Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.13 or approximately 13% versus 2020. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables and energy storage portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.12 per share. Contributions from existing generation and storage assets decreased $0.04 versus the prior year due primarily to underperformance in our existing wind fleet as a result of extreme market conditions in Texas in February of last year. NextEra Energy Transmission and Gas Infrastructure contributed favorably, increasing results by $0.01 and $0.02, respectively, year-over-year, while the contribution from our customer supply and trading businesses decreased $0.02 versus 2020; all of their impacts increased results by $0.04 year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, Energy Resources had an outstanding year delivering our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog. In 2021, we commissioned approximately 3,800 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects, including a 110-megawatt build-on transfer project that was not included in our backlog. In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 1,500 megawatts of renewable projects to our backlog; including approximately 700 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 300 megawatts of solar, and 500 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2021 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals, but perhaps more importantly allow our customers to save energy on \u2013 save money on energy costs, while switching to lower cost forms of generation like wind, solar and solar-plus storage. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 6,600 megawatts, which is roughly the size of our entire renewable generation portfolio at the end of 2017, and nearly 25% larger than our backlog at year-end 2020. And this provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that lies ahead for Energy Resources over the next few years. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program and energy resources now stand. We remain optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources. We believe that there are many new market opportunities where our industry leading development platform will provide a competitive advantage to further grow our core long-term contractor of renewables and storage business. As we have previously discussed green hydrogen presents a particularly compelling new market for Energy Resources. During the fourth quarter a clean energy technology company in which we are a minority equity investor and that it has developed a proprietary process to decarbonize industrial production of hydrogen and economic prices. One, a conditional approval for an approximately $1 billion DOE, Department of Energy loan to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black product facilities in Nebraska. Our agreement with this company provides Energy Resources the opportunity to be its preferred renewable energy supplier for the facility and we are encouraged by the acceleration of the facilities build-out that is expected to occur as a result of this new loan. Similarly, early in the year we completed the strategic investment in a liquid fuels company with a proprietary process to produce zero emissions synthetic fuels by combining green hydrogen with concentrated carbon dioxide streams captured from industrial processes. Our strategic partnership with this company includes the opportunity for energy resources to provide up to 3,000 megawatts under a preferential energy supply agreement. Finally, as part of our efforts to help our commercial and industrial customers achieve their substantial goals for both energy savings and decarbonization we recently announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase that allows for use of our proprietary state-of-the-art smart energy software to optimize its energy use and reduce its carbon footprint. Energy Resources advanced software platform uses artificial intelligence and block-chain technology and leverages data from the industry leading renewables and storage fleet owned and operated by Energy Resources. Two, among other things match energy demand with clean energy resources available on the market in real time. We recently signed a similar agreement that allows a large university to use our advanced software platform to manage and optimize a more than 100-megawatt solar plus storage asset in California. Through these initiatives Energy Resources is leveraging its best-in-class renewable energy expertise to provide significant value to its customers in a market with meaningful growth potential. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets, while taking a leadership role in clean energy transition, expected to drive tremendous growth for Energy Resources over the next decade and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.2 billion or $0.61 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $814 million or $0.41 per share respectively. For the full year 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $3.57 billion or $1.81 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.02 billion or $2.55 per share. For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.05 per share compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. Our fourth quarter refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $140 million. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contribution in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy successfully refinanced approximately $5.2 billion in existing debt and hybrid securities and proactively issued roughly $4.9 billion in replacement funding. This combination of redemptions and new issuance extended its maturity profile by over 6 years and is expected to generate an approximately $30 million after-tax reduction in annual interest expense in the near-term. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing plan as we continue to execute on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. During the fourth quarter, Energy Resources closed on its previously announced agreements to sell a portfolio of newly constructed and under construction renewable assets to NextEra Energy Partners and to a third-party infrastructure investor. Through the sale of this 2.5-gigawatt renewables portfolio, Energy Resources was able to recycle nearly $3.5 billion of capital, including the tax equity proceeds in accretive manner, and take advantage of the strong market for wind, solar and storage assets. We believe that our renewables development platform at Energy Resources is second to none, and our ability to continue to harness market demand for renewables and recognize the value of that platform is a key competitive advantage for NextEra Energy as it continues to grow its portfolio of long-term contracted operating renewables and storage assets at Energy Resources. Turning now to our financial expectations for NextEra Energy. As Jim discussed, today we are increasing the ranges of our adjusted EPS expectations for 2022 and 2023, and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, NextEra Energy now expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off of the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges for each year. Details of our new financial expectations are included on the accompanying slide. From 2021 to 2025, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats. Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $322 million and cash available for distribution was $91 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to the growth in the underlying portfolio. For the full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA was $1.36 billion, up 8% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2020. In our existing projects portfolio, favorable performance from NextEra Energy Partners' natural gas pipeline investments and contributions from the wind repowerings that we added at the end of 2020 were partially offset by weaker wind resource and lower generation at our Genesis solar project as a result of outages for major maintenance in the first and fourth quarters of 2021. For the full year, wind resource was 98% of the long-term average versus 100% in 2020. Cash available for distribution was $584 million for the full year. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower corporate level interest expense was partially offset by comparably higher project-level financing costs on our Genesis solar project and other existing assets that were recapitalized to fund the acquisition of approximately 500 net megawatts from Energy Resources at the end of 2020. Over the past three years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7075 per common unit, or $2.83 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2021. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners closed on the initial funding of its approximately $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing with Apollo Global Management and used those proceeds, along with existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity, to fund its acquisition of approximately 1,300 net megawatts of renewables and storage from Energy Resources. Under the terms of the agreement, NextEra Energy Partners is expected to benefit from a low implied initial cash coupon over the first ten years despite only providing approximately 4% of the upfront capital needed to purchase the assets, while we expect will allow NextEra Energy Partners to achieve a full return of its capital invested into this acquisition in less than two years. Additionally, the financing will provide NextEra Energy Partners the flexibility to periodically buy out the investor's equity interest between the five and ten-year anniversaries of the agreement at a fixed pre-tax return of approximately 5.6% inclusive of all prior distributions, making this NextEra Energy Partners' lowest cost convertible equity portfolio financing to date. NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to pay up to 100% of the buyout price in NEP common units, issued at no discount to the then-current market price. NextEra Energy Partners also issued approximately 7.25 million new NEP common units during the fourth quarter to acquire the remaining equity interests in a portfolio of 1,388 megawatts of wind and solar assets associated with the convertible equity portfolio financing that NEP entered into in 2018. NextEra Energy Partners funded the remaining roughly $265 million of the approximately $885 million of total consideration for the acquisition of equity in the portfolio with project-level debt issued on a subset of the underlying assets. The nearly $650 million project financing supported by these assets, which was also the lowest-cost project-level debt financing in the partnership's history, is reflective of the strong performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio and also supported financing of other growth opportunities executed in 2021. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low-80% range. Given the successful execution of the recent acquisition from Energy Resources, as well as the approximately 100-megawatt operating wind facility from a third party, year-end December 31, 2021 run-rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution exceeded our previous expectations ranges. As a result, today we are introducing new year-end 2021 run-rate expectation ranges for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $1.635 billion to $1.795 billion and $640 million to $720 million, respectively. With the combination of strong cash flow generation from the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, including the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new renewables and storage added during 2021 and its relatively low payout ratio, NextEra Energy Partners has significant flexibility in terms of acquisitions in the coming year. Although acquisitions could occur at any time in 2022, for modeling purposes it may be practical to assume that any new unannounced asset additions occur late in 2022 and therefore have limited contributions to the calendar-year 2022 expectations implied by the year-end 2021 run rates for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution for the portfolio that we just discussed. NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2022 remain unchanged. Year-end 2022 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and CAFD in the range of $675 million to $765 million, respectively, reflecting calendar-year 2023 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as an operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. Florida Power & Light, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have an outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2021 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects and, while we have a lot to execute on in 2022, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions. Julien, as you might appreciate, and I'm sure everyone does on the call, when we think about our ranges of expectations, particularly when we're talking about several years out, like you asked about specifically 2025, there are quite a number of variables that we consider in order to set those ranges. And in particular, for the comment that we provided that we'd be disappointed not to be at the high end of each of those ranges, including 2025. I would say the key parts that we think about, first on Florida Power & Light Company, we've got the outcome from the four year settlement agreement that is now the \u2013 how we expect to operate for the next couple of years, and that creates the opportunity to continue investing in the business and executing on the strategy that's been so successful for customers over quite a number of years looking back, so we can continue that for the next couple of years. And we believe that, that will enable us to grow rate base in the range of 8% to 9% on a compound annual growth rate basis, assuming all of the investments that were anticipated in the settlement agreement, ultimately, we're able to successfully bring into service. On the Energy Resources side, the biggest drivers are the ones that we've talked about and are laid out in the slide materials on Page 16. Looking at our development ranges for all of wind, solar, energy storage and wind repowering over this four year period from 2021 through 2024, which obviously would have the largest impact on what our earnings look like in 2025. As Jim highlighted, if there is change in regulatory or incentive structures, we would obviously factor that in the future. But that's not anticipated in these estimates, and we feel really good about how we're positioned to execute between now and then. We do have to execute a lot. We have to execute the energy resources, which I'm excited to take on that challenge. We have a lot to do to continue delivering like we have at Florida Power & Light, but I think we're in a great position to do so. Thank you, Julien. Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Thanks, Shar. And I appreciate the question. We do think there's a lot of opportunities as I talked about in the prepared remarks, not only of purely executing our renewables for the electricity sector, but helping use clean energy to decarbonize these other industries. And we're thinking about some of these investment opportunities as a way to explore how those business models and investment opportunities are ultimately going to shape up over time. But to answer your direct question around the incentives, the investments we've made to date do not assume that there's a change of incentives or even the specific question around hydrogen that there's a hydrogen PTC. But as John and his team, the Energy Resources team has evaluated a number of hydrogen pilot opportunities or future business opportunities. They certainly would be furthered and helped. Some of them would be by hydrogen PTC. And that's one of the things that I know we, as a whole team remain optimistic about that if something happens, whether it's the full BBB or just a climate title that happens through reconciliation, we're optimistic that a hydrogen incentive would be included in that package. I think there's a lot of opportunities to further the decarbonization of the U.S. economy through the use of hydrogen. So short answer, investments don't assume it, but I think there's even more opportunity if there are some incentives like the hydrogen PTC in the future. Yes. One of the strategic imperatives, the way that we think about managing the business over the long-term, and I highlighted a couple of times in remarks and we highlighted on a consistent basis because it's a high priority for us is maintaining that strong balance sheet. As you've seen, quality of credit degrade elsewhere in the industry, we have remained as committed as ever to maintaining that strong balance sheet. We think it's a huge differentiator for us and being able to execute our business to deploy the capital that we deploy and to provide the stability that our customers assume and expect from us, we think a strong balance sheet is imperative. So, as we think about all of these investment opportunities, the growth in our business, that will remain a priority, and we will assume that as part of the way that we're thinking about the business as a private facia part of the strategy. Thanks, Shar. I think for base assumptions, we're including some assumptions around what we think we can do with these types of businesses. But as always, there's pluses and minuses. Fortunately, for us, they've largely been pluses in recent history, and we've been able to deliver adjusted EPS growth in excess of even what we, they have anticipated or laid out for investors prior to delivering. So hopefully, we'll be in a position to do that again over time. But for now, I think you should safely assume that our expectations are the ones we just laid out in the last couple of minutes. And we'll use all of these levers to deliver against those and again, hopefully achieve as we expect the high end of each of these ranges, which we would feel very proud of and see as enormously value accretive to shareholders. Thank you, Stephen. Yes, it's probably about $7 billion to $8 billion per year. It's included, Michael, in the regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 8% to 9% per year. There's a mix, of course, Michael, as you might expect and we certainly have our best laid plans that will include as part of the updated CapEx tables in the 10-K when we publish it in a couple of weeks. One comment on that, I would make and obviously there's a difference between, as you recall, from the CapEx table for FPL versus Energy Resources. But in both cases, as you get closer to that operating year, the teams tend to find good investment opportunities that are value accretive from a customer standpoint and may add and subtract to those over time. But those will be our best estimates based on what we've seen so far and also under the parameters of the settlement agreement inclusive of the SolarTogether investments that were approved as part of the settlement agreement. And also anticipate the current views around the investments on both storm hardening and undergrounding that, as you know, are included in a clause mechanism and recovered separately and approved separately over time. Those change over time depending on what we see and where we see the value coming for our customers, but we feel very good about the overall views. And of course, we'll give more details as we go into the investor conference in June. Sure. Let me answer the \u2013 I don't know if you're asking full on the NextEra Energy side where we typically have the language would be disappointed not to be at or near the high end. That language is exactly the same. And if anything changes solely a stumble on my part in terms of speaking, but the language is exactly the same. If you're asking specifically around Florida Power & Light Company, the approved range, as you know, for the settlement agreement is the range of 9.7% to 11.7%. And my comment was specifically around our expectations for 2022, which, of course, is the first year of the new settlement agreement. And that also includes the one-year limitation that was included in the settlement agreement around the use of surplus amortization just in this year, which is a maximum amount of $200 million. When we think about everything, what our investment plans are, our opportunities for continuing to focus on cost improvements, other improvements for customers, the investments that we plan to make, and the use of the surplus amortization, including the shape over time. We believe that at the end of the year we'll be able to report a regulatory ROE at the high end of the range. Where exactly that is, of course, we'll refine it over the \u2013 as the year progresses. And then, of course, we'll be targeting the high end of the ROE range in future years as well. Thank you so much, Michael. Good morning, Jeremy. And I think, Jeremy, you had a second question going into the investor conference. Can you remind me what that was?"

            "name": "Jim Robo",
            "content": "Thanks, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had an outstanding year in 2021 and are well positioned to capitalize on the substantial opportunities that lie ahead. NextEra Energy's performance was strong both financially and operationally, and we executed the largest capital program in our history, investing approximately $16 billion in American Energy infrastructure in 2021, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all industries. Continuing our long track record of delivering value for shareholders, NextEra Energy achieved full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55, up more than 10% from 2020. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of approximately 9%, which is the highest among all top 10 U.S. power companies, who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of roughly 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry. In 2021, we delivered a total shareholder return of more than 23%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Utilities Index and continuing to outperform both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index in terms of total shareholder return on a 3, 5, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and quadrupled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we've outperformed 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of providing growth and value creation opportunities for our shareholders, and we remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years. At FPL, net income increased nearly 11% year-over-year while continuing to deliver on its commitment to making smart, long-term investments in innovative technology, clean energy and strengthening our electric grid for the benefit of our customers. We were pleased the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously approved the settlement agreement in October, an agreement, which we believe is a fair and balanced outcome in our base rate case. The 2021 settlement agreement supports continued smart capital investments, including the largest solar build-out by a utility in the U.S. while keeping FPL's typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through the end of 2025. For customers in Northwest Florida, typical customer bills are projected to decline over the next four years. Among the long-term infrastructure investments anticipated in the new agreement, new solar generation is expected to grow through the expanded SolarTogether community solar program, which is expected to more than double over the next four years, as well as through new base rate solar generation, including the nearly 1,800 megawatts to be recovered under solar base rate adjustments, or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations in 2024 and 2025. In total, our current solar build-out expectations are for approximately 4,800 megawatts of new solar over the term of the settlement agreement. In early 2019, FPL announced its ground-breaking goal to install 30 million solar panels in Florida by 2030. With the anticipated solar additions approved under the settlement agreement, I am pleased to announce that we now expect to reach this milestone by 2025, five years earlier than previously anticipated. Including the solar additions anticipated through 2025, this ambitious 30-by-30 initiative is expected to have generated approximately $2.5 billion in fuel cost savings for customers and created more than 20,000 construction jobs, while supporting the Florida economy with more than $700 million in property taxes over the life of the assets. During 2021, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing another 671 megawatts of cost effective solar in service, completing the first roughly 1,500-megawatt phase of our SolarTogether community solar program. Additionally, last month we commissioned the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will allow our customers to benefit from low-cost solar energy even during times when the sun is not shining. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2021, and FPL was recognized for the sixth time in seven years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Moreover, FPL was ranked number one in both residential and business customer satisfaction in the southern U.S. amongst large electric providers by J.D. Power in 2021, and we are completely committed to continuing to provide clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2021, delivering adjusted earnings growth of 13% versus the prior year. The team also had an outstanding, record year of renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 7,200 net megawatts to our backlog during the year as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring in our nation's generation fleet. Our backlog additions have grown at a more than 20% compound annual growth rate since 2017, and we are well on our way to meeting our current development expectations for new signed contracts. With the significant additions to our backlog of signed contracts over the last year, we've now signed nearly 80% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range with significant time remaining to sign additional power purchase agreements. Our supply chain and engineering and construction teams also continued to execute in 2021, commissioning approximately 3,800 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, solar and storage projects. Over the past two years, Energy Resources has constructed more than 9,500 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of its execution expertise even in the midst of a global pandemic and industry-wide supply chain disruptions. Finally, during 2021 NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution by increasing net income by nearly 20% over its previous earnings contribution record in 2020. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transition to a low-cost, low-carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. We anticipate that NextEra Energy Transmission will continue to capitalize on the growing opportunity set to both deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. The tremendous execution of both of the major businesses in recent years including 2021 gives us great visibility to the longer-term outlook of NextEra Energy. Let me start with our opportunity set, which I would not trade with anyone in our industry. At Florida Power & Light, the settlement agreement allows us to focus on operating the business efficiently, reliably and affordably for the benefit of our customers. Under the new agreement, we expect our average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be between 8 and 9 percent over the four-year term through 2025. When you put it all together: low bills, best-in-class reliability, award-winning customer service and a clean emissions profile are what help FPL provide, what we believe, is one of the best customer value propositions in the nation. At Energy Resources, our outlook for new renewables and storage development remains as strong as ever, and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old, inefficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable, low-cost renewables and storage. We believe that the rapidly accelerating trend toward electrification and decarbonization of a broad range of sectors across the U.S. economy has significantly increased the total addressable market for new renewables and storage even beyond our expectations just a few years ago and is now measured in trillions of dollars of capital investment opportunity in the coming decades. We believe that Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to advance its market leadership position in this environment. We have been in the renewables business for more than 30 years and have the experience, resources, balance sheet, talent and advanced data capabilities necessary to execute complex renewable energy generation and storage integration projects at scale. We believe we have an excellent opportunity set for continued growth ahead of us at Energy Resources, and we will further discuss our long-term plans for deploying renewables at both Energy Resources and Florida Power & Light and the associated impact to our overall emissions profile and future goals at our upcoming investor conference, which we plan to hold on June 14th in New York City. With the anticipated continued strength of the investment opportunities at both Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2022 and 2023 and introducing our expectations for 2024 and 2025. For 2022, we are now expecting our adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85, up from our prior range of $2.55 to $2.75. For years 2023 through 2025, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly 6 to 8 percent per year off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share. For 2023, this translates to a new range of $2.93 to $3.08, up from our prior range of $2.77 to $2.97. Our new adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2024 are $3.13 to $3.33, and for 2025 are $3.35 to $3.60. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. In summary, we continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unitholder return of approximately 30% in 2021, bringing its two-year total unitholder return up to more than 72% and further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO in 2014. For 2021, the NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by 15% year-over-year and has now grown its distributions per unit by nearly 280% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve-month payout ratio of approximately 80% as of year-end 2021. NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year of execution in 2021 and we are increasing our year-end 2021 financial expectations to reflect this better-than-expected growth execution. NextEra Energy Partners delivered year-end run-rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in excess of our prior expectations, including delivering more than 13% year-over-year growth in run-rate cash available for distribution at the midpoints. This execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2021. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,900 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. In addition, during the year NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed two acquisitions of renewable energy assets from third parties, adding nearly 500 megawatts of operating wind projects to its portfolio. These transactions demonstrate NextEra Energy' ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources, low-cost sources of capital and our strong industry relationships to be successful in third party acquisitions. The combination of a growing portfolio at Energy Resources and a growing set of opportunities to acquire renewables from third parties, as well as significant organic growth opportunities, further supports the partnership's long-term growth visibility. NextEra Energy Partners also continue to demonstrate its ability to access attractive sources of capital to finance its growth investments, including executing on the lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in its history. The roughly $820 million convertible equity portfolio financing carries a low implied cash coupon to the investor and partially funded NextEra Energy Partners acquisition of a 50% interest in a renewable portfolio, consisting of approximately 2,520 megawatts of newly constructed or in construction renewables projects and approximately 115 megawatts of integrated battery storage. NextEra Energy Partners was able to demonstrate the benefits to LP, unit holders of the convertible equity portfolio financing structure during the fourth quarter, when the partnership exercised its right to purchase 100% of the outstanding, minority equity interests in the portfolio of wind and solar assets supporting it's 2018, convertible equity portfolio financing. Relative to issuing the same amount of common equity in 2018 to fund our growth needs, this financing allowed us to reduce unit issuance by more than 50% and save more than $140 million or roughly 75% and nominal cash costs, while retaining the more than 80% increase in the NEP unit price over the last three years. NextEra Energy Partners public float has increased approximately 50% since 2019. We believe our strategy of using low-cost, convertible equity products to efficiently layer in common equity over time has created significant value for existing LP unit holders. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners clean energy, portfolio growth visibility and financing flexibility offers LP unit holders, a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unit holder value over the coming years. Finally, I'd like to comment on some important organizational changes that we announced this morning. These changes are part of a long-term succession process undertaken by the Board and me over the better part of the last six years. Effective, March 1 John Ketchum apprised me as President and CEO of NextEra Energy. Rebecca will succeed John as President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources; Kirk Crews currently Vice President of Business Management for NextEra Energy Resources will secede Rebecca as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy. John, Rebecca and Kirk will also be appointed to the respective roles at NextEra Energy Partners. In addition, Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company has been named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CEO for nearly ten years. I'm as excited as I have ever been about the future prospects of NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. A big part of a CEO's legacy is the new leader in the next-generation leadership team that follows. And I couldn't be more thrilled about turning over the CEO role of this great company to John. I know he will be as focused on creating value for you, our owners, as I have been over the last two decades. John has been an incredible partner to me and a senior leader in this company for more than 19 years. And I can think of no better person to succeed me as CEO. John's breadth of experience across all aspects of our company, including commercial, operational, financial, and legal, as well as the significant leadership capabilities and vision, position him exceptionally well to lead NextEra Energy to even greater heights in the coming years. I also want to congratulate Rebecca, Eric and Kirk on their new roles. One of the defining characteristics of this company over the last 30 years has been the quality and strength of its leadership team, and I'm very proud of and excited for the team that will leave this company into the future. Most importantly, I want to thank my team and all our employees for all that they have done. Our team, the best in the business, has built this amazing company, and I can't thank them enough. As the announcement mentioned, I'm going to remain as Executive Chairman for a transition period to support John in his new role. I will now turn the call over to John, who would like to make some remarks. Thank you. So Julien, let me take that. So we don't need BBB to deliver on the expectations that we've just laid out, right. I think about BBB as an accelerator, not as something that we would need in order to deliver on what we just laid out in terms of the earnings or the backlog growth that we've projected through 2024. In terms of how am I feeling about BBB, I would say two things? I am optimistic about something happening some point this year. And I would say that might \u2013 when I say optimistic, I would say more likely than not. I think I was \u2013 I think I felt more optimistic in the fourth quarter than I do now. I think that's just reality, but I do think it's more likely than not that the clean energy piece of BBB gets acted on this year. I do think it's going to take a while. And everything we have heard says there is particularly in the Senate, I think a desire for some process and process takes time, given the Senate rules. And my sense is that it's not going to be a first quarter event, it's going to be post that either a second quarter event or honestly, probably more likely sometime in the fourth quarter after the election. Sure, Julien. I think on some of the Florida political headlines, I think what I'd like to say on that is pretty simple. When we got \u2013 when we received the report and those allegations that have been in the press, we conducted a very extensive and thorough investigation that included looking at company financial records. It includes looking at everyone who was named in its company e-mails also looking at their \u2013 they've all provided access to their personal e-mails and text to us as part of that investigation. And the bottom line is we found no evidence of any issues at all, any illegality or any wrongdoing on the part of FPL or any of its employees. And so, that's kind of the bottom line. And I feel very good about the investigation that we did, and I feel very good that there is no basis to any of these allegations. So I think that's probably all that we're going to say on that today. And I think Rebecca is going to talk about the 2025, your question on 2025. Sure, Steve. So I think my focus is going to be to help John with the transition and in particular, help John with the transition as it relates to the Board. You should think about my transition time in terms of months, not years. And that's probably all we're ready to say about it today. But my real focus is going to be on making John as successful as I know he will be. So Jeremy, this is Jim, on the transition. I think you heard in the prepared remarks, this is something that the Board and I have been working on really in earnest since \u2013 well, honestly, in earnest, since my first succession planning discussion as CEO back in 2012. But I let the Board know that my target for retiring as CEO was after \u2013 I let them know this in 2016, honestly, that my target was after the 2020 rate case. And I actually extended kind of my time line a bit to get through this rate case. And so that's been \u2013 it's been my plan for a very long time. Obviously, we didn't make any decisions about it until we announced it here. But it's been something that the Board and I have been discussing for a very long time and we've been very deliberate about the succession planning that we've done, and I'm really pleased with the team that's going to be leading the company into the future."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. I have been privileged to have worked with and learned from Jim during an incredible period of growth for our company. And I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this company in the years ahead. As CEO, I intend to remain intensely focused on delivering value for our shareholders and building upon our long track record of success. I believe there is no company better positioned to lead our country's energy transformation than NextEra Energy. And I am humbled by the opportunity to lead this team through such an exciting period for our company. I am fortunate to have a broad leadership team with the experience and capability that I, too, believe is the best in the industry. I am very excited to have Eric, Rebecca and Kirk take on these expanded and new roles in the company. They, along with our broader leadership team and all of our approximately 15,000 employees, work tirelessly every day to serve our customers in Florida and across North America. Finally, I wanted to take a moment to thank Jim for his exceptional leadership and friendship. Jim has been an unbelievable steward of this company over his nearly ten years as CEO, growing the leading, most profitable, electric utility and renewable energy company in North America. Our total shareholder return during Jim's tenure has been more than 500%, and it is great evidence of Jim's exceptional vision, leadership and commitment to excellence. I know I speak for all of our employees that we are deeply grateful for everything Jim has done for our company. Let me now turn it over to Rebecca for a more detailed review of our results. Yes. Steve, I'll take this. This is John. First of all, we're coming off a record year with 7.3 gigawatts, had a strong fourth quarter, posting about 1,500 megawatts. What we are seeing in the market is continued strong demand, and that's coming from a number of different sources. It's not only coming from investor-owned utilities and munis and co-ops, but also C&I. As there's been a lot of rotation of capital into ESG funds, it's certainly getting investor attention and putting an impetus on companies to become sustainable. And so one of the things that we've spent a lot of time on over the last couple of years is our customer base and how do we market to a different customer base, not that the investor-owned utility and muni and co-op won't always be our core. It will be. But we're doing some things differently, too, around C&I., for example. Some of you might have seen the Optos release where JPMorgan is partnering with us on new software product, where we go in and we basically are able to calculate exactly what their energy footprint looks like today. How we can make it better, how we can take money out of the bill, how we can make it greener. That's just one example of some of the things that we're doing differently in terms of the ways that we approach the customer. And when I look at the pipeline that we have in place, the land positions, the interconnects, it's second to none. It's an area of certainly focus that we are continuing to build out. We'll talk a lot more about that at the Analyst Day. But we have the best sites, the best team, the best talent the best analytics and the normal competitive advantages of being able to manage the supply chain operate cheaper, finance cheaper, all those things come together, give us a lot of optimism about the future. Yes, I'll take that as well, Steve. I think Rebecca covered certainly the FPL piece. And then you think about Energy Resources. We've doubled the backlog in the last few years; continue to see a lot of promise there with or without build back better. Jim said, more likely than not that we're able to get something passed there by the end of the year. But we plan our business as if it doesn't happen. And our financial forecast is based on it not happening. And that's why we were very resolute in our ability to take our expectations up not only for 2022, but to extend the guidance out through 2025. And that's just based on what we see in our renewable backlog. And when you think about the expectations that we laid out for investors for 2021 and 2022, I think, we've done a terrific job of meeting those and then laying out 2023 and 2024. We've made tremendous headway against those expectations. Yes, let me take that one. I think you identified some of the obvious ones that we have that we are addressing, certainly, supply chain and those types of issues, and I think we've answered those. I think when I look at the market today, Stephen, the issue for companies to be successful or not successful; the biggest differentiator is going to be many of the questions that you just asked. And are you positioning your company for what is going to be a more complex energy offering that is going to be demanded by the customer? Rebecca gave the example of a C&I customer. It's not as simple as being able to approach a C&I customer and say, \"Hey, I'm going to sell you 100 megawatts of wind or 100 megawatts of solar or what do you think about a 50-megawatt battery?\" These are people that are selling candy bars, and bottles of water and things of that nature. They are not in our business. They need the expertise as to how they think about that addition within their existing energy needs. And so, it takes a comprehensive skill set in order to come forward with a clean energy solution that makes sense for that business. And so, when you think about a lot of the small developers that we have to compete against in solar and wind, they don't have that expertise. They don't have the ability to offer firm and shape products and things that it's going to take to really win the business. That's the first piece. The second piece is the question you asked around technology. We have been very aggressive in our investment around technology. We've talked about the NextEra Energy analytics team that we bought back in 2005. We have really built that team out. It's a group of PhD, mathematicians, software developers, software engineers, that not only use those tools to help manage our existing fleet and help leverage and drive operating efficiencies around what we do every day in managing our existing footprint, but they're now able to take all that data, all that information, all that know-how to develop comprehensive software solutions for customers. And that is a huge leg up that we have over the rest of the industry, and one of the things that we're looking at. And the third thing is renewable enablers. We are really looking at what it means to lead the energy transition. What are you going to have to be good at? And what capabilities are you going to have to have as an organization to really do that. And we have been spending the last three or four years, very focused on it. We don't talk a lot about some of the things that we're up to. You'll get more details at the Analyst Day, but needless to say and be self-assured, we're ready. Yes. For the Analyst Day, first of all we have never been in a better position. We're coming off of what I would characterize as our best year as a company. And it's been really a testament to the entire lead team, not only obviously the job Jim's done, but the job Eric's done, the job Rebecca's done and the leadership team that we have in place at Energy Resources. We have an extremely deep bench with a ton of experience. I've been here almost two decades. Eric's been here almost two decades. Rebecca has been here 15 years. And we have just a wealth of experience in the team that will bring full bear on the opportunity set that we have that we have going forward. And the way I think about it is we will continue to double down on the core. That means execution. Like \u2013 unlike what we've seen in the past around FPL and the capital plan that they have for customers and for shareholders, the renewable opportunity that we have in this country. Don't forget renewables are cheap; they're the cheapest form of generation in this country with or without incentive. So we have a tremendous opportunity there as well. And then the third piece I would characterize as the renewable enablers. What are the other things that we can do as a company that we've been working on behind the scenes that will help position us to be the leader of the energy transition in this country, and we're going to deal with the best team in the industry. So that's really what you're going to hear about at the Analyst Day."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nJessica Aldridge: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com.

You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reportable segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation, when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year. Both the principal businesses executed well on major initiatives and we continue to advance our opportunity set for new renewables and storage. Building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, NextEra Energy is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for 2021 and beyond. Earlier this month, we were honored to be named on Fortune's 2021 Change the World list, the only electric utility in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy's best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities that we serve. At FPL, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior-year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business. Most notably, during the quarter, we reached what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement with a number of intervenors in our rate case, continuing a long history of negotiated outcomes that benefit both customers and shareholders. We believe the agreement, if approved, should enable us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently while investing in the future to ensure resilience, reliability, affordability and clean energy for generations to come in Florida. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at its agenda conference on October 26, and I'll provide more details on the proposed agreement in a few minutes. FPL's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also had a great quarter of execution, and its strong year-to-date financial performance is attributable to continued successful implementation of the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we previously outlined. Gulf Power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior-year comparable period. And we remain focused on improving Gulf Power value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year. Our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatt to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in Energy Resources' history. These backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500 megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which I'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes. We continue to expect that our competitive advantages will drive meaningful growth in renewables and various forms of energy storage at Energy Resources in the coming years, as the trend toward broad decarbonization across many facets of the US economy takes hold. Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2021, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy, and we are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats. Now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 2021. During the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of $597 million. As you know, much of the East Coast of the US was recently impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the Northeastern US. Our deepest sympathies are with those that have been impacted by Ida's widespread destruction. We value deeply the industry's commitment to mutual assistance and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share. Gulf Power's third quarter EPS contribution was flat versus the prior-year comparable quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the reversal of COVID-19 related expenses that had occurred earlier in that year. During the quarter, Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to be roughly $800 million. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect Gulf Power's regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost effective zero emission solar capacity online within the next six months. The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across the two different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. These continued smart capital investments in renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. During the quarter, Gulf Power was impacted by Tropical Storm Fred, which experienced an unexpected change in path before striking the service territory. Through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, Gulf Power was able to restore its service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by Fred in Northwest Florida in less than 24 hours. Moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours. Our culture of preparation, including our annual storm drills and the team's focused execution helped ensure an efficient, timely and safe response to the tropical storm. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. Florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months reflecting the ongoing recovery, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The real estate sector in Florida also continues to grow with a three-month average new housing starts up over 40% year-over-year. In August alone, there are -- there were twice as many new housing starts in Florida than in the average over the last 10 years. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%. As another indicator of Florida's economic health, Florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior-year comparable period. A decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior-year quarter. And Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably. As a reminder, on March 12th, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding for rate relief beginning in January of 2022. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early August with a number of intervenors in the proceeding. The Office of Public Counsel, The Florida Retail Federation, The Florida Industrial Power Users Group, The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Vote Solar, The CLEO Institute and The Federal Executive Agencies all joined the agreement, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base. The four-year proposed agreement, which begins on January 2022 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown on the accompanying slide and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7%, and no change to FPL's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system. Should the average 30-year US Treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive six-month period during the term of the agreement, Florida Power & Light's allowed regulatory ROE would increase to 10.8% with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%. Additionally, if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed agreement, Florida Power & Light would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after review of the impacts on base revenue requirements. The proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus. Consistent with the rate plan filed in March, the proposed settlement agreement would unify the rates and tariffs of FPL and Gulf Power by implementing a five-year transition rider and credit mechanism to address the initial differences in cost of serving the existing FPL and Gulf Power customers. Additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. FPL would also be authorized to expand its SolarTogether voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current SolarTogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars over the lifetime of the assets. In addition to solar energy, the settlement agreement would support FPL's green hydrogen pilot project in Okeechobee County. This innovative technology could one day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day. The proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across Florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. FPL's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average. The proposed agreement would keep typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through 2025. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively year-over-year. The effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' third quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses. All other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020, driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources' development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today. Through the three -- first three quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog. Energy Resources' backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts. At this early stage, we have made terrific progress toward our long-term development expectations with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post 2022 backlog. Our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500 megawatt wind project, the majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company. The project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facility's load requirements. The hydrogen manufactured by the facility would enable commercial and industrial end users to replace their current gray hydrogen and fossil fuel purchases with emissions-free green hydrogen, further accelerating the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors. Energy Resources also add nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in California, and we continue to experience significant demand from California based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions. We are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in California with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024, to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals. More than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in California and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free sustainable future. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter, Energy Resources entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of rate regulated water and wastewater utility assets in eight counties near Houston, Texas. The proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022. Energy Resources is also currently in construction on an innovative water reuse and reclamation project that would help our customer achieve significant savings on its water supply needs and make its operations more efficient and sustainable while at the same time, delivering attractive returns to Energy Resources. While the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from corporate and other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54 and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high-end of this range. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations so far for the year, we expect the fourth quarter results to include impacts from certain liability management activities that we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023. Our earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which performed well and delivered third quarter results generally in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top-end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners continues to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. In addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind asset in California from a third party to further expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility. The project is located in a strategic market with strong expected growth in renewables demand, and it also offers significant optionality to NextEra Energy Partners in terms of operational savings and long-term value creation. NextEra Energy Partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. NextEra Energy Partners expects to recapitalize this project finance debt in 2022 as it executes on its overall financing plan for the year. We expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close later this year or in 2022. Following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on a five-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. NextEra Energy Partners continues to leverage its competitive advantages to be successful in third-party M&A and extend its long runway of growth. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2022 run rate expectations, which are built upon its strong existing portfolio cash generation and continued ability to access low cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party, contributed $23 million. Existing assets contributed $7 million, primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource. Wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower solar resource in the third quarter of this year. Cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year, primarily as a result of lower year-over-year PAYGO payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners recapitalized its Genesis Solar project and other existing assets at the end of last year and the impact of this new project level financing cost versus the prior year was offset by an associated reduction in corporate level interest expense as reflected in our other category. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. On a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively. And NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. We expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. By year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million. At the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations. These growth rates are supported by our strong execution against our long-term growth objectives in 2021, including opportunistic third-party transactions that were not previously in our plan. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. Finally, during the quarter, S&P updated its ratings methodology for NextEra Energy Partners. And in particular, it will now evaluate NextEra Energy Partners debt metrics on a funds from operations or FFO to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-EBITDA basis. We believe that the combination of S&P's updated methodology, its assessment of NextEra Energy Partners improving diversity and its use of less conservative assumptions in the portfolios and renewable generation cash flows will allow for several hundred million dollars more of financing flexibility relative to our previous assumptions, providing the partnership with even greater flexibility going forward to finance accretive acquisition for the benefit of our unitholders. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Impressive continued results here. Just if I can ask you at the outset here, can you perhaps describe how you see the backdrop here given the litany of different policy efforts underway around the availability of panel imports, and just how that positions your ability to execute right now. I certainly hear it echoing through your comments, but I just want to speak to that a little bit more specifically, if we can. And then subsequently, on the origination side, obviously, well down again. How do you think about the -- just the elevated energy price backdrop that we're seeing today? How quickly is that fomenting sort of a reinvigorated demand backdrop? And when could that materialize as you think about the backdrop in the '23, '24 backdrop or beyond?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Julien. I appreciate the questions, and good morning. As you even prefaced in your set of questions, we're pretty excited about the opportunities for both of the major businesses, both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. And specifically on the renewable side and Energy Resources, the team just had an awesome origination quarter, and that's kind of on the heels of other awesome origination quarters going back now for quite some time, setting us up for tremendous growth in the coming years. So in terms of demand backdrop, to kind of answer the second question first, it's terrific, and we're really excited about the value proposition of renewables looking forward, both in terms of being low cost and the ability to decarbonize both the electricity sector and other sectors as we've talked about. It's been an exciting 18 months for our integrated supply chain and engineering construction teams. Lots of opportunities to navigate uncertainties, likes of which we and the industry probably haven't seen in quite some time. And it's also in the midst of enormous growth for us, a record year of renewables deployment last year and another terrific capital deployment year this year, so both growth and opportunities to show what we can do. It's good to be us. I mean, we've highlighted that in the past in the sense of being large in this industry, having significant capital dollars to put to work, enables us to have strong relationships and extensive relationships with those in the supply chain to help navigate these uncertainties. We feel good about our ability to navigate them. The plan does get iterated from time to time as the circumstances change, but we feel good about the long-term view for renewables and our ability to deliver on our expectations.\nJames L. Robo: Hey, Julien. Just --\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Go ahead, Jim.\nJames L. Robo: The only thing I'd add is I think people don't really appreciate the 10-year strip is up $1 since January. It's hugely positive for the renewable business, enormously positive, right? So --\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve Fleishman: Thanks and good morning. Just could you maybe just give the name of the -- who the counterparty is for the green hydrogen project?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Yes, prefer not to, Steve. We're obviously really excited about the opportunity to supply them and provide this energy, and we think it is a great start to the hydrogen economy. But we'll leave that discussion for a later date.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on the -- a different way to ask the supply chain question. Just within your -- obviously, you had a lot to your backlog. If you look at the existing backlog, did anything move around meaningfully between years --\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Not meaningfully.\nSteve Fleishman: In the backlog?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: I appreciate the question. No, nothing that I would consider to be meaningful at all. There's a couple of projects that moved out and a couple of projects that moved in, in terms of time frames, but very much consistent with our expectations. And as I highlighted at a very high level in response to Julien's question, we feel good about our plans of bringing in the projects we expect to bring into service in 2021 and have good line of sight for executing on the development plans thereafter.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then last question, just obviously, I have to ask about the DC and the proposed clean energy credits and the reconciliation, etc., maybe just latest thoughts on what's most important to you and the likelihood and path to passage, how you're feeling about it?\nJames L. Robo: So Steve, it's Jim. I would say that we remain cautiously optimistic that something happens on that front. I think I said earlier, if there is a reconciliation bill, I would be shocked if there isn't a long-term extension of the credits embedded in that. And I think that's reasonably high odds if the Democrats can come to terms among themselves around what would be in the reconciliation bill. And that's not an easy -- as we've seen play out over the last several weeks, that's not an easy -- that's not easy and there's, obviously, within that, that caught us [Phonetic] a lot of varying views across the board. But I think -- so I remain cautiously optimistic that something happens there. And then if something happens there, we feel good about the fact that there will be a long-term extension of the credits and that there will be support for other types of clean energy such as hydrogen, a stand-alone storage ITC, etc. So, yes, it would be very constructive for us. We think it's an important part of the decarbonization of the US economy to accelerate that. And I mean, we've increasingly -- as we think about our own strategy going forward, we're increasingly thinking about ourselves as the company that's going to lead not only the clean energy transformation of the electric grid, but really the clean energy transformation of the US economy and the decarbonization of the US economy because the electric grid is going to be the key to decarbonizing the transport sector, it's going to be the key to decarbonizing the industrial sector. And so we're really positioning ourselves to be the leader there and I feel very good about both the policy tailwinds that we have as well as how our business is executing along those goals.\nSteve Fleishman: And I'm sorry, just one follow-up. The -- this wind project for green hydrogen, is it -- does it depend on the hydrogen PTC passing? Or does it happen either way?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: No, it's a contract with the customer irrespective of any sort of subsequent policy changes.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Look, I just wanted to maybe just drill down a little bit more on the backlog there. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the higher input costs for projects? I mean, we've seen some headwinds from developers and manufacturers recently on the labor, steel, transportation, etc. What do you -- and we're hearing some commercial and utility scale projects are being pushed out. What are you seeing -- are you seeing any impact to the project economics, especially for the ones that are marginal? Is anyone kind of with signed contracts maybe bulking, especially if the PPA terms are somewhat flexible as we think about when a shovel needs to be put in the ground? So you're not seeing it right now, but is there any inkling on potential projects potentially being shifted out as buyers wait for some input cost relief?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Shar, I'm not sure I'm following completely the question. Are you asking whether or not there are other projects -- not our projects, but other projects that might be experiencing those? Or are you asking for us? Because I wasn't sure who the buyers were in that -- in your question.\nShar Pourreza: Sorry, specifically for your projects.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: We are not having any -- anything notable from a buyer perspective. And from our customers' perspective, we have a contract, and we are expecting to execute against what's laid out in those contracts. And from a supply chain standpoint, I think, we're very well positioned to navigate these uncertainties. And as I highlighted, line of sight of bringing out the projects that we intend to bring in in '21 into service and have great plans for executing against our '22 development program. And obviously, beyond that, one, there's a lot still to be seen as to what those conditions will ultimately be because now we're talking two-plus years out. But a great team and a great position in the industry to be able to navigate those. From a customer standpoint, we're continuing to see strong demand for new renewables. I think that's obvious from the contract signings that we were able to announce today, and John and his team have terrific backlog beyond that of opportunities that we have yet to sign and the team is really excited about being out in the field and talking with our customers. It is just a terrific time for renewables in our industry.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you for that. Thanks for the elaboration. Maybe just quickly shifting to the regulated utility, just wondering also how much more headroom from incremental O&M efficiencies do you still anticipate from the legacy Gulf asset? And how is that sort of headroom impacted from the recent run-up in commodity costs, mainly natural gas, right? So a bit of an efficiency and bill headroom question embedded there.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Sure, Shar. And obviously, we continue to work diligently at now what's going to be FPL going forward, particularly assuming the settlement agreement is approved next week by the commission, Gulf will be fully incorporated into the broader FPL enterprise. It largely is today, but obviously, from a regulatory standpoint, operates separately at least through the end of this year. We think there are continued opportunities to focus on optimization across the businesses. That's part of what we do as a company, is look for those opportunities to take opportunities to bring efficiencies to the business, and of course, invest capital to take cost out and lower fuel costs over time. One of the great ways that FPL, and that includes Gulf as part of it, will be to continue to deploy solar over the long term, because as you all well know, not only does it have the clean energy benefits, but it has low operating costs and no fuel costs, which will be a great offset in diversification in the state of Florida from our existing generation set. So I think there's continued opportunities. There's still a lot of work to be done. We focus hard on that every day and we think the team is all the cards in the hand to be able to continue executing.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. So I guess, just not to paraphrase, but the recent jump in gas, and obviously, Jim highlighted the move in the forwards, that shouldn't really impact sort of the bill headroom just given the other leverage you have at the business?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Yes. So Shar, I would think if you look back at where we have taken the opportunity to invest capital historically, it really is on bringing long-term value to our customers. So being able to deliver lower cost over time, higher reliability, greater resilience, greater diversification and those clean energy benefits, and it would be short-sighted to stop investing in opportunities that are really clearly good for customers. We're very mindful of customer bills. You hear that from us from every day -- in all of our communications and it's what we focus on day to day, is making sure we have a terrific value proposition for our customers, and we will do everything we can to moderate those impacts over time.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I have one or two here. First of all, the water and wastewater utility system acquisitions in Texas, can you talk about just the size and scale of the capital you're employing there for that? And then more long-term, kind of more strategic, how do you think about the opportunity for growth in that business? Is it more organic? Is it more kind of continuing to roll up neighboring systems? Or are you thinking about a national strategy here?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Hey, Michael, and good morning, and thanks for the question. We did include in the prepared remarks, the comment about the $45 million, and that $45 million includes both the acquisition of the regulated utility assets as well as that innovative water reuse and reclamation project that we talked about it also on Energy Resources. So in terms of our capital program, investing $15 billion a year and more over time, it's pretty small. But we referenced it for a good reason, and that's because we're excited about the opportunities. I think it's a lot like transmission in the sense that it will be built slowly over time and create opportunities for us to continue to have that regulated and long-term contracted base of value creation for shareholders. On the other part, the kind of innovative use and reclamation project that we talked about on the Energy Resources side, those also bring clean energy renewable opportunities as we're able to bring this broad suite of clean energy and ESG focused investment opportunities for our commercial and industrial customers. That gives us the opportunity to have a deep relationship with them, not just bring one solution, but bring a portfolio of options to them. So we think it's a terrific opportunity for Energy Resources team to develop those meaningful relationships with our customers. So it's both an investment and a strategic opportunity from our perspective.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then one question on Seabrook, and I know in the grand scheme of its [Phonetic] earnings power, Seabrook, while it's a large plant, is nowhere near the biggest contributor of that. But just curious, how should we think about how much you financially hedge Seabrook? I'm just thinking about given the move in forward power prices, and Jim referenced the move in natural gas dollar increase in the strip, how we should think about whether Seabrook actually benefits from that materially or had you already significantly hedged it out prior?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Yes. So we have an ongoing hedging program that we execute ratably over time, executing a percentage of Seabrook's forward generation. So I would characterize it as pretty well hedged in the next couple of years. And then as you get out into the latter part of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, less so. So it obviously would benefit that -- if you mark-to-market that forward position, clearly, there's been some upside with the increase in natural gas prices and some of the congestion you've seen in the Northeast in terms of electricity prices. Whether that lasts in the long term, I think, remains to be seen, but certainly an opportunity for Seabrook. We continue to believe Seabrook is very well placed. It is in a particularly advantageous load zone. It's obviously in a region that values clean energy deeply. And you think about broad decarbonization in any part of the US, including the Northeast, well-positioned nuclear assets will be a key part of making that happen. So we very much appreciate the -- our nuclear team and think they do a terrific job every day and Seabrook is a key part of that.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.\nMaheep Mandloi: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Two on NEP actually. One on the multiple for the acquisition comes out around 11 times EBITDA versus the 9 times we saw for the prior two acquisitions, so job done. I just want to understand, has that been new normal you're seeing for asset acquisitions or anything specific to these projects? And just the second one on the 2022 CAFD walk, just want to confirm if it includes any repayment for the first BlackRock CEPF closed in 2018. Thanks.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: So I'll come back to the second question. In terms of the transaction, as we highlighted, it was a third-party transaction, so it reflects a negotiated outcome. And we continue to believe that the renewable sector remains of high interest for a lot of folks and expect it to be competitive over time. But I think you can see with this transaction and with a prior third-party transaction that we announced and closed earlier this year, there are some specific advantages that NextEra Energy Partners has, both in its ability to find attractive financing, but also the relationship it has with NextEra Energy Resources of being able to add value on the operating side and bring to bear all of the scale benefits that we have. So in terms of the second part of the question, I think you were asking about the 2018 CEPF, and ultimately, the conversion that will happen in the very latter part of this year. And we're still -- obviously, some significant part of that gets converted up to 70% of it in NEP units and the balance is paid in cash. And we are still working through what the full impacts are and how we will finance that over time. But as we've laid out in terms of our run rate expectations, we will expect that year-end '22 to be in the ranges that we outlined today.\nMaheep Mandloi: Got it now. Thanks for taking the questions.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the water utility acquisition strategy a bit. Obviously, this is in Texas, but there's obviously a ton of small municipal systems across the country, which are sort of owned by small mom-and-pop type facilities. Just are you going to sort of be more aggressive throughout the country? Or is there something specific about taxes as we think about you sort of competing for these small water utility systems?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Yes, I think it's a great question. As we've highlighted -- I highlighted, obviously, in the prepared remarks, and Jim has highlighted elsewhere in recent months, we're really excited about building a significant presence in the water business. And we think there's a lot of skills and capabilities, and of course, the broad platform we have that we could bring real value in these acquisitions. But as you highlighted, they tend to be very small, and whether they're privately owned or owned by municipalities, almost irregardless of the ownership structure, they tend to be small. Even the one I talked about today is incorporated with something else, and it totals up $45 million in context of our $15 billion capital program. So I expect us to be active. There's probably some regions of the US, where the team in the near term, will be more active than others for a variety of reasons, but it's probably not exclusively Texas and it will build over time. And we'll let you know if the team continues to have success.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you for the time.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks. Just want to pivot back to hydrogen for a minute, if we could here. And just want to see on what timeline do you see green hydrogen being competitive? And how much money is NEE currently spending on hydrogen -- hydrogen projects, and where could that ramp to over time?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: I think it's a great question. I think in the electricity sector, when it's going to be particularly relevant is the latter part of the 2020s into 2030s and beyond. And for the key reason for that being that you really need to have the need for long-duration storage, and it is particularly attractive when you have very, very low cost energy input, and particularly, low cost renewables, which will inevitably have when you have substantial renewable deployment, again, probably in the latter part of the 2020s and beyond. What may be different is in the transportation and industrial sector, where there's already built-in use of gray hydrogen and other fossil fuels that could be supplanted with green hydrogen when it's competitive. The big question mark would be whether or not there's a hydrogen production tax credit ultimately in the final reconciliation bill. Clearly, there's one anticipated today, and at $3 a kilogram production tax credit, that really closes the gap between gray hydrogen and green hydrogen alternatives. And so that's a terrific opportunity to see growth in the near term, and what that would represent is using green hydrogen alternatives to supplant gray hydrogen. From our perspective, that opportunity is clearly to build a lot of renewables and you saw the first step in that direction in our announcement today about a power purchase agreement that we've entered into. But there would be more -- a lot more like that in not just the renewable side, but also an opportunity for us to invest in the actual hydrogen production equipment such as the electrolyzer. So we'll see. We'll know a lot more in January once we've seen the final package, if there is one, as Jim highlighted and it will develop over time in terms of opportunities. We think it's exceptionally likely. It's really just a matter of timing.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just pivoting over real quick toward transmission, obviously, to optimize and maximize renewables deployment for the country, transmission build-out is a key ingredient there. Yet it's -- as you well know, it's difficult and timely to complete. Just wondering, I guess, your latest thoughts on what expectations you might have for transmission build-out and what role NEE could play there?\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Yes. We're really excited about transmission opportunities. Our NextEra Energy Transmission team has built a terrific business over the last decade with a number of organic wins as well as some acquisitions, as we've talked about in the past of, not only Trans Bay Cable, but GridLiance more recently, and we see a ton of opportunities going forward for us to be successful in winning some of those big opportunities to invest, realizing great returns, but also the strategic side of it of ensuring that it happens so that we can continue to realize the substantial renewables build-out that we already are seeing, and we expect to only continue to grow in this opportunity size over time. It may not be imperative today to have new transmission, but it's really, really important to start today because it will be imperative in the next decade and some of the policy considerations that FERC is undertaking today could be helpful to bringing that to reality over time.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. Thank you so much for the color.\nRebecca J. Kujawa: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Closing Remarks]",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rebecca J. Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year. Both the principal businesses executed well on major initiatives and we continue to advance our opportunity set for new renewables and storage. Building upon the solid progress made in the first half of the year, NextEra Energy is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for 2021 and beyond. Earlier this month, we were honored to be named on Fortune's 2021 Change the World list, the only electric utility in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy's best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities that we serve. At FPL, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior-year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business. Most notably, during the quarter, we reached what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement with a number of intervenors in our rate case, continuing a long history of negotiated outcomes that benefit both customers and shareholders. We believe the agreement, if approved, should enable us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently while investing in the future to ensure resilience, reliability, affordability and clean energy for generations to come in Florida. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at its agenda conference on October 26, and I'll provide more details on the proposed agreement in a few minutes. FPL's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also had a great quarter of execution, and its strong year-to-date financial performance is attributable to continued successful implementation of the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we previously outlined. Gulf Power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior-year comparable period. And we remain focused on improving Gulf Power value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year. Our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatt to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in Energy Resources' history. These backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500 megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which I'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes. We continue to expect that our competitive advantages will drive meaningful growth in renewables and various forms of energy storage at Energy Resources in the coming years, as the trend toward broad decarbonization across many facets of the US economy takes hold. Overall, with three strong quarters complete in 2021, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy, and we are well positioned to achieve the full-year financial expectations that we have previously discussed subject to our usual caveats. Now, let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 2021. During the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of $597 million. As you know, much of the East Coast of the US was recently impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the Northeastern US. Our deepest sympathies are with those that have been impacted by Ida's widespread destruction. We value deeply the industry's commitment to mutual assistance and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share. Gulf Power's third quarter EPS contribution was flat versus the prior-year comparable quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the reversal of COVID-19 related expenses that had occurred earlier in that year. During the quarter, Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter and we expect its full-year capital investments to be roughly $800 million. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect Gulf Power's regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost effective zero emission solar capacity online within the next six months. The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across the two different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. These continued smart capital investments in renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. During the quarter, Gulf Power was impacted by Tropical Storm Fred, which experienced an unexpected change in path before striking the service territory. Through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, Gulf Power was able to restore its service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by Fred in Northwest Florida in less than 24 hours. Moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours. Our culture of preparation, including our annual storm drills and the team's focused execution helped ensure an efficient, timely and safe response to the tropical storm. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. Florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months reflecting the ongoing recovery, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. The real estate sector in Florida also continues to grow with a three-month average new housing starts up over 40% year-over-year. In August alone, there are -- there were twice as many new housing starts in Florida than in the average over the last 10 years. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%. As another indicator of Florida's economic health, Florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior-year comparable period. A decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior-year quarter. And Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably. As a reminder, on March 12th, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding for rate relief beginning in January of 2022. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early August with a number of intervenors in the proceeding. The Office of Public Counsel, The Florida Retail Federation, The Florida Industrial Power Users Group, The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Vote Solar, The CLEO Institute and The Federal Executive Agencies all joined the agreement, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base. The four-year proposed agreement, which begins on January 2022 provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown on the accompanying slide and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7%, and no change to FPL's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system. Should the average 30-year US Treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive six-month period during the term of the agreement, Florida Power & Light's allowed regulatory ROE would increase to 10.8% with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%. Additionally, if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed agreement, Florida Power & Light would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after review of the impacts on base revenue requirements. The proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the four-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus. Consistent with the rate plan filed in March, the proposed settlement agreement would unify the rates and tariffs of FPL and Gulf Power by implementing a five-year transition rider and credit mechanism to address the initial differences in cost of serving the existing FPL and Gulf Power customers. Additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. FPL would also be authorized to expand its SolarTogether voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current SolarTogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars over the lifetime of the assets. In addition to solar energy, the settlement agreement would support FPL's green hydrogen pilot project in Okeechobee County. This innovative technology could one day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day. The proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across Florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million. Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. FPL's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average. The proposed agreement would keep typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through 2025. Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively year-over-year. The effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' third quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses. All other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020, driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources' development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today. Through the three -- first three quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog. Energy Resources' backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts. At this early stage, we have made terrific progress toward our long-term development expectations with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post 2022 backlog. Our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500 megawatt wind project, the majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company. The project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facility's load requirements. The hydrogen manufactured by the facility would enable commercial and industrial end users to replace their current gray hydrogen and fossil fuel purchases with emissions-free green hydrogen, further accelerating the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors. Energy Resources also add nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in California, and we continue to experience significant demand from California based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions. We are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in California with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024, to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals. More than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in California and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free sustainable future. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter, Energy Resources entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of rate regulated water and wastewater utility assets in eight counties near Houston, Texas. The proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022. Energy Resources is also currently in construction on an innovative water reuse and reclamation project that would help our customer achieve significant savings on its water supply needs and make its operations more efficient and sustainable while at the same time, delivering attractive returns to Energy Resources. While the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from corporate and other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.54 and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high-end of this range. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations so far for the year, we expect the fourth quarter results to include impacts from certain liability management activities that we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. Looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023. Our earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which performed well and delivered third quarter results generally in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top-end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners continues to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. In addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100 megawatt operating wind asset in California from a third party to further expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility. The project is located in a strategic market with strong expected growth in renewables demand, and it also offers significant optionality to NextEra Energy Partners in terms of operational savings and long-term value creation. NextEra Energy Partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. NextEra Energy Partners expects to recapitalize this project finance debt in 2022 as it executes on its overall financing plan for the year. We expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close later this year or in 2022. Following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on a five-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. NextEra Energy Partners continues to leverage its competitive advantages to be successful in third-party M&A and extend its long runway of growth. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2022 run rate expectations, which are built upon its strong existing portfolio cash generation and continued ability to access low cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. Now, let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party, contributed $23 million. Existing assets contributed $7 million, primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource. Wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower solar resource in the third quarter of this year. Cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year, primarily as a result of lower year-over-year PAYGO payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners recapitalized its Genesis Solar project and other existing assets at the end of last year and the impact of this new project level financing cost versus the prior year was offset by an associated reduction in corporate level interest expense as reflected in our other category. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. On a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively. And NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. We expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. By year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million. At the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations. These growth rates are supported by our strong execution against our long-term growth objectives in 2021, including opportunistic third-party transactions that were not previously in our plan. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. Finally, during the quarter, S&P updated its ratings methodology for NextEra Energy Partners. And in particular, it will now evaluate NextEra Energy Partners debt metrics on a funds from operations or FFO to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-EBITDA basis. We believe that the combination of S&P's updated methodology, its assessment of NextEra Energy Partners improving diversity and its use of less conservative assumptions in the portfolios and renewable generation cash flows will allow for several hundred million dollars more of financing flexibility relative to our previous assumptions, providing the partnership with even greater flexibility going forward to finance accretive acquisition for the benefit of our unitholders. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Thank you, Julien. I appreciate the questions, and good morning. As you even prefaced in your set of questions, we're pretty excited about the opportunities for both of the major businesses, both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources. And specifically on the renewable side and Energy Resources, the team just had an awesome origination quarter, and that's kind of on the heels of other awesome origination quarters going back now for quite some time, setting us up for tremendous growth in the coming years. So in terms of demand backdrop, to kind of answer the second question first, it's terrific, and we're really excited about the value proposition of renewables looking forward, both in terms of being low cost and the ability to decarbonize both the electricity sector and other sectors as we've talked about. It's been an exciting 18 months for our integrated supply chain and engineering construction teams. Lots of opportunities to navigate uncertainties, likes of which we and the industry probably haven't seen in quite some time. And it's also in the midst of enormous growth for us, a record year of renewables deployment last year and another terrific capital deployment year this year, so both growth and opportunities to show what we can do. It's good to be us. I mean, we've highlighted that in the past in the sense of being large in this industry, having significant capital dollars to put to work, enables us to have strong relationships and extensive relationships with those in the supply chain to help navigate these uncertainties. We feel good about our ability to navigate them. The plan does get iterated from time to time as the circumstances change, but we feel good about the long-term view for renewables and our ability to deliver on our expectations. Yes, prefer not to, Steve. We're obviously really excited about the opportunity to supply them and provide this energy, and we think it is a great start to the hydrogen economy. But we'll leave that discussion for a later date. Not meaningfully. I appreciate the question. No, nothing that I would consider to be meaningful at all. There's a couple of projects that moved out and a couple of projects that moved in, in terms of time frames, but very much consistent with our expectations. And as I highlighted at a very high level in response to Julien's question, we feel good about our plans of bringing in the projects we expect to bring into service in 2021 and have good line of sight for executing on the development plans thereafter. No, it's a contract with the customer irrespective of any sort of subsequent policy changes. Thank you, Steve. Good morning, Shar. Shar, I'm not sure I'm following completely the question. Are you asking whether or not there are other projects -- not our projects, but other projects that might be experiencing those? Or are you asking for us? Because I wasn't sure who the buyers were in that -- in your question. We are not having any -- anything notable from a buyer perspective. And from our customers' perspective, we have a contract, and we are expecting to execute against what's laid out in those contracts. And from a supply chain standpoint, I think, we're very well positioned to navigate these uncertainties. And as I highlighted, line of sight of bringing out the projects that we intend to bring in in '21 into service and have great plans for executing against our '22 development program. And obviously, beyond that, one, there's a lot still to be seen as to what those conditions will ultimately be because now we're talking two-plus years out. But a great team and a great position in the industry to be able to navigate those. From a customer standpoint, we're continuing to see strong demand for new renewables. I think that's obvious from the contract signings that we were able to announce today, and John and his team have terrific backlog beyond that of opportunities that we have yet to sign and the team is really excited about being out in the field and talking with our customers. It is just a terrific time for renewables in our industry. Sure, Shar. And obviously, we continue to work diligently at now what's going to be FPL going forward, particularly assuming the settlement agreement is approved next week by the commission, Gulf will be fully incorporated into the broader FPL enterprise. It largely is today, but obviously, from a regulatory standpoint, operates separately at least through the end of this year. We think there are continued opportunities to focus on optimization across the businesses. That's part of what we do as a company, is look for those opportunities to take opportunities to bring efficiencies to the business, and of course, invest capital to take cost out and lower fuel costs over time. One of the great ways that FPL, and that includes Gulf as part of it, will be to continue to deploy solar over the long term, because as you all well know, not only does it have the clean energy benefits, but it has low operating costs and no fuel costs, which will be a great offset in diversification in the state of Florida from our existing generation set. So I think there's continued opportunities. There's still a lot of work to be done. We focus hard on that every day and we think the team is all the cards in the hand to be able to continue executing. Yes. So Shar, I would think if you look back at where we have taken the opportunity to invest capital historically, it really is on bringing long-term value to our customers. So being able to deliver lower cost over time, higher reliability, greater resilience, greater diversification and those clean energy benefits, and it would be short-sighted to stop investing in opportunities that are really clearly good for customers. We're very mindful of customer bills. You hear that from us from every day -- in all of our communications and it's what we focus on day to day, is making sure we have a terrific value proposition for our customers, and we will do everything we can to moderate those impacts over time. Thank you. Hey, Michael, and good morning, and thanks for the question. We did include in the prepared remarks, the comment about the $45 million, and that $45 million includes both the acquisition of the regulated utility assets as well as that innovative water reuse and reclamation project that we talked about it also on Energy Resources. So in terms of our capital program, investing $15 billion a year and more over time, it's pretty small. But we referenced it for a good reason, and that's because we're excited about the opportunities. I think it's a lot like transmission in the sense that it will be built slowly over time and create opportunities for us to continue to have that regulated and long-term contracted base of value creation for shareholders. On the other part, the kind of innovative use and reclamation project that we talked about on the Energy Resources side, those also bring clean energy renewable opportunities as we're able to bring this broad suite of clean energy and ESG focused investment opportunities for our commercial and industrial customers. That gives us the opportunity to have a deep relationship with them, not just bring one solution, but bring a portfolio of options to them. So we think it's a terrific opportunity for Energy Resources team to develop those meaningful relationships with our customers. So it's both an investment and a strategic opportunity from our perspective. Yes. So we have an ongoing hedging program that we execute ratably over time, executing a percentage of Seabrook's forward generation. So I would characterize it as pretty well hedged in the next couple of years. And then as you get out into the latter part of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, less so. So it obviously would benefit that -- if you mark-to-market that forward position, clearly, there's been some upside with the increase in natural gas prices and some of the congestion you've seen in the Northeast in terms of electricity prices. Whether that lasts in the long term, I think, remains to be seen, but certainly an opportunity for Seabrook. We continue to believe Seabrook is very well placed. It is in a particularly advantageous load zone. It's obviously in a region that values clean energy deeply. And you think about broad decarbonization in any part of the US, including the Northeast, well-positioned nuclear assets will be a key part of making that happen. So we very much appreciate the -- our nuclear team and think they do a terrific job every day and Seabrook is a key part of that. Thank you, Michael. So I'll come back to the second question. In terms of the transaction, as we highlighted, it was a third-party transaction, so it reflects a negotiated outcome. And we continue to believe that the renewable sector remains of high interest for a lot of folks and expect it to be competitive over time. But I think you can see with this transaction and with a prior third-party transaction that we announced and closed earlier this year, there are some specific advantages that NextEra Energy Partners has, both in its ability to find attractive financing, but also the relationship it has with NextEra Energy Resources of being able to add value on the operating side and bring to bear all of the scale benefits that we have. So in terms of the second part of the question, I think you were asking about the 2018 CEPF, and ultimately, the conversion that will happen in the very latter part of this year. And we're still -- obviously, some significant part of that gets converted up to 70% of it in NEP units and the balance is paid in cash. And we are still working through what the full impacts are and how we will finance that over time. But as we've laid out in terms of our run rate expectations, we will expect that year-end '22 to be in the ranges that we outlined today. Thank you. Yes, I think it's a great question. As we've highlighted -- I highlighted, obviously, in the prepared remarks, and Jim has highlighted elsewhere in recent months, we're really excited about building a significant presence in the water business. And we think there's a lot of skills and capabilities, and of course, the broad platform we have that we could bring real value in these acquisitions. But as you highlighted, they tend to be very small, and whether they're privately owned or owned by municipalities, almost irregardless of the ownership structure, they tend to be small. Even the one I talked about today is incorporated with something else, and it totals up $45 million in context of our $15 billion capital program. So I expect us to be active. There's probably some regions of the US, where the team in the near term, will be more active than others for a variety of reasons, but it's probably not exclusively Texas and it will build over time. And we'll let you know if the team continues to have success. Thank you. Good morning. I think it's a great question. I think in the electricity sector, when it's going to be particularly relevant is the latter part of the 2020s into 2030s and beyond. And for the key reason for that being that you really need to have the need for long-duration storage, and it is particularly attractive when you have very, very low cost energy input, and particularly, low cost renewables, which will inevitably have when you have substantial renewable deployment, again, probably in the latter part of the 2020s and beyond. What may be different is in the transportation and industrial sector, where there's already built-in use of gray hydrogen and other fossil fuels that could be supplanted with green hydrogen when it's competitive. The big question mark would be whether or not there's a hydrogen production tax credit ultimately in the final reconciliation bill. Clearly, there's one anticipated today, and at $3 a kilogram production tax credit, that really closes the gap between gray hydrogen and green hydrogen alternatives. And so that's a terrific opportunity to see growth in the near term, and what that would represent is using green hydrogen alternatives to supplant gray hydrogen. From our perspective, that opportunity is clearly to build a lot of renewables and you saw the first step in that direction in our announcement today about a power purchase agreement that we've entered into. But there would be more -- a lot more like that in not just the renewable side, but also an opportunity for us to invest in the actual hydrogen production equipment such as the electrolyzer. So we'll see. We'll know a lot more in January once we've seen the final package, if there is one, as Jim highlighted and it will develop over time in terms of opportunities. We think it's exceptionally likely. It's really just a matter of timing. Yes. We're really excited about transmission opportunities. Our NextEra Energy Transmission team has built a terrific business over the last decade with a number of organic wins as well as some acquisitions, as we've talked about in the past of, not only Trans Bay Cable, but GridLiance more recently, and we see a ton of opportunities going forward for us to be successful in winning some of those big opportunities to invest, realizing great returns, but also the strategic side of it of ensuring that it happens so that we can continue to realize the substantial renewables build-out that we already are seeing, and we expect to only continue to grow in this opportunity size over time. It may not be imperative today to have new transmission, but it's really, really important to start today because it will be imperative in the next decade and some of the policy considerations that FERC is undertaking today could be helpful to bringing that to reality over time. Great. Thank you."

            "name": "James L. Robo",
            "content": "Hey, Julien. Just -- The only thing I'd add is I think people don't really appreciate the 10-year strip is up $1 since January. It's hugely positive for the renewable business, enormously positive, right? So -- So Steve, it's Jim. I would say that we remain cautiously optimistic that something happens on that front. I think I said earlier, if there is a reconciliation bill, I would be shocked if there isn't a long-term extension of the credits embedded in that. And I think that's reasonably high odds if the Democrats can come to terms among themselves around what would be in the reconciliation bill. And that's not an easy -- as we've seen play out over the last several weeks, that's not an easy -- that's not easy and there's, obviously, within that, that caught us [Phonetic] a lot of varying views across the board. But I think -- so I remain cautiously optimistic that something happens there. And then if something happens there, we feel good about the fact that there will be a long-term extension of the credits and that there will be support for other types of clean energy such as hydrogen, a stand-alone storage ITC, etc. So, yes, it would be very constructive for us. We think it's an important part of the decarbonization of the US economy to accelerate that. And I mean, we've increasingly -- as we think about our own strategy going forward, we're increasingly thinking about ourselves as the company that's going to lead not only the clean energy transformation of the electric grid, but really the clean energy transformation of the US economy and the decarbonization of the US economy because the electric grid is going to be the key to decarbonizing the transport sector, it's going to be the key to decarbonizing the industrial sector. And so we're really positioning ourselves to be the leader there and I feel very good about both the policy tailwinds that we have as well as how our business is executing along those goals."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nJessica Aldridge: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power and Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted, or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Jessica. And good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased more than 9% year-over-year reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.04 year-over-year driven by continued investments in the business. FPL's major capital initiatives remain on track and FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. In June, FPL demolished its last coal fired plant in Florida with plans to replace it with more clean emissions free solar energy facilities. During the quarter, FPL also successfully commissioned approximately 373 megawatts of new solar, including the FPL Discovery Solar Energy Center at Kennedy Space Center. With these new additions FPL surpassed 40% completion of its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030. FPL expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022, which would put the company more than 50% on the way towards completing a 30 by 30 plan. And just over three years since the initial announcement. To support its solar build out, FPL recently began installing the first components of the world's largest integrated solar powered battery system. The 409 megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center which expected to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also continued to execute on its growth initiatives during the quarter with its strong financial performance driven primarily by continued investment in the business and further improvements in operational cost effectiveness. Excluding the COVID-19 related expenses which were subsequent reversed and booked into a regulatory asset in the third quarter of 2020, Gulf Power's year-to-date O&M costs declined by approximately 9% versus the prior year comparable period, and have now declined by approximately 31% relative to 2018. Gulf Power's operational performance metrics also continue to improve with reliability of the generation fleet that we operate, and service reliability improving by 71% and 63% respectively, year-to-date versus the first half of 2018. We continue to expect the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we've previously outlined will generate significant customer and shareholder value in the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 7% year-over-year. The energy resources team continues to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low cost renewables and storage, adding approximately 1840 megawatts to its backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success is a testament to Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages, including our large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power and supply chain execution, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world class operations capability. Moreover, Energy Resources Advanced Data analytics and machine learning capabilities allow us to utilize the nearly 40 billion operating data points our fleet provides every single day for predictive modeling, further extending our best-in-class O&M and development capabilities. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. We are pleased with the progress we've made at NextEra Energy so far in 2021. And headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $819 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $70 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.7% over the same quarter last year, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2021. During the quarter, we utilized $100 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $473 million. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $240 million in hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs, in 2019, FPL utilized its available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory assets related to Dorian cost recovery. Earlier in the year FPL and Office of Public council entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of FPL\u2019s hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in May.  We were pleased by the Commission's determination that all of FPL hurricane Dorian restoration costs were prudently incurred, and we believe the settlement agreement fairly and reasonably balances the interests of FPL and its customers. Earlier this month, FPL responded to tropical storm Elsa, with a restoration workforce of approximately 7,000 FPL employees and contractors. FPL safely and quickly restored power to nearly 100,000 customers who were impacted by Elsa as the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient energy grid continued to benefit customers. Elsa was the earliest that a fifth named storm has formed in the Atlantic basin. And we remain prepared in advance of what is forecasted to be another active hurricane season in 2021. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2021 net income of $63 million or $0.03 per share. During the quarter Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expected full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of the major capital with the Gulf Power capital projects, including the North Florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid 2022 continue to progress well and Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 17% year-over-year as a result of these smart capital investments for the benefit of customers. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 2021. For the full year 2021, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. Earlier this month, Florida Public Service Commission also approved a settlement agreement between Gulf Power and the Office of Public Council for cost recovery of the approximately $13 million in COVID-19 related expenses, primarily reflected in incremental bad debt and safety expenses as a result of the pandemic. We are pleased with this outcome and believe it demonstrates the continued constructive regulatory environment in the state of Florida, as we work to improve Gulf Power's customer value proposition of low costs, high reliability, excellent customer service and clean energy for our customers. As we anticipated, Florida's economic activity has rebounded since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, as reflected by a wide range of positive economic indicators. Florida's current unemployment rate is 5%, which remains well below the national average. Rolling three month average of new building permits are up approximately 46% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate in nearly eight years, and are the second highest new building permits in the nation. As another indicator of health in Florida's economy, Florida's retail sales index was up over 40% versus the prior year. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices is up over 14% on an annual basis. Recent population growth estimates indicate that Florida remains one of the top destinations for relocating Americans, with Florida adding nearly 330,000 new residents between April of 2020 and April of 2021. We expect this trend to continue, with Florida's population projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1% through 2023 and FPL, including Gulf Power forecasts adding almost 500,000 new customer accounts from 2018 through 2025. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 70,400 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 2.1% from the prior year comparable period. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.8%. On weather normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 2.9% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power the average number of customers grew roughly 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter, and Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales decreased 1% year-over-year, as strong customer growth was more than offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2020. As we previously stated on March 12, we initiated Florida Power and Light 2021 base rate proceeding. The four year base rate plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in clean energy generation, long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and keeps customer bills low. Today FPL typical residential bills remain well below the national average and the lowest among the top 20 investor owned utilities in the nation. With a proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average, and typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the four year rate plan. As always we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through our fair settlement agreement. And our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $315 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $574 million or $0.29 per share. Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period. The effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges which is excluded from adjusted earnings was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.04 per share versus the prior year and primarily reflect growth in our contract of renewables and battery storage program. Adjusted earnings per share contributions from existing generation and storage assets increased $0.01 year-over-year, which includes the impact of unfavorable wind resource during second quarter. NextEra Transmissions adjusted earnings per share contribution also increased $0.01 year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.3 lower year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. All other impacts decreased results by $0.01 per share versus 2020. The Energy Resources Development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the second quarter, with a team adding approximately 1,840 megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we've added approximately 285 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 megawatts of solar and 105 megawatts of battery storage to our backlog assign contracts. With nearly 3.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have already signed more than 75% of the megawatts needed to realize the low end of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. Since the last call, we have also executed a 310 megawatt build own transfer agreement which is not included in our backlog additions. Our customer intends to use this solar-plus-storage project to replace existing coal generation. And we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation into clean, reliable and low cost renewables and storage. Our engineering and construction team continues to perform exceptionally well commissioning approximately 330 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the backlog of wind, solar and storage projects that we expect to build in 2021 and 2022 on track. We are well positioned to complete our more than $20 billion capital investment program at Energy Resources for 2021 and 2022. Last month, the IRS extended safe harbor eligibility on production tax credits and investment tax credits. Providing projects that began construction between 2016 and 2019 with six years to complete construction and projects that started construction in 2020 with five years to achieve their in service dates and qualify for federal tax credits. We believe the extension reflects the strong support of the Biden administration for new renewables and may enable an incremental 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of new wind and wind repowering opportunities. We now have more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the second quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $256 million or $0.13 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.4 billion and $0.71 cents per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. Over the past few months NextEra Energy issued nearly $3.3 billion in new financings under its innovative new NextEra Green bond structure. Funds raised with NextEra Energy green bonds are designated for specific renewable energy and storage projects under development across our businesses. And if funds are not used to bring the renewable projects online within two years, there was a step up in the interest rate on the debt. Our inaugural NextEra Green issuance was 4.5x oversubscribed, priced at a premium to the market and was well received by investors.  We believe that NextEra Green will set a new standard for green issuances moving forward. NextEra Energy has raised more than $9 billion in new capital year-to-date on very favorable terms as we continue to execute on our financing plan for the year. Finally, in June, S&P affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its Funds From Operation or FFO to debt metric, from the previous level of 21% to the new level of 20%. We believe this favorable adjustment reflects the strength of our business, as well as recognition of NextEra Energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors on environmental, social and governance or ESG factors. We believe this is the first time that S&P has formally recognized the benefits to business risk profile related to ESG factors by allowing more constructive financial metrics since it began its practice of identifying the specific ESG key metrics that drive a company's overall credit position. Notably, S&P also revised NextEra Energy's management and governance assessment, from satisfactory to strong to reflect its views on our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management standards, and successful track record of consistently implementing our strategic planning efforts.  Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021 NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022, and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year to at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to an NextEra Energy Partners, NextEra Energy Partners portfolio performed well and deliver financial results are generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below average renewable resource. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 11%, respectively, versus 2020. This strong operational and financial performance highlights the NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution $0.6625 per common unit or $2.65 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 250% since the IPO.  Further building on that strength, today we are announcing the NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from NextEra Energy Resources. I'll provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes. NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financing during second quarter to secure funding for its recently announced 2021 acquisitions and further enhance its financing flexibility. In June, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes and concurrently entered into a capped call structure that is expected to result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining the upside from up to 50% appreciation in its unit price over the three years associated with a convertible notes. NextEra Energy Partners also drew the remaining funds from its 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which was upsized by approximately $150 million during the quarter evidencing continued investor demand for exposure to the high quality long term contract of renewables projects and the underlying portfolio of assets that was established last year. Finally, NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed the sale of approximately 700,000 NEP common units year-to-date through its recently expired at the market or ATM program, raising roughly $50 million in proceeds. Going forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations. And in the near term NextEra Energy Partners intends to renew the program for up to $300 million in issuances over the next three years to permit additional financing flexibility. As a result of these financings, and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 599 megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources, as well as previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA $350 million was roughly flat versus the prior year comparable quarter driven by favorable contributions from the approximately 500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects acquired in 2020. Weaker wind and solar resource in this second quarter, which reduced this quarters adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects by roughly $22 million was partially offset by positive contributions to adjusted EBITDA from last year's repowering and the Texas pipelines. Wind resource for the quarter was 93% of the long-term average versus 100% in the second quarter of 2020. Cash available for distribution of $151 million for the second quarter was also reduced for existing projects due to the distributions for the convertible equity portfolio financing entered into late last year. As a reminder, this convertible equity portfolio financing recapitalize NextEra Energy Partners' existing Genesis solar project and other assets, and the proceeds were used to fund last year's acquisition from Energy Resources. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. We remain on track for the strong full year growth consistent with our long-term growth objectives of 12% to 15% distributions per unit growth through at least 2024. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. The portfolio consists of approximately 830 megawatts of renewables, of which NextEra Energy Partners will be acquiring an approximately 590 megawatt net interest. NextEra Energy Partners' interest in the portfolio will consist of approximately 510 megawatts of universal scale wind and solar projects, and approximately 80 megawatts of distributed solar projects, which is NextEra Energy Partners' first acquisition of distributed generation assets. The portfolio to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners has a cash available for distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 17 years and a counterparty credit rating of Baa1 at Moody's and BBB at S&P. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Energy Resources currently owns the country's largest portfolio of distributed generation assets with commercial and industrial customers, and expects to triple its capital investment and distributed generation from 2020 through 2020. NextEra Energy Partners expects to benefit from this expansion over the coming years through future acquisitions from Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a total consideration of $563 million subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEra Energy Partners' share of the portfolio's debt and tax equity financings is estimated to be approximately $270 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million to $100 million, and cash available for distribution of approximately $41 million to $49 million, each on five year average annual run rate basis beginning on December 31 2021. The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded with existing liquidity, and the transaction is expected to close prior to year end and be immediately accretive to LP distributions.  NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and capped the expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats, and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022, to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At NextEra Energy we were honored to be named on Time magazine's first ever list of Top 100 most influential companies, which highlights businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transformation in our sector and remained focused on executing upon the opportunities presented by the significant growth in wind, solar and various forms of energy storage in the US over the coming decades. At FPL, including Gulf Power, that means continuing to deliver on our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions. At Energy Resources, our competitive advantages, position as well to capture a meaningful share of the significant and expanding market for renewables. And at NextEra Energy Partners with its continued access to low cost capital, and accretive acquisition opportunities, is well positioned as ever to take advantage of the clean energy transformation, reshaping the energy industry. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\nSharPourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question with sort of the infrastructure discussions going on at the federal level and obviously, Rebecca, you highlighted opportunities on the wind and solar side. Does NextEra transmissions sort of seeing the upside from policy changes? And obviously, with the prior acquisitions closed, do you feel like you have a big enough platform to grow organically or is there an interest to roll up more standalone projects development entities?\nRebeccaKujawa: Yes, thanks, Shar. Appreciate the question. From our perspective, and we're looking out decades and looking at the enormous renewables build opportunity across the US. It is clear that over time new transmission needs to be built to support some of that build out. And it's not necessarily imperative today for that transmission to be built. But it certainly is important to start today to build the type of infrastructure that's needed over time. So we're really excited about the opportunities that the NextEra Energy Transmission team has. And I would expect over time that we will grow both organically and continue to look for acquisition opportunities, like we have over the last couple of years to supplement and build out that portfolio. We're thrilled with the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that we closed a couple of years ago, very excited to bring the GridLiance team on board and will continue to focus on opportunities, both organically and through acquisition over time.  From a broader policy standpoint, we saw that important for FERC the regional ISOs to continue to focus on how you support that transmission build out. And we certainly are happy to see that to start to be a focus at FERC this year in particular, and contemplating how do they support it going forward. And I think there's a receptive audience in the Biden administration, making sure that they support laying a foundation that supportive of renewables, not just in the next couple of years, but in the next couple of decades. So transmission moves slowly, you know that. So stay tuned. But we're optimistic both about our direct prospects in the near term as well as longer term.\nSharPourreza: Got it. And then the backlog additions look obviously more solid this quarter. Just thinking about maybe the market dynamics, there was some slowdown in early '21 with input costs and commodity inflation, right. Have you seen that or are the headwinds largely stabilized? And just as a follow up, is energy storage, still kind of a large component of the backlog and contracted additions or has there been some pricing pressure there?\nRebeccaKujawa: Our Energy Resources Development team clearly as evidenced by not only the signings this quarter, but looking back at quarters now going back quite a number of them have just had terrific origination success. And I've encouraged everybody to not just focus on an individual quarter and look at a slightly broader trend. And we're really pleased not only with what we've seen looking back and what the team has been able to execute on, but also looking forward. And that's what gave us the confidence just early this year, to not only increase but expand the horizon for our development expectations, such that our four year period starting '21 through '24 is 23 to 30 gigawatts, which is just an exceptional number and one that we're really excited and proud of the team for taking on and we're thrilled to be at 75% already at the low end today. In terms of our customer demand remains very strong across the board, and we're certainly excited about bringing that into more signed contracts going forward. In terms of costs, as you know, we'll continue to incorporate our latest expectations and industry's latest expectations for costs. And we feel very comfortable with the returns that we see and excited about the opportunities going forward. \nSharPourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, regarding just the rate case, I mean, obviously, you're having conversations with interveners and you're building a case record there and obviously highlighted you always prefer a settlement. Are there any moving pieces that you feel are in focus? And what do you sort of think you have some flexibility for a constructive kind of outcome versus a fully litigated case?\nRebeccaKujawa: Shar, as we've talked about with you all, from an investor standpoint, we're very focused over years now leading up to the case as a matter of our strategy making sure that the best customer value proposition possible, and you can see that in our execution on O&M, or reliability on customer service. And, of course, the continued focused on clean energy generation, because that's in our control. What's also in our control is putting forward the best case possible to ensure that we're articulating that strategy, not only what the team has accomplished, but what we plan to do in the coming four years to support continued execution. So the team is very focused on continuing to go through the process. And culminating with the hearings, in short order and commission decision later this year if we go that far. But we're also always very interested in having a win-win solution with stakeholders. We certainly appreciate the history of that in Florida, not just with us, but with other utilities and broader stakeholder base. And we will continue to remain very engaged and any sort of constructive outcome that we could bring forward with stakeholders, we think that's positive for our customers and broader stakeholders, if we can accomplish it, but we're focused on the task at hand and we'll continue through the process and see where we are at the end of the year. \nSharPourreza: Perfect. Congrats guys on the results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from BOA. \nJulienSmith: Excellent. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Maybe picking up where Shar left it off. Can you speak a little bit more about some of this inflation dynamic? And especially some of the elevated freight and logistics? I mean, it seems like your '21, '22 outlook here is relatively intact? Can you speak to some of the dynamics there in and just the competence? It seems like you guys are certainly staying on track of execution that you have historically. But also in the same vein of inflation, can you speak to what that does to your PPA offtake prices, right? I mean, how are you thinking about this being effectively passed through to your customers, if you will, whether that's as a proxy for higher gas and power prices, or simply just passing through your higher cost of goods here?\nRebeccaKujawa: Yes, thanks, Julien. And I'll start with some kind of near term thoughts. And then think about the broader term second, near term, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we feel very comfortable with where we are with our backlog and what we plan to build in the 2021 and 2022 timeframe. And our comments reflected that in the prepared remarks. And it's a real credit to the way that we approach this business, and our engineering, construction and integrated supply chain teams are really working through a variety of different circumstances over the last year and a half. And we've secured the equipment that we need to build out those projects and of course have some contractual agreements in place that help us feel comfortable about acquisition. From a longer term standpoint, I think it still remains to be seen in some respects. So you can see that in broad set of discussion across the financial and the broader US economy, dialogue of whether or not this is temporary related to near term snapbacks in demand and hurdles in the supply chain that may not persist over time, or if it is systemic and persisting. So I think that remains a little bit to be seen. One thing that's very fortunate for renewables, as you all well know, is that renewable energy projects are very much the least cost form of generation in many parts, if not most of parts of the US. So even if there is a change in pricing, if these cost increases are persistent and systemic over a long period of time, the value proposition is still very clear for renewables relative to alternatives. And then beyond that, we also need to think about what implications if any there will be from policy changes. So I think that the net takeaway is somewhat premised in your question is that we feel comfortable with where we are, we're prepared for a variety of set of circumstances. And we're thrilled with a position of renewables and the growth opportunities. And honestly, the decades ahead.\nJohnKetchum: One small add, I would I would make to listen to what Rebecca just said. This is John; it's actually creating opportunities for us. Our supply chain capability and our ability to manage that supply chain, the buying power, that we have spent an $11 billion in CapEx a year, it's creating opportunities for us in the renewable space because we can execute deliver where others can't.\nJulienSmith: I mean, to that point, can you speak to how much procurement you all have done against the full kind of full year outlook that you guys talk about here? I mean, how hedged up, for lack of a better way to describe this, are you against these eventualities? And I know you all do meaningful forward planning here.\nJohnKetchum: Yes, pretty well hedged up Julien, I mean, we've basically locked in, obviously '21, we've locked in '22, making really good headway against '23, as well. And so that's put us in a great position, when you look at where we stand against the rest of the market, and where others can't deliver particularly around commitments in '22, or '23, or '24. Because they don't have the same supply chain leverage that we do. It's really creating opportunities in those out years. And you got to remember, the customers a little bit concerned. So if they're dealing with smaller players, that don't have the same supply chain leverage, that are having to constantly go back to them for price ups, or for COD extensions, it really lowers the credibility of those types of players and market, and it creates more opportunities that fall our way. And so that's why I say it's a real opportunity for us.\nJulienSmith: Got it. And just to clarify that even further, or are you suggesting that not only could you get awarded future contracts, are you suggesting that you might be able to take over existing or perhaps the fund PPAS that have already been awarded?\nJohnKetchum: Not take over. But if those opportunities fall away, because the off take where the customer can't arrange or workout with that developer. Sometimes those are -- those get bid back out to RFP or sometimes it creates a bilateral opportunity for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.\nSteveFleishman: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me Rebecca? Great. So first question on the announced backlog growth this quarter, lot of solar adds. But just a little bit of storage. Are you seeing, if I recall, you've been getting kind of 50% roughly adoption of storage with solar, is that changing? Just happened to be more just solar standalone weighted this quarter?\nRebeccaKujawa: Yes, Steve, I wouldn't read into it. To kind of consistent with the overall backlog additions, I think you'd need to look a little bit broader in just a three month period to get an indication of trends. What we see is not a slowdown in storage at all, there's a lot of interest in new storage opportunities, not just with our customers, but even from a regulatory standpoint in certain jurisdictions where storage could be particularly helpful given certain dynamics in various markets. So we're very excited about the storage opportunity and don't see a change in the overall dynamics as of opportunities.\nJohnKetchum: Yes, and one thing I would add to that Steve is, with all the hot weather that you're seeing out in the West, that's only going to drive more storage opportunity and I think we have a real competitive advantage as you seen the past in those markets.\nSteveFleishman: Okay, great, and maybe just switching over to NEP. So this is the second drop, I think in the last six months or so, where the capped yields have been around 8% is that kind of the new range we should be expecting for NEP on drops of one term contracted asset.\nRebeccaKujawa: Steve, you can appreciate we and of course, the NEP board and Energy Resources perspectives all constantly looking at what valuations are and where third party transactions have transacted and we think about the valuations in those light. And I think with where costs of capital are and demands for renewable projects, I think this transaction appropriately balances and reflects those dynamics.\nSteveFleishman: Okay. And I guess last question just on any thoughts on some of the discussion in ERCOT, Texas on renewables on market structure changes, and then how they're discussing kind of treatment of renewables there. I mean is there a risk that renewables need to end up paying for ancillaries?\nRebeccaKujawa: I would characterize it Steve as a work in progress. Obviously, the events that happened in February were pretty significant. And it takes time to work through and properly account for where there were sources of pressure and what the appropriate responses are, from obviously, from a political but of course, most probably from regulatory and a policy standpoint. And I think they're still sorting through it. Obviously, Governor Abbott has asked for certain actions to be taken for the PUCT and ERCOT. And there's a framework that the PUCT has started to lay out. But I think it's still time to work through what those details look like. From our perspective you know well, we've been very active in a variety of aspects in ERCOT, we know that market well. And we certainly have a strong perspective on what needs to be addressed in particular to focus on what really went wrong in February, including a massive amount of disruption across the gas supply, not only from supply, but transmission and ultimately, consumption by end users. And we hope that a lot of the actions will be focused on that, as opposed to things that that won't necessarily help and solve the fundamental problems at hand. But I think the most important part is work in progress.\nJohnKetchum: Yes. And I think what I would add to that is trying to frame the problem, right, you have an 82 gigawatts system, I mean, renewables, let's face it, we're a very small part of that. On a MCF adjusted basis during your, you're talking about three gigawatts. And it really the way that to address the problem, if you're really going to go after the problem, you really have to focus on gas fired units, you have to focus on coal, you have to focus on nuclear. And you can't lose sight of the fact that the reason that ERCOT has low power prices, is because of renewables and renewables are what are really driving the efficiencies and the economics of that market. So there's a much bigger story to be told. That's what we're working through at the workshop level, as Rebecca said; this is going to take some time to play out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley.\nStephenByrd: Hi, good morning. I wanted to talk about the outlook for renewable and energy storage costs. But take it from a different perspective. I know there's been a lot of attention on commodity cost dynamics. But on the more positive side, I was interested in your views on sort of innovations that could result in cost reduction breakthroughs. And there was an interesting article this week in the Wall Street Journal in storage. And we're trying to make sure we're thinking through potential areas of innovation. I was just curious at a high level, are there areas of innovation, whether it be in storage, or in solar, green hydrogen, just things that excite you in terms of the potential to have very significant impacts on cost or performance?\nRebeccaKujawa: Well you know all of us, Steven, we love technology; we love innovation. And we certainly are excited about a lot of changes that are happening across the energy sector. I think the biggest driver dynamic in our sector today is really the cost of renewables overall, even today. And that alone is stimulating a significant amount of change. And that adoption over time, will create the need for more storage, like applications, whether it's lithium ion, or I think the technology you are referencing in the Wall Street Journal, of course, hydrogen in the longer term, which we're also very excited about. Those were all very interesting, particularly for the latter part of the 2020s and into 2030 and beyond, which could help support the substantial build up that we're expecting in the short term, I think the biggest dynamic is what we see at hand, which is the economic value proposition of renewables. What we think could change that probably near term than even some of the innovations you're talking about is policy. You all I know are following just like we are in participating in a variety of discussions in Washington. But if the incentives are addressed in legislation, that could be a big driver of change in the industry as well, in terms of timing.\nStephenByrd: That's very helpful. And then I wanted to go back to the drop down that you announced, I was just curious, what was the amount of gains to NextEra from the drop down of assets down to NEP?\nRebeccaKujawa: I'm not sure I understand the question, Stephen. Are you talking about the proceeds?\nStephenByrd: Oh, well, the proceeds relative to the cost of developing, I was just curious sort of what degree of a premium NextEra was able to achieve relative to the costs of developing those assets?\nRebeccaKujawa: We haven't disclosed that yet, Stephen, as we go through the process, of course, we will update the financial statements, assuming that the transaction closes. But we are very pleased from an Energy Resources perspective with these projects consistent overall returns with the types of returns that we see across wind and solar and distributed generation projects. On the DG side, we continue to be very excited about the business in Energy Resources; the team has done a terrific job building it. And as I commented in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to triple the investment that we've made in the business, and those tend to be very attractive returns.\nStephenByrd: Understood, thanks. I was asking in part, I was just looking at the multiple of EBITDA and I mean, Steve Fleishman mentioned the cash capped yield that's 8%, it's not surprising, but the multiple EBITDA looked relatively low, but there may be some elements that I'm just missing.\nRebeccaKujawa: I don't think, I wouldn't think it was characterized in anything unusual, Steven, we're happy with the overall returns of the project. And I do think that the capped yields are reflective of market transactions that we see in the marketplace and really reflective of substantial demand for renewables. And we've said continue to be very excited about the prospects for NEP.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse.\nMaheepMandloi: Hey, thanks for taking questions. Just following on the NEP side, the spread the drop downs, the adjusted EBITDA and CAFD guidance remains unchanged. Is that because of timing or something else on that side?\nRebeccaKujawa: I'm sorry, was the guidance changed? What was the -- I missed that part?\nMaheepMandloi: Sure. The adjusted EBITDA and CAFD guidance is the same as last quarter. Just wondering if the new drop downs are accretive on 2022 levels.\nRebeccaKujawa: I understand now sorry about that. No, from our expectations, if you look at our guidance expectations, even at the end of last year, which is when we started talking about what the expectations for run rates at the end of this year, they were for an increase. This transaction was something that we were anticipating as part of our growth expectations. We do expect to be at the high end of the ranges as we've articulated for both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD for year end. \nMaheepMandloi: Got it. And in terms of additional drop downs, would this be comfortable for 2022 needs and it's a fair statement that you might need more drop downs for 2023 distribution growth?\nRebeccaKujawa: We will continue to be opportunistic. There's a lot of flexibility within the NEP portfolio, we continue to have a pretty low payout ratio. If you recall, about a year and a half ago, we took some actions to disperse the lever but also supplement the portfolio during the uncertainty of the PG&E bankruptcy and continue to have a relatively low payout ratio. One of the advantages of that is NextEra Energy Partners can be opportunistic in terms of meeting its distribution per unit growth targets of 12% to 15%, which is really the metric against for really managing and measuring the business to ensure that we can meet those expectations. We provide the expectations for run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD to give a sense of how we're expecting to achieve them. But there is flexibility and how we get there.\nMaheepMandloi: Got you. Thanks, Rebecca. Again, just maybe last one, for me. In terms of -- on the news development, and just given the recent cost pressures on the input side, just having that safe harbor helps meet any near term needs, as in are you using some of that $2.2 billion of safe harbor equipment upfront to avoid any higher costs in the near term.\nRebeccaKujawa: There's a lot of flexibility inherent to that safe harbor portfolio, but we see it mostly as an option to create the opportunity to realize the tax incentives. Just as we seen over the last couple of years, there have been extensions in terms of timeframes and even extensions in terms of the available percentage of the tax credit in the given period. So maintaining flexibility and optionality is our first priority. We continue to feel very comfortable with the 2021 and 2022 build being able to meet the equipment needs and ultimately bring them into service and timeframes that are very attractive from an Energy Resources perspective.\nJohnKetchum: Yes. I would think of the Safe Harbor extension as being certainly an incremental opportunity for us. One of the advantages that we have is we're always careful on how we manage our safe harbor vintaging. And we're fortunate because we were in good shape on our 2017 vintage portfolio. And so the Safe Harbor extension creates 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of opportunity for us on the wind side. And if I could come back just for one second on Stephen Byrd's question on the EBITDA multiples, the EBITDA multiples on this drop down were consistent with what we've done in the past. You got to remember, it always gets a little bit tricky with tax credits. You also have to remember that even after the sale the NEP we own again, NEE owns a good portion NEP we get the cash distributions, we get IDRS. When you take all that into account on EBITDA multiple basis, we end up with what we believe is a very competitive marker against where renewable assets trade today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nMichaelLapides: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Actually I have a couple. First of all, just broad big picture renewables. Do you think you're taking share? Meaning, do you think your market share of renewable capacity in the US is actually growing from here? Are you mostly benefiting from the dramatic tailwinds that are happening to the overall space? That's question one. Question two is, there are lots of new entrants every day someone, a new entrant gets announced and well funded, whether it's by pension funds, whether it's European big oil, whether it's by some of the large, super well capitalized and well known alternative asset managers. We saw an announcement out of one of them yesterday of the day before about funding a solar and storage startup. What's that doing the returns? Are you seeing that kind of flow in the cash flow returns yet of new projects you're developing today versus what you may have done a year or 18 months ago?\nRebeccaKujawa: So Mike, I'll start with the middle of it and maybe expand to the right and the left, the middle of it is this market is absolutely growing significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow significantly for years to come. So from our perspective, the pie absolutely is getting bigger. Over a long period of time, our market share has remained very strong in the 20-ish percent range for wind and probably in the mid-teens, occasionally a little bit higher and occasional, probably in the mid teens on solar and storage has actually been higher than both of those, as this market has grown significantly over the last couple of years. When we look out, we focus on both maintaining market share and also maintaining attractive returns. And we think our competitive advantages have enabled us to do that over time and we think both is important and best among them is very important to John and his team are focused on getting the best of the projects that we see out in the marketplace. And ultimately being very happy with the projects that we put into the portfolio.  We get asked the question about new entrants a lot. You know this industry well, if you look back and you stack power purchase agreement awards over many years, you'll see that very big bar to the left when we put the chart together, and a couple of bars that are in smaller, of course, but still decent size and then a whole bunch of small players. They get 100, a couple 100 megawatts a given year. And that dynamic continues to be consistent. That's for Greenfield and kind of in the more development oriented projects, there has been more capital coming in. But that's mostly post COD. And when we think about capturing the value of developing renewables, it really is on that twinkle in the eye of a developer to COD is the enormous opportunity to create value, and we continue to be very good at it, and enhances competitive advantages to maintain that position over time. So we're really excited about what we've been able to accomplish really excited about our position, and really excited about the energy transformation overall and the opportunities that presents.\nMichaelLapides: Got it and then one quick follow up just on NEP, you still have the IDR structure at NEP, and as NEP grows, at what point do you think that becomes, and you've made a revision to it, but it's been a while, but at what point do you reevaluate the necessity of the IDR at the NEE level, and especially given the fact that kind of IDR structures have significantly gone away from some of the other industries that used to use them?\nRebeccaKujawa: Michael, we, obviously we've gotten that question before and in the past, and of course, from NEE's perspective, we continue to be happy with the relationship as it exists today between NEE and NEP. And there's a lot of synergy between the two companies and value created from each of their perspectives from the structure that's in place. And that alignment of incentives remains important we believe to ensuring value creation from both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners perspective. We are excited about the opportunities for both businesses. And we'll see what the future brings but it continues to work and we're very pleased with the alignment of interest today.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today's question-and-answer session and conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica. And good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased more than 9% year-over-year reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.04 year-over-year driven by continued investments in the business. FPL's major capital initiatives remain on track and FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. In June, FPL demolished its last coal fired plant in Florida with plans to replace it with more clean emissions free solar energy facilities. During the quarter, FPL also successfully commissioned approximately 373 megawatts of new solar, including the FPL Discovery Solar Energy Center at Kennedy Space Center. With these new additions FPL surpassed 40% completion of its groundbreaking 30 by 30 plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030. FPL expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022, which would put the company more than 50% on the way towards completing a 30 by 30 plan. And just over three years since the initial announcement. To support its solar build out, FPL recently began installing the first components of the world's largest integrated solar powered battery system. The 409 megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center which expected to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also continued to execute on its growth initiatives during the quarter with its strong financial performance driven primarily by continued investment in the business and further improvements in operational cost effectiveness. Excluding the COVID-19 related expenses which were subsequent reversed and booked into a regulatory asset in the third quarter of 2020, Gulf Power's year-to-date O&M costs declined by approximately 9% versus the prior year comparable period, and have now declined by approximately 31% relative to 2018. Gulf Power's operational performance metrics also continue to improve with reliability of the generation fleet that we operate, and service reliability improving by 71% and 63% respectively, year-to-date versus the first half of 2018. We continue to expect the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we've previously outlined will generate significant customer and shareholder value in the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 7% year-over-year. The energy resources team continues to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low cost renewables and storage, adding approximately 1840 megawatts to its backlog since the last earnings call. This continued origination success is a testament to Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages, including our large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power and supply chain execution, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages, and world class operations capability. Moreover, Energy Resources Advanced Data analytics and machine learning capabilities allow us to utilize the nearly 40 billion operating data points our fleet provides every single day for predictive modeling, further extending our best-in-class O&M and development capabilities. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. We are pleased with the progress we've made at NextEra Energy so far in 2021. And headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $819 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $70 million and $0.04 per share, respectively year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.7% over the same quarter last year, and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 9%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2021. During the quarter, we utilized $100 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $473 million. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $240 million in hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs, in 2019, FPL utilized its available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory assets related to Dorian cost recovery. Earlier in the year FPL and Office of Public council entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of FPL's hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in May.  We were pleased by the Commission's determination that all of FPL hurricane Dorian restoration costs were prudently incurred, and we believe the settlement agreement fairly and reasonably balances the interests of FPL and its customers. Earlier this month, FPL responded to tropical storm Elsa, with a restoration workforce of approximately 7,000 FPL employees and contractors. FPL safely and quickly restored power to nearly 100,000 customers who were impacted by Elsa as the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient energy grid continued to benefit customers. Elsa was the earliest that a fifth named storm has formed in the Atlantic basin. And we remain prepared in advance of what is forecasted to be another active hurricane season in 2021. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2021 net income of $63 million or $0.03 per share. During the quarter Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expected full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of the major capital with the Gulf Power capital projects, including the North Florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid 2022 continue to progress well and Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 17% year-over-year as a result of these smart capital investments for the benefit of customers. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 2021. For the full year 2021, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. Earlier this month, Florida Public Service Commission also approved a settlement agreement between Gulf Power and the Office of Public Council for cost recovery of the approximately $13 million in COVID-19 related expenses, primarily reflected in incremental bad debt and safety expenses as a result of the pandemic. We are pleased with this outcome and believe it demonstrates the continued constructive regulatory environment in the state of Florida, as we work to improve Gulf Power's customer value proposition of low costs, high reliability, excellent customer service and clean energy for our customers. As we anticipated, Florida's economic activity has rebounded since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, as reflected by a wide range of positive economic indicators. Florida's current unemployment rate is 5%, which remains well below the national average. Rolling three month average of new building permits are up approximately 46% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate in nearly eight years, and are the second highest new building permits in the nation. As another indicator of health in Florida's economy, Florida's retail sales index was up over 40% versus the prior year. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices is up over 14% on an annual basis. Recent population growth estimates indicate that Florida remains one of the top destinations for relocating Americans, with Florida adding nearly 330,000 new residents between April of 2020 and April of 2021. We expect this trend to continue, with Florida's population projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1% through 2023 and FPL, including Gulf Power forecasts adding almost 500,000 new customer accounts from 2018 through 2025. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 70,400 from the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 2.1% from the prior year comparable period. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in weather related usage per customer of approximately 2.8%. On weather normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 2.9% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power the average number of customers grew roughly 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter, and Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales decreased 1% year-over-year, as strong customer growth was more than offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2020. As we previously stated on March 12, we initiated Florida Power and Light 2021 base rate proceeding. The four year base rate plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in clean energy generation, long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and keeps customer bills low. Today FPL typical residential bills remain well below the national average and the lowest among the top 20 investor owned utilities in the nation. With a proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average, and typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the four year rate plan. As always we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through our fair settlement agreement. And our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $315 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $574 million or $0.29 per share. Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period. The effect of mark-to-market on non-qualifying hedges which is excluded from adjusted earnings was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.04 per share versus the prior year and primarily reflect growth in our contract of renewables and battery storage program. Adjusted earnings per share contributions from existing generation and storage assets increased $0.01 year-over-year, which includes the impact of unfavorable wind resource during second quarter. NextEra Transmissions adjusted earnings per share contribution also increased $0.01 year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.3 lower year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. All other impacts decreased results by $0.01 per share versus 2020. The Energy Resources Development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the second quarter, with a team adding approximately 1,840 megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we've added approximately 285 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 megawatts of solar and 105 megawatts of battery storage to our backlog assign contracts. With nearly 3.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have already signed more than 75% of the megawatts needed to realize the low end of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. Since the last call, we have also executed a 310 megawatt build own transfer agreement which is not included in our backlog additions. Our customer intends to use this solar-plus-storage project to replace existing coal generation. And we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation into clean, reliable and low cost renewables and storage. Our engineering and construction team continues to perform exceptionally well commissioning approximately 330 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the backlog of wind, solar and storage projects that we expect to build in 2021 and 2022 on track. We are well positioned to complete our more than $20 billion capital investment program at Energy Resources for 2021 and 2022. Last month, the IRS extended safe harbor eligibility on production tax credits and investment tax credits. Providing projects that began construction between 2016 and 2019 with six years to complete construction and projects that started construction in 2020 with five years to achieve their in service dates and qualify for federal tax credits. We believe the extension reflects the strong support of the Biden administration for new renewables and may enable an incremental 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of new wind and wind repowering opportunities. We now have more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy; for the second quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $256 million or $0.13 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.4 billion and $0.71 cents per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. Over the past few months NextEra Energy issued nearly $3.3 billion in new financings under its innovative new NextEra Green bond structure. Funds raised with NextEra Energy green bonds are designated for specific renewable energy and storage projects under development across our businesses. And if funds are not used to bring the renewable projects online within two years, there was a step up in the interest rate on the debt. Our inaugural NextEra Green issuance was 4.5x oversubscribed, priced at a premium to the market and was well received by investors.  We believe that NextEra Green will set a new standard for green issuances moving forward. NextEra Energy has raised more than $9 billion in new capital year-to-date on very favorable terms as we continue to execute on our financing plan for the year. Finally, in June, S&P affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its Funds From Operation or FFO to debt metric, from the previous level of 21% to the new level of 20%. We believe this favorable adjustment reflects the strength of our business, as well as recognition of NextEra Energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors on environmental, social and governance or ESG factors. We believe this is the first time that S&P has formally recognized the benefits to business risk profile related to ESG factors by allowing more constructive financial metrics since it began its practice of identifying the specific ESG key metrics that drive a company's overall credit position. Notably, S&P also revised NextEra Energy's management and governance assessment, from satisfactory to strong to reflect its views on our comprehensive enterprise wide risk management standards, and successful track record of consistently implementing our strategic planning efforts.  Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021 NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022, and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022, and 2023, while at the same time maintaining strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year to at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to an NextEra Energy Partners, NextEra Energy Partners portfolio performed well and deliver financial results are generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below average renewable resource. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 11%, respectively, versus 2020. This strong operational and financial performance highlights the NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution $0.6625 per common unit or $2.65 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 250% since the IPO.  Further building on that strength, today we are announcing the NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from NextEra Energy Resources. I'll provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes. NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financing during second quarter to secure funding for its recently announced 2021 acquisitions and further enhance its financing flexibility. In June, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes and concurrently entered into a capped call structure that is expected to result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining the upside from up to 50% appreciation in its unit price over the three years associated with a convertible notes. NextEra Energy Partners also drew the remaining funds from its 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which was upsized by approximately $150 million during the quarter evidencing continued investor demand for exposure to the high quality long term contract of renewables projects and the underlying portfolio of assets that was established last year. Finally, NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed the sale of approximately 700,000 NEP common units year-to-date through its recently expired at the market or ATM program, raising roughly $50 million in proceeds. Going forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations. And in the near term NextEra Energy Partners intends to renew the program for up to $300 million in issuances over the next three years to permit additional financing flexibility. As a result of these financings, and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 599 megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources, as well as previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year. Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA $350 million was roughly flat versus the prior year comparable quarter driven by favorable contributions from the approximately 500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects acquired in 2020. Weaker wind and solar resource in this second quarter, which reduced this quarters adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects by roughly $22 million was partially offset by positive contributions to adjusted EBITDA from last year's repowering and the Texas pipelines. Wind resource for the quarter was 93% of the long-term average versus 100% in the second quarter of 2020. Cash available for distribution of $151 million for the second quarter was also reduced for existing projects due to the distributions for the convertible equity portfolio financing entered into late last year. As a reminder, this convertible equity portfolio financing recapitalize NextEra Energy Partners' existing Genesis solar project and other assets, and the proceeds were used to fund last year's acquisition from Energy Resources. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. We remain on track for the strong full year growth consistent with our long-term growth objectives of 12% to 15% distributions per unit growth through at least 2024. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. The portfolio consists of approximately 830 megawatts of renewables, of which NextEra Energy Partners will be acquiring an approximately 590 megawatt net interest. NextEra Energy Partners' interest in the portfolio will consist of approximately 510 megawatts of universal scale wind and solar projects, and approximately 80 megawatts of distributed solar projects, which is NextEra Energy Partners' first acquisition of distributed generation assets. The portfolio to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners has a cash available for distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 17 years and a counterparty credit rating of Baa1 at Moody's and BBB at S&P. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Energy Resources currently owns the country's largest portfolio of distributed generation assets with commercial and industrial customers, and expects to triple its capital investment and distributed generation from 2020 through 2020. NextEra Energy Partners expects to benefit from this expansion over the coming years through future acquisitions from Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a total consideration of $563 million subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEra Energy Partners' share of the portfolio's debt and tax equity financings is estimated to be approximately $270 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million to $100 million, and cash available for distribution of approximately $41 million to $49 million, each on five year average annual run rate basis beginning on December 31 2021. The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded with existing liquidity, and the transaction is expected to close prior to year end and be immediately accretive to LP distributions.  NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and capped the expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats, and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022, to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At NextEra Energy we were honored to be named on Time magazine's first ever list of Top 100 most influential companies, which highlights businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transformation in our sector and remained focused on executing upon the opportunities presented by the significant growth in wind, solar and various forms of energy storage in the US over the coming decades. At FPL, including Gulf Power, that means continuing to deliver on our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions. At Energy Resources, our competitive advantages, position as well to capture a meaningful share of the significant and expanding market for renewables. And at NextEra Energy Partners with its continued access to low cost capital, and accretive acquisition opportunities, is well positioned as ever to take advantage of the clean energy transformation, reshaping the energy industry. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Yes, thanks, Shar. Appreciate the question. From our perspective, and we're looking out decades and looking at the enormous renewables build opportunity across the US. It is clear that over time new transmission needs to be built to support some of that build out. And it's not necessarily imperative today for that transmission to be built. But it certainly is important to start today to build the type of infrastructure that's needed over time. So we're really excited about the opportunities that the NextEra Energy Transmission team has. And I would expect over time that we will grow both organically and continue to look for acquisition opportunities, like we have over the last couple of years to supplement and build out that portfolio. We're thrilled with the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that we closed a couple of years ago, very excited to bring the GridLiance team on board and will continue to focus on opportunities, both organically and through acquisition over time.  From a broader policy standpoint, we saw that important for FERC the regional ISOs to continue to focus on how you support that transmission build out. And we certainly are happy to see that to start to be a focus at FERC this year in particular, and contemplating how do they support it going forward. And I think there's a receptive audience in the Biden administration, making sure that they support laying a foundation that supportive of renewables, not just in the next couple of years, but in the next couple of decades. So transmission moves slowly, you know that. So stay tuned. But we're optimistic both about our direct prospects in the near term as well as longer term. Our Energy Resources Development team clearly as evidenced by not only the signings this quarter, but looking back at quarters now going back quite a number of them have just had terrific origination success. And I've encouraged everybody to not just focus on an individual quarter and look at a slightly broader trend. And we're really pleased not only with what we've seen looking back and what the team has been able to execute on, but also looking forward. And that's what gave us the confidence just early this year, to not only increase but expand the horizon for our development expectations, such that our four year period starting '21 through '24 is 23 to 30 gigawatts, which is just an exceptional number and one that we're really excited and proud of the team for taking on and we're thrilled to be at 75% already at the low end today. In terms of our customer demand remains very strong across the board, and we're certainly excited about bringing that into more signed contracts going forward. In terms of costs, as you know, we'll continue to incorporate our latest expectations and industry's latest expectations for costs. And we feel very comfortable with the returns that we see and excited about the opportunities going forward. Shar, as we've talked about with you all, from an investor standpoint, we're very focused over years now leading up to the case as a matter of our strategy making sure that the best customer value proposition possible, and you can see that in our execution on O&M, or reliability on customer service. And, of course, the continued focused on clean energy generation, because that's in our control. What's also in our control is putting forward the best case possible to ensure that we're articulating that strategy, not only what the team has accomplished, but what we plan to do in the coming four years to support continued execution. So the team is very focused on continuing to go through the process. And culminating with the hearings, in short order and commission decision later this year if we go that far. But we're also always very interested in having a win-win solution with stakeholders. We certainly appreciate the history of that in Florida, not just with us, but with other utilities and broader stakeholder base. And we will continue to remain very engaged and any sort of constructive outcome that we could bring forward with stakeholders, we think that's positive for our customers and broader stakeholders, if we can accomplish it, but we're focused on the task at hand and we'll continue through the process and see where we are at the end of the year. Yes, thanks, Julien. And I'll start with some kind of near term thoughts. And then think about the broader term second, near term, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we feel very comfortable with where we are with our backlog and what we plan to build in the 2021 and 2022 timeframe. And our comments reflected that in the prepared remarks. And it's a real credit to the way that we approach this business, and our engineering, construction and integrated supply chain teams are really working through a variety of different circumstances over the last year and a half. And we've secured the equipment that we need to build out those projects and of course have some contractual agreements in place that help us feel comfortable about acquisition. From a longer term standpoint, I think it still remains to be seen in some respects. So you can see that in broad set of discussion across the financial and the broader US economy, dialogue of whether or not this is temporary related to near term snapbacks in demand and hurdles in the supply chain that may not persist over time, or if it is systemic and persisting. So I think that remains a little bit to be seen. One thing that's very fortunate for renewables, as you all well know, is that renewable energy projects are very much the least cost form of generation in many parts, if not most of parts of the US. So even if there is a change in pricing, if these cost increases are persistent and systemic over a long period of time, the value proposition is still very clear for renewables relative to alternatives. And then beyond that, we also need to think about what implications if any there will be from policy changes. So I think that the net takeaway is somewhat premised in your question is that we feel comfortable with where we are, we're prepared for a variety of set of circumstances. And we're thrilled with a position of renewables and the growth opportunities. And honestly, the decades ahead. Yes, Steve, I wouldn't read into it. To kind of consistent with the overall backlog additions, I think you'd need to look a little bit broader in just a three month period to get an indication of trends. What we see is not a slowdown in storage at all, there's a lot of interest in new storage opportunities, not just with our customers, but even from a regulatory standpoint in certain jurisdictions where storage could be particularly helpful given certain dynamics in various markets. So we're very excited about the storage opportunity and don't see a change in the overall dynamics as of opportunities. Steve, you can appreciate we and of course, the NEP board and Energy Resources perspectives all constantly looking at what valuations are and where third party transactions have transacted and we think about the valuations in those light. And I think with where costs of capital are and demands for renewable projects, I think this transaction appropriately balances and reflects those dynamics. I would characterize it Steve as a work in progress. Obviously, the events that happened in February were pretty significant. And it takes time to work through and properly account for where there were sources of pressure and what the appropriate responses are, from obviously, from a political but of course, most probably from regulatory and a policy standpoint. And I think they're still sorting through it. Obviously, Governor Abbott has asked for certain actions to be taken for the PUCT and ERCOT. And there's a framework that the PUCT has started to lay out. But I think it's still time to work through what those details look like. From our perspective you know well, we've been very active in a variety of aspects in ERCOT, we know that market well. And we certainly have a strong perspective on what needs to be addressed in particular to focus on what really went wrong in February, including a massive amount of disruption across the gas supply, not only from supply, but transmission and ultimately, consumption by end users. And we hope that a lot of the actions will be focused on that, as opposed to things that that won't necessarily help and solve the fundamental problems at hand. But I think the most important part is work in progress. Well you know all of us, Steven, we love technology; we love innovation. And we certainly are excited about a lot of changes that are happening across the energy sector. I think the biggest driver dynamic in our sector today is really the cost of renewables overall, even today. And that alone is stimulating a significant amount of change. And that adoption over time, will create the need for more storage, like applications, whether it's lithium ion, or I think the technology you are referencing in the Wall Street Journal, of course, hydrogen in the longer term, which we're also very excited about. Those were all very interesting, particularly for the latter part of the 2020s and into 2030 and beyond, which could help support the substantial build up that we're expecting in the short term, I think the biggest dynamic is what we see at hand, which is the economic value proposition of renewables. What we think could change that probably near term than even some of the innovations you're talking about is policy. You all I know are following just like we are in participating in a variety of discussions in Washington. But if the incentives are addressed in legislation, that could be a big driver of change in the industry as well, in terms of timing. I'm not sure I understand the question, Stephen. Are you talking about the proceeds? We haven't disclosed that yet, Stephen, as we go through the process, of course, we will update the financial statements, assuming that the transaction closes. But we are very pleased from an Energy Resources perspective with these projects consistent overall returns with the types of returns that we see across wind and solar and distributed generation projects. On the DG side, we continue to be very excited about the business in Energy Resources; the team has done a terrific job building it. And as I commented in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to triple the investment that we've made in the business, and those tend to be very attractive returns. I don't think, I wouldn't think it was characterized in anything unusual, Steven, we're happy with the overall returns of the project. And I do think that the capped yields are reflective of market transactions that we see in the marketplace and really reflective of substantial demand for renewables. And we've said continue to be very excited about the prospects for NEP. I'm sorry, was the guidance changed? What was the -- I missed that part? I understand now sorry about that. No, from our expectations, if you look at our guidance expectations, even at the end of last year, which is when we started talking about what the expectations for run rates at the end of this year, they were for an increase. This transaction was something that we were anticipating as part of our growth expectations. We do expect to be at the high end of the ranges as we've articulated for both adjusted EBITDA and CAFD for year end. We will continue to be opportunistic. There's a lot of flexibility within the NEP portfolio, we continue to have a pretty low payout ratio. If you recall, about a year and a half ago, we took some actions to disperse the lever but also supplement the portfolio during the uncertainty of the PG&E bankruptcy and continue to have a relatively low payout ratio. One of the advantages of that is NextEra Energy Partners can be opportunistic in terms of meeting its distribution per unit growth targets of 12% to 15%, which is really the metric against for really managing and measuring the business to ensure that we can meet those expectations. We provide the expectations for run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD to give a sense of how we're expecting to achieve them. But there is flexibility and how we get there. There's a lot of flexibility inherent to that safe harbor portfolio, but we see it mostly as an option to create the opportunity to realize the tax incentives. Just as we seen over the last couple of years, there have been extensions in terms of timeframes and even extensions in terms of the available percentage of the tax credit in the given period. So maintaining flexibility and optionality is our first priority. We continue to feel very comfortable with the 2021 and 2022 build being able to meet the equipment needs and ultimately bring them into service and timeframes that are very attractive from an Energy Resources perspective. So Mike, I'll start with the middle of it and maybe expand to the right and the left, the middle of it is this market is absolutely growing significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow significantly for years to come. So from our perspective, the pie absolutely is getting bigger. Over a long period of time, our market share has remained very strong in the 20-ish percent range for wind and probably in the mid-teens, occasionally a little bit higher and occasional, probably in the mid teens on solar and storage has actually been higher than both of those, as this market has grown significantly over the last couple of years. When we look out, we focus on both maintaining market share and also maintaining attractive returns. And we think our competitive advantages have enabled us to do that over time and we think both is important and best among them is very important to John and his team are focused on getting the best of the projects that we see out in the marketplace. And ultimately being very happy with the projects that we put into the portfolio.  We get asked the question about new entrants a lot. You know this industry well, if you look back and you stack power purchase agreement awards over many years, you'll see that very big bar to the left when we put the chart together, and a couple of bars that are in smaller, of course, but still decent size and then a whole bunch of small players. They get 100, a couple 100 megawatts a given year. And that dynamic continues to be consistent. That's for Greenfield and kind of in the more development oriented projects, there has been more capital coming in. But that's mostly post COD. And when we think about capturing the value of developing renewables, it really is on that twinkle in the eye of a developer to COD is the enormous opportunity to create value, and we continue to be very good at it, and enhances competitive advantages to maintain that position over time. So we're really excited about what we've been able to accomplish really excited about our position, and really excited about the energy transformation overall and the opportunities that presents. Michael, we, obviously we've gotten that question before and in the past, and of course, from NEE's perspective, we continue to be happy with the relationship as it exists today between NEE and NEP. And there's a lot of synergy between the two companies and value created from each of their perspectives from the structure that's in place. And that alignment of incentives remains important we believe to ensuring value creation from both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners perspective. We are excited about the opportunities for both businesses. And we'll see what the future brings but it continues to work and we're very pleased with the alignment of interest today."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.\nJessica Aldridge: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are Jim Robo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners as well as Eric Silagy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Rebecca will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation when we refer to FPP, we're referring to Florida Power & Light excluding Gulf Power unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you, Jessica and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent in the core focused areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior year comparable period which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter FPL successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost effective solar projects built under its SolarTogether program which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. FPL now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system which is more than any other utility in the country. FPL's other major capital investments including the 409 megawatts Manatee Energy Storage Center and highly efficient 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center are also on schedule and on budget. By executing on smart capital investments such as these FPL is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, highly reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL's typical residential bills remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest US investor-owned utilities while our service reliability has never been higher. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on the operational cost effectiveness at Gulf Power continues to progress well with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year primarily driven by year-to-date OEM cost declining by approximately 21% versus the prior year comparable period and by more than 34% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety with no OSHA recordable year-to-date through the end of March. We remain committed to delivering on the objective that we've previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. We continue to see increased stakeholder focused on environmental social and governance or ESG factors helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new non-traditional customers particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for Energy Resources in the coming years. We have been encouraged by the Biden Administrations focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. We continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage including hydrogen as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. We support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well. We believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over two decades. As a push for actions to address climate change and acceleration of progress towards decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than NextEra Energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Now let's turn to the detailed results beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2021. During the quarter we utilized $316 million of reserved amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $578 million. As we previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserved amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses and we expect to continue this trend this year. Let me now turn to Gulf Power which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers and we expect its full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of Gulf Power's major capital investments including the North Florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022 continue to progress well. As a result of these ongoing investments regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending March 2021. Turning to our development and planning efforts. We recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. The 10-year site plan projects that zero emission sources will provide nearly 40% of all energy produced across the combined FPL system in 2030. Largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and success in its coal phase out strategy. FPL expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost effective solar over the next four year and we now control all of the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined FPL system. The site plan also reflects and expect a total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. This plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar paired with battery storage in Florida is an increasingly cost effective form of generation in most parts of the US. As we execute on these opportunities, we project that FPL's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005 and 20% lower than the US Department of Energy's projected industry average in 2030. Moreover we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. During the quarter FPL placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 location across the combined FPL service area from 2019 through 2020. As we previously discussed, we're also developing hydrogen electrolysis project at FPL's Okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into FPL's generation system. There approximately 25 megawatts solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the Okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the US to-date. While these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at FPL. We are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves towards cleaner and more sustainable future. The Florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. Their current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits Case - Shiller index for South Florida up approximately 6% and 10% respectively versus the prior year. Florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolster our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth. During the quarter FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. We estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather related usage for customer. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued economic growth in Northwest Florida. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased to 2.9% year-over-year primarily due to favorable weather. On March 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for Florida Power & Light 2021 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with a test year. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January 2022, $607 million starting in January 2023 and solar base rate adjustments or SoBRA mechanisms in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost effective solar. We are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country with typical residential bills of approximately 13% low state average and importantly nearly 10% lower than in 2006. The four-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advance technology which continues to improve our already best in class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other cost. We believe that FPL's typical residential bills will grow in an average annual rate of about 3.4% from January 2021 through the end of 2025 which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills, 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decreased approximately 1% over the four-year rate plan. The Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for the proceeding beginning with Quality of Service hearing in June and technical hearings in late August. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with a staff of recommendations and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we're open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. Energy Resources reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share up 13% versus the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.04 per share primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted win projects that were commissioned during 2020. The extreme market conditions in Texas in February were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business as well as the favourable performance in the gas infrastructure business. As a reminder when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in Texas as a portfolio and while there were pluses and minuses during these events. We believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well diversified business. All weather impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog including a 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts of four-hour battery storage capacity. In 2020, our market share of signed contracts and collocated solar plus storage assets in US was more than 35% and we're excited about the continued trend and demand for collocated storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector. We also added 916 megawatts of new win projects to our backlog for 2022. In addition, our backlog increased by energy resources share of NextEra Energy Partners planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. With the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter our backlog of signed contracts at Energy Resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts supporting our industry leading long-term growth expectations. We remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the US economy presents for Energy Resources and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications. In addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls. We've recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. This investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to-date show the promise of electrification across our economy and we're excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth and demand for electricity. Consistent with our long-term track record we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission further its efforts to build America's leading transmission company with a closing of its acquisition of GridLiance occurring at the end of last month. GridLiance which owns three FERC regulated transmission utilities spanning six states is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate regulated assets. NextEra Energy Transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and six regional transmission organizations. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the US to support this transmission to a low cost, low carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. Our incorporation of GridLiance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider both to deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other segments were roughly flat year-over-year. Long-term financial expectations which we increased and extended to late last year through 2023 remained unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share and we will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners which delivered very strong first quarter results with year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36% respectively. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6375 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis up approximately 15% from a year earlier inclusive of this increased NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the IPO. Further building on that strength, NextEra Energy Partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. This transaction will be NextEra Energy Partners first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. I'll provide additional detail on the transaction in just a few minutes. Turning to the detailed quarterly results. NextEra Energy Partners first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $354 million and cash available for distribution was $184 million. New projects which primarily reflect the assets acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 contributed $27 million of adjusted EBITDA and $13 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. This strong year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from NextEra Energy Partners wind and natural gas pipeline investments in Texas during the February winter storm partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our Genesis project during the quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. The portfolio has a cash available distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers and further enhances the diversity of NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive CAFY yield and be immediately accretive to LP distributions. This transaction demonstrates the NextEra Energy Partners continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and it's enhanced by our ability to take advantage of Energy Resources best in class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the assets. Energy Resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower cost across its renewable assets that it operates. Since 2017 Energy Resources have reduced fleet-wide dollar per megawatt hour O&M cost in its wind fleet by more than 30% and we believe those Energy Resources wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. With Energy Resources operate in the NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets these cost advantages directly benefit LP unit holders. Over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of energy resources operating portfolio platform for both NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions. In addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. We continue to believe that the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years and expect the portfolio we're acquiring provides additional long-term investments opportunities as well. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million subject to closing adjustments. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning in December 31, 2021. We believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing which we use to fund the acquisition along with the existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. Following the recently announced transaction we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cast the expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $680 million respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and includes the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. Energy Resources main significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to deliver on its already best in class run rate for LP distribution growth. Finally, last month we were honored the NextEra was ranked Number 1 in its sector for Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Company's list for the 14th time in 15 years. Moreover, we're recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values while helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish NextEra Energy's 2021 ESG Report which we believe establishes our full alignment with the taskforce for climate related financial disclosures or TCFD recommendations. We're also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project survey later this year. These enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with a key tenant of ESG which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, I will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] today's first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Just couple of questions here. First just on transmission opportunities, obviously you closed GridLiance this quarter and there's been some proposals across the US including California for transmission expansions. Can we maybe get a little bit of refreshed view on your transmission growth strategy and kind of geographies where you may seek to expand? Do you guys see more opportunities for acquisitions perhaps from other PT [ph] type owners? And just as a follow-up here, any thoughts on sort of the new FERC administration recent language could hinder I think future transmission investment with potentially lower ROE removals some of the ROE adders, so just some thoughts there.\nRebecca Kujawa: Perfect, thanks Shar. I was going to say yes, the question. But I think its multiple questions in here. So I'll start and obviously John or Jim can jump in, if they want to add something. We are very excited about opportunities in transmission and it is founded on a couple of points that I highlighted in the script. First, is we couldn't be more excited as you well know about the renewables opportunities across the US in the coming decades. A key part of all of those opportunities or at least a lot of those opportunities in later part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond, is some level of build out of transmission in the US beyond what's been accomplished. So both to enable to long-term renewables development but also to capitalize on those opportunities leaves us very interested in transmission. The Energy Resources team has done a terrific job growing that business both through organic opportunities so long-term development efforts identifying opportunities, participating in processes and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and build successfully into line and into operation some of those lines as well as through acquisitions. Obviously with GridLiance being the most recent and Trans Bay Cable not being too much far behind it. I expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market. On the FERC transmission side, we do think there are lot of opportunities to improve how transmission is sided and built across the US and we're optimistic that this administration and this FERC will start to focus on those and I think to go through FERC as well as potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. So a lot of opportunities to invest in the future.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, the only thing that I would add to what Rebecca said there is, we love GridLiance. Think of our transmission presence of doughnut. We had a hole in the middle. This gets us in the SPP and MISO. We're now a member as a TO - important for [indiscernible] as well. It's strategic. It's going to help enable lot of new renewable development for us. So it lines up really well with where we see renewable growth opportunities going forward. And even with the news coming out of FERC on the ROE, we'll see what they'll ultimately do. Don't forget that we've been able to enter in the long-term settlements at Trans Bay and on Lone Star as well and so our business is really unimpacted.\nShar Pourreza: Got it perfect, thank you. And then just on the rate case and obviously it's starting to pick up steam, intervene is turning together. Are you seeing any early indications for what sort of topics that maybe debated? I mean affordability is the obvious one, cross - subsidization between the two merged utilities that could be another ROE. So just maybe just thinking about the bit ask there. At this juncture, do you sort of feel there is a settlement path or does this case kind of need to be more litigated just given the complexities of merging two utilities.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks Shar. I think it's really early to comment on the rate case. We just filed. I think you've heard us comment a couple of times, these as U-Haul trucks versus filing requirements that we produce and supply to staff and the interveners and the commission itself to start the process. So we're very early and no doubt all of the key stakeholders just trying to review that information and then we'll see the process unfold really over quite a number of months accommodating with the hearings in August. We are very proud as I highlight in the comments both here and in other venues. We're really proud of the case that the FPL team has put together not just the case itself. But it's built on a foundation of execution not just over the last five years during which we've operated under the settlement agreements but of course years and years before that. So we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process. As it relates to settlements, as you know here in Florida there is a great history of settlement agreements not just with Florida Power & Light Company but other utilities in the state. We do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcomes that meets the need of all stakeholders and historically that is produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. There's a great history of that. We of course will be open to it. But it's very early in this process and again we look forward to being able to put forward our case.\nShar Pourreza: And just lastly on Santee Cooper, I mean obviously the discussion they're picking up steam at the legislator. And do you think we should we kind of watching for in the near term on the legislature side and your bids out there? So do you see any kind of changes with your offer or you're just kind of standing firm at this point?\nJim Robo: Sure, it's Jim. Obviously, you saw the senate asked for folks to re-express an interest. I sent a letter last week re-expressing our interest. We've been pretty clear that we remain interested. We have a very strong bid out there. Obviously, things are changed in the last year with Santee Cooper rate base is different. Their volumes are different etc, etc. But fundamentally our bid stands and we're ready to get going and negotiating with the state on the sale and ultimately the most important thing is, it remains very clear to me that the best route to the state and its customer and the economy of the state is to demunicipalize [ph] Santee Cooper and get it in the hands of an entity like ourselves that will run it in best in class way and there's enormous value I think to bring to the state through our ability to bring to decarbonize, our ability to have low bills over the long period of time and our ability to really operate efficiently and bring great reliability to bear. I think you've seen the progress we've made at Gulf and I think that's a great example of the kind of progress that we'd be able to make at Santee Cooper as well.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific, thank you guys for everything and good execution.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Just curios first on the NEP acquisition, as you mentioned for the most part historically you haven't been able to make the turns lower fund third-party acquisitions. So could you maybe talk about the returns you expect on this transaction and is this a suggestion that you're more optimistic that there'll be more third-party acquisitions that meet your return hurdles.\nRebecca Kujawa: We're really excited about the acquisition and we've highlighted both in terms of the financial characteristics of it. One of the things that was particularly attractive about this portfolio when we looked at it is, our teams' ability to add value on the operation and maintenance cost side. Really think about as we bring assets into the portfolio, it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate and so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the Energy Resources management of these assets at NextEra Energy Partners. We've been very excited about NextEra Energy Partners growth outlook for quite some time as we've always indicated our excitement is well founded, just simply looking at the backlog of those operating and signed contracts and then the potential for new contract synergy resources. But have always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set and we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities. I do think there are more opportunities out there, third-party acquisitions on the renewables side. It's an area of focus for us to continue to participate in. but we've got the three ways to grow and to the extent that we can put opportunities to be rather great and we'll take advantage of them overtime. But we also continue to have terrific organic opportunities in NEP particularly as the portfolio grows and then of course the continued success of Energy Resources in the broader market is very positive.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay and just any sense on the returns you expect on this acquisition?\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. We've already highlighted in terms of cap fee produced for the assets $60 million plus relative to the acquisition price that we highlighted obviously that's subject to closing adjustments. So that's at the project level and then we'll optimize the financing overtime particularly as we think about the rest of the growth expectations for 2021 into 2022.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay and then just maybe a little bit more color on the Biden infrastructure and tax plan just I guess maybe obviously you made it clear that the infrastructure side will be beneficial for your business. How are you thinking on the tax side and are there any risk to you from that either just the high rate or the minimum book tax issue? Thanks.\nJim Robo: Steve, its Jim. Obviously, there was a lot unpacked in the plan. It's very early in the process. I think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. There's obviously a lot in the plan that's very positive from a renewable standpoint and as Rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we're excited to work with the administration on the plan that I think is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the US economy over the next several years in a way that we've always said for a long time is going to be essentially free to customers i.e. not more expensive for customers. I mean the thing about the green economy is that it's cleaner, it's greener but it's also cheaper and that's why it's so powerful. So lot of details obviously still to be worked out. We're working them as you can imagine it's very early and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot. On the tax front, I think obviously that's - there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewables assets and we're working through it. Think about the tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwinds. I'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. So we continue to work obviously that as well. Lots of details still be laid out on the minimum tax issue and that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being. And I guess the last thing I would say is, none of this is going to be easy to get done. It's very narrow margins in both the Senate in the House and folks tend to focus on the Senate. Its extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the house right now as well and there's - the history on mid-term elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in mid-term for whatever party is in power in mid-term elections on a presidency. So that on the one hand I think put some urgency I think around the administrations push to get something this year. But the flipside is, it also - there's a lot of risk for moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues. It's going to be very - any change will be very hard. I think we were very much a part of the - we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in Washington and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working it very hard. But I will just say in closing, that we're very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonising the economy. We feel like it's the - absolutely the right thing for the planet and the right thing for customers and the right thing for the country and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization and I think, any acceleration of what's already going on just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen and you saw there was a PTC, hydrogen PTC as part of the suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. So there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Wanted to explore green hydrogen a little bit further. You all have expressed a lot of enthusiasm about the potential for growth here and the potential for joint venture activity and I was just curious, your latest thinking there and I guess broadly I've been thinking that sort of combing best in class renewables that you have with significant capabilities and actually sort of marketing, distributing, selling etc hydrogen would be critical to success in terms of supply of unused customers with green hydrogen. I'm just curious your general outlook enthusiasm for the prospect for more JV announcements.\nRebecca Kujawa: Perfect. Thanks Stephen. Let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter term which would really tie into I think the latter part of your question in comment. The first part which is the latter term view is when we look at substantial deployment of renewable and battery storage and think about how do you further decarbonize the US electricity sector. When we previously ran that analysis just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage. It became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more and more renewables and storage you add, absent other actions. So when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought which is effectively a form of long duration storage that is taking advantage of chief electricity production coming from renewables in some cases excess renewable production at certain times of the day. That substantially changes the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. So that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long duration storage that continues to be very value accretive to customers both in cost and in the performance of clean energy. So that's kind of the starting point, but then coming back to a little bit more nearer term. If you think about how do you decarbonize transportation industrial sectors. The most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells or through hydrogen and hydrogen probably more applicable on the industrial sector particularly for applications that already exist today. And as Jim highlighted the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by Congress is part of the infrastructure package. In the near term we could see a closing of the GAAP perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel based. So yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables for electricity sector, industrial and transportation. But also as you suggested potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself whether it's the electrolyzer or rather forms of creating and distributing the molecules. How much and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots. That both John and the Energy Resources team as well as Eric within Florida Power & Light are thinking through today. How do we do that economically? How do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities? You'll see us continue to place small bets to get experienced to build relationships to gain knowledge and in the short-term that won't add up to heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity. But it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well.\nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful and then just separately thinking about the mix of growth that resources. Obviously, there's a lot of solar activity, lot of solar megawatts that you'll be deploying. I just wanted to get your latest thinking on the outlook for returns between solar and wind. I guess I generally hear continued views that yes, solar returns certainly lower than wind. There is more competition there. But just curious your latest thoughts on solar versus wind return outlook.\nRebecca Kujawa: From a return standpoint, we do see a differential we have quite for time overall returns between wind and solar from a risk adjusted basis. We're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. In the short-term in terms of backlog John and the Energy Resources team certainly influenced by what I think is the conventional wisdom for a long time, the step downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step down for the investment tax credit on solar or in fact likely to happen. I think our customers now are thinking about that a little differently as discussions in Washington have started to heat up. But as we look what our likely outcomes as Jim was talking through including the potential for extensions of those incentives. I think the key takeaway is, they remain both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. So they remain attractive from our perspective and we continue to focus our development and efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers.\nStephen Byrd: Very good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Weinstein: On the subject of third - party acquisition for NEP. Could you comment on any opportunities you're seeing in Texas following Winter Storm Uri? I think we've heard some previous comments there are lots of parties looking at distressed assists in the state and wondering that if there might be an opportunity for NEP as well.\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes Michael, I think it's probably still a little bit too soon. I think most participants in the market are still working through a lot of the implications and learning's from Texas. So I'm not sure there's a lot to be commented on in the near term. It's obviously something we'll stay engaged in the market and participate where it makes sense. But at this point, I think it's too soon.\nMichael Weinstein: Can you comment a little bit about how much it costs to weatherize in the state? What actions you guys have been taking since the storm?\nRebecca Kujawa: So we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. As I've talked about in the past and you all know, we have a lot of interest across Texas not only wind investment, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments and of course the small retail business. So we've been carefully thinking through all of - whether the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward. Specifically to weatherizing, I don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewable fleet or you're talking about the gas infrastructure side. But on the renewable side keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects and ambient temperature at least for our fleet. I can't speak for everybody was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a P-50 forecast. It was really related to the fact in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days it was preceded by an icing event. So ice was accumulating on our blades and when ice accumulates on the blades it's difficult for them to spin and because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there wasn't an opportunity for that ice to shed. Typically weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. This is something the industry is focused on. There are some - what at this point are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades and given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year and ends up being very cost prohibitive for something that happened very sporadically. So I'm not optimistic that there's a substantial amount due to at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the events. I do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow which obviously was really at the crux of the issues along with not only natural gas, supply shortages but plant issues in the coal fleet and issues in nuclear fleet. So there's opportunities across the market to invest.\nJohn Ketchum: And if I could just add to that, what Rebecca said, this is John. When you look at ERCOT's operating fleet what they really do have to address at the end of the way as weatherization of gas because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available. I mean renewables on an MCF adjusted basis for only about 3 gigawatts of that and very much a rounding error and the problem that occurred in Texas and so Texas really needs to think through what are the right solutions for gas because when you have icing conditions. It doesn't matter if it's blades on a turbine. It's combustion gas turbine. It's a nuclear power plant. It's a coal plant. When you have severe icing conditions. They're all going to fail and that's what we saw in Texas. And so the question is, what is going to be the right market construct going forward to provide the appropriate for weatherization and for backup fuel on site to make sure that these facilities are capable of running and I think those are the kinds of issues that the Texas legislature is currently evaluating.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. One last question from me. Does third - party acquisitions at NEP put any kind of pressure on IDR payments [ph] and the IDR scheme going forward?\nRebecca Kujawa: I'm not sure what you mean by pressure, they're ultimately the calculation for IDRs is one that's known and relates to the overall growth and cash flow within NEP. So it's not specific to where the acquisition source was for the asset.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay, just wondering if you see a big uptick in third - party acquisition instead of dropdown cash going up to next year? Is there any kind of pressure one way or another to change the IDR structure?\nRebecca Kujawa: No there's not a difference in terms of the structure and at this point in time NextEra Energy Partners and NextEra Energy with the idea of the structure that's currently in place.\nMichael Weinstein: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Yes, the only thing that I would add to what Rebecca said there is, we love GridLiance. Think of our transmission presence of doughnut. We had a hole in the middle. This gets us in the SPP and MISO. We're now a member as a TO - important for [indiscernible] as well. It's strategic. It's going to help enable lot of new renewable development for us. So it lines up really well with where we see renewable growth opportunities going forward. And even with the news coming out of FERC on the ROE, we'll see what they'll ultimately do. Don't forget that we've been able to enter in the long-term settlements at Trans Bay and on Lone Star as well and so our business is really unimpacted. And if I could just add to that, what Rebecca said, this is John. When you look at ERCOT's operating fleet what they really do have to address at the end of the way as weatherization of gas because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available.

            "name": "Jim Robo",
            "content": "Sure, it's Jim. Obviously, you saw the senate asked for folks to re-express an interest. I sent a letter last week re-expressing our interest. We've been pretty clear that we remain interested. We have a very strong bid out there. Obviously, things are changed in the last year with Santee Cooper rate base is different. Their volumes are different etc, etc. But fundamentally our bid stands and we're ready to get going and negotiating with the state on the sale and ultimately the most important thing is, it remains very clear to me that the best route to the state and its customer and the economy of the state is to demunicipalize [ph] Santee Cooper and get it in the hands of an entity like ourselves that will run it in best in class way and there's enormous value I think to bring to the state through our ability to bring to decarbonize, our ability to have low bills over the long period of time and our ability to really operate efficiently and bring great reliability to bear. I think you've seen the progress we've made at Gulf and I think that's a great example of the kind of progress that we'd be able to make at Santee Cooper as well. Steve, its Jim. Obviously, there was a lot unpacked in the plan. It's very early in the process. I think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. There's obviously a lot in the plan that's very positive from a renewable standpoint and as Rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we're excited to work with the administration on the plan that I think is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the US economy over the next several years in a way that we've always said for a long time is going to be essentially free to customers i.e. not more expensive for customers. I mean the thing about the green economy is that it's cleaner, it's greener but it's also cheaper and that's why it's so powerful. So lot of details obviously still to be worked out. We're working them as you can imagine it's very early and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot. On the tax front, I think obviously that's - there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewables assets and we're working through it. Think about the tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwinds. I'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. So we continue to work obviously that as well. Lots of details still be laid out on the minimum tax issue and that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being. And I guess the last thing I would say is, none of this is going to be easy to get done. It's very narrow margins in both the Senate in the House and folks tend to focus on the Senate. Its extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the house right now as well and there's - the history on mid-term elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in mid-term for whatever party is in power in mid-term elections on a presidency. So that on the one hand I think put some urgency I think around the administrations push to get something this year. But the flipside is, it also - there's a lot of risk for moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues. It's going to be very - any change will be very hard. I think we were very much a part of the - we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in Washington and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working it very hard. But I will just say in closing, that we're very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonising the economy. We feel like it's the - absolutely the right thing for the planet and the right thing for customers and the right thing for the country and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization and I think, any acceleration of what's already going on just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen and you saw there was a PTC, hydrogen PTC as part of the suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. So there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent in the core focused areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior year comparable period which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter FPL successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost effective solar projects built under its SolarTogether program which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. FPL now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system which is more than any other utility in the country. FPL's other major capital investments including the 409 megawatts Manatee Energy Storage Center and highly efficient 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center are also on schedule and on budget. By executing on smart capital investments such as these FPL is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, highly reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL's typical residential bills remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest US investor-owned utilities while our service reliability has never been higher. Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on the operational cost effectiveness at Gulf Power continues to progress well with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year primarily driven by year-to-date OEM cost declining by approximately 21% versus the prior year comparable period and by more than 34% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety with no OSHA recordable year-to-date through the end of March. We remain committed to delivering on the objective that we've previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. We continue to see increased stakeholder focused on environmental social and governance or ESG factors helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new non-traditional customers particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for Energy Resources in the coming years. We have been encouraged by the Biden Administrations focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. We continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage including hydrogen as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. We support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well. We believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over two decades. As a push for actions to address climate change and acceleration of progress towards decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than NextEra Energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. Now let's turn to the detailed results beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2021. During the quarter we utilized $316 million of reserved amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $578 million. As we previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserved amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses and we expect to continue this trend this year. Let me now turn to Gulf Power which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers and we expect its full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of Gulf Power's major capital investments including the North Florida resiliency connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022 continue to progress well. As a result of these ongoing investments regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending March 2021. Turning to our development and planning efforts. We recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. The 10-year site plan projects that zero emission sources will provide nearly 40% of all energy produced across the combined FPL system in 2030. Largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and success in its coal phase out strategy. FPL expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost effective solar over the next four year and we now control all of the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined FPL system. The site plan also reflects and expect a total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. This plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar paired with battery storage in Florida is an increasingly cost effective form of generation in most parts of the US. As we execute on these opportunities, we project that FPL's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005 and 20% lower than the US Department of Energy's projected industry average in 2030. Moreover we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. During the quarter FPL placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 location across the combined FPL service area from 2019 through 2020. As we previously discussed, we're also developing hydrogen electrolysis project at FPL's Okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into FPL's generation system. There approximately 25 megawatts solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the Okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the US to-date. While these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at FPL. We are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves towards cleaner and more sustainable future. The Florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. Their current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits Case - Shiller index for South Florida up approximately 6% and 10% respectively versus the prior year. Florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolster our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth. During the quarter FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. We estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather related usage for customer. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued economic growth in Northwest Florida. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased to 2.9% year-over-year primarily due to favorable weather. On March 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for Florida Power & Light 2021 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with a test year. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January 2022, $607 million starting in January 2023 and solar base rate adjustments or SoBRA mechanisms in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost effective solar. We are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country with typical residential bills of approximately 13% low state average and importantly nearly 10% lower than in 2006. The four-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advance technology which continues to improve our already best in class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other cost. We believe that FPL's typical residential bills will grow in an average annual rate of about 3.4% from January 2021 through the end of 2025 which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills, 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decreased approximately 1% over the four-year rate plan. The Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for the proceeding beginning with Quality of Service hearing in June and technical hearings in late August. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with a staff of recommendations and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we're open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. Energy Resources reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share up 13% versus the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.04 per share primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted win projects that were commissioned during 2020. The extreme market conditions in Texas in February were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business as well as the favourable performance in the gas infrastructure business. As a reminder when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in Texas as a portfolio and while there were pluses and minuses during these events. We believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well diversified business. All weather impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog including a 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts of four-hour battery storage capacity. In 2020, our market share of signed contracts and collocated solar plus storage assets in US was more than 35% and we're excited about the continued trend and demand for collocated storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector. We also added 916 megawatts of new win projects to our backlog for 2022. In addition, our backlog increased by energy resources share of NextEra Energy Partners planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. With the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter our backlog of signed contracts at Energy Resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts supporting our industry leading long-term growth expectations. We remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the US economy presents for Energy Resources and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications. In addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls. We've recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. This investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to-date show the promise of electrification across our economy and we're excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth and demand for electricity. Consistent with our long-term track record we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission further its efforts to build America's leading transmission company with a closing of its acquisition of GridLiance occurring at the end of last month. GridLiance which owns three FERC regulated transmission utilities spanning six states is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate regulated assets. NextEra Energy Transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and six regional transmission organizations. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the US to support this transmission to a low cost, low carbon economy fueled by renewable energy. Our incorporation of GridLiance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider both to deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2021 GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other segments were roughly flat year-over-year. Long-term financial expectations which we increased and extended to late last year through 2023 remained unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share and we will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023 while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023 we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners which delivered very strong first quarter results with year-over-year growth and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36% respectively. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6375 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis up approximately 15% from a year earlier inclusive of this increased NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the IPO. Further building on that strength, NextEra Energy Partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. This transaction will be NextEra Energy Partners first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. I'll provide additional detail on the transaction in just a few minutes. Turning to the detailed quarterly results. NextEra Energy Partners first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $354 million and cash available for distribution was $184 million. New projects which primarily reflect the assets acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 contributed $27 million of adjusted EBITDA and $13 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. This strong year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from NextEra Energy Partners wind and natural gas pipeline investments in Texas during the February winter storm partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our Genesis project during the quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. The portfolio has a cash available distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers and further enhances the diversity of NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive CAFY yield and be immediately accretive to LP distributions. This transaction demonstrates the NextEra Energy Partners continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and it's enhanced by our ability to take advantage of Energy Resources best in class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the assets. Energy Resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower cost across its renewable assets that it operates. Since 2017 Energy Resources have reduced fleet-wide dollar per megawatt hour O&M cost in its wind fleet by more than 30% and we believe those Energy Resources wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. With Energy Resources operate in the NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets these cost advantages directly benefit LP unit holders. Over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of energy resources operating portfolio platform for both NextEra Energy Partners existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions. In addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. We continue to believe that the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years and expect the portfolio we're acquiring provides additional long-term investments opportunities as well. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million subject to closing adjustments. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million each on a five-year average annual run rate basis beginning in December 31, 2021. We believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing which we use to fund the acquisition along with the existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. Following the recently announced transaction we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cast the expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $680 million respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and includes the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. Energy Resources main significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to deliver on its already best in class run rate for LP distribution growth. Finally, last month we were honored the NextEra was ranked Number 1 in its sector for Fortune magazine's World's Most Admired Company's list for the 14th time in 15 years. Moreover, we're recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values while helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish NextEra Energy's 2021 ESG Report which we believe establishes our full alignment with the taskforce for climate related financial disclosures or TCFD recommendations. We're also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project survey later this year. These enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with a key tenant of ESG which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, I will open up the line for questions. Perfect, thanks Shar. I was going to say yes, the question. But I think its multiple questions in here. So I'll start and obviously John or Jim can jump in, if they want to add something. We are very excited about opportunities in transmission and it is founded on a couple of points that I highlighted in the script. First, is we couldn't be more excited as you well know about the renewables opportunities across the US in the coming decades. A key part of all of those opportunities or at least a lot of those opportunities in later part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond, is some level of build out of transmission in the US beyond what's been accomplished. So both to enable to long-term renewables development but also to capitalize on those opportunities leaves us very interested in transmission. The Energy Resources team has done a terrific job growing that business both through organic opportunities so long-term development efforts identifying opportunities, participating in processes and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and build successfully into line and into operation some of those lines as well as through acquisitions. Obviously with GridLiance being the most recent and Trans Bay Cable not being too much far behind it. I expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market. On the FERC transmission side, we do think there are lot of opportunities to improve how transmission is sided and built across the US and we're optimistic that this administration and this FERC will start to focus on those and I think to go through FERC as well as potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. So a lot of opportunities to invest in the future. Thanks Shar. I think it's really early to comment on the rate case. We just filed. I think you've heard us comment a couple of times, these as U-Haul trucks versus filing requirements that we produce and supply to staff and the interveners and the commission itself to start the process. So we're very early and no doubt all of the key stakeholders just trying to review that information and then we'll see the process unfold really over quite a number of months accommodating with the hearings in August. We are very proud as I highlight in the comments both here and in other venues. We're really proud of the case that the FPL team has put together not just the case itself. But it's built on a foundation of execution not just over the last five years during which we've operated under the settlement agreements but of course years and years before that. So we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process. As it relates to settlements, as you know here in Florida there is a great history of settlement agreements not just with Florida Power & Light Company but other utilities in the state. We do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcomes that meets the need of all stakeholders and historically that is produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. There's a great history of that. We of course will be open to it. But it's very early in this process and again we look forward to being able to put forward our case. We're really excited about the acquisition and we've highlighted both in terms of the financial characteristics of it. One of the things that was particularly attractive about this portfolio when we looked at it is, our teams' ability to add value on the operation and maintenance cost side. Really think about as we bring assets into the portfolio, it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate and so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the Energy Resources management of these assets at NextEra Energy Partners. We've been very excited about NextEra Energy Partners growth outlook for quite some time as we've always indicated our excitement is well founded, just simply looking at the backlog of those operating and signed contracts and then the potential for new contract synergy resources. But have always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set and we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities. I do think there are more opportunities out there, third-party acquisitions on the renewables side. It's an area of focus for us to continue to participate in. but we've got the three ways to grow and to the extent that we can put opportunities to be rather great and we'll take advantage of them overtime. But we also continue to have terrific organic opportunities in NEP particularly as the portfolio grows and then of course the continued success of Energy Resources in the broader market is very positive. Sure. We've already highlighted in terms of cap fee produced for the assets $60 million plus relative to the acquisition price that we highlighted obviously that's subject to closing adjustments. So that's at the project level and then we'll optimize the financing overtime particularly as we think about the rest of the growth expectations for 2021 into 2022. Perfect. Thanks Stephen. Let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter term which would really tie into I think the latter part of your question in comment. The first part which is the latter term view is when we look at substantial deployment of renewable and battery storage and think about how do you further decarbonize the US electricity sector. When we previously ran that analysis just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage. It became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more and more renewables and storage you add, absent other actions. So when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought which is effectively a form of long duration storage that is taking advantage of chief electricity production coming from renewables in some cases excess renewable production at certain times of the day. That substantially changes the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. So that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long duration storage that continues to be very value accretive to customers both in cost and in the performance of clean energy. So that's kind of the starting point, but then coming back to a little bit more nearer term. If you think about how do you decarbonize transportation industrial sectors. The most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells or through hydrogen and hydrogen probably more applicable on the industrial sector particularly for applications that already exist today. And as Jim highlighted the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by Congress is part of the infrastructure package. In the near term we could see a closing of the GAAP perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel based. So yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables for electricity sector, industrial and transportation. But also as you suggested potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself whether it's the electrolyzer or rather forms of creating and distributing the molecules. How much and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots. That both John and the Energy Resources team as well as Eric within Florida Power & Light are thinking through today. How do we do that economically? How do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities? You'll see us continue to place small bets to get experienced to build relationships to gain knowledge and in the short-term that won't add up to heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity. But it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well. From a return standpoint, we do see a differential we have quite for time overall returns between wind and solar from a risk adjusted basis. We're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. In the short-term in terms of backlog John and the Energy Resources team certainly influenced by what I think is the conventional wisdom for a long time, the step downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step down for the investment tax credit on solar or in fact likely to happen. I think our customers now are thinking about that a little differently as discussions in Washington have started to heat up. But as we look what our likely outcomes as Jim was talking through including the potential for extensions of those incentives. I think the key takeaway is, they remain both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. So they remain attractive from our perspective and we continue to focus our development and efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers. Yes Michael, I think it's probably still a little bit too soon. I think most participants in the market are still working through a lot of the implications and learning's from Texas. So I'm not sure there's a lot to be commented on in the near term. It's obviously something we'll stay engaged in the market and participate where it makes sense. But at this point, I think it's too soon. So we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. As I've talked about in the past and you all know, we have a lot of interest across Texas not only wind investment, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments and of course the small retail business. So we've been carefully thinking through all of - whether the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward. Specifically to weatherizing, I don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewable fleet or you're talking about the gas infrastructure side. But on the renewable side keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects and ambient temperature at least for our fleet. I can't speak for everybody was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a P-50 forecast. It was really related to the fact in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days it was preceded by an icing event. So ice was accumulating on our blades and when ice accumulates on the blades it's difficult for them to spin and because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there wasn't an opportunity for that ice to shed. Typically weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. This is something the industry is focused on. There are some - what at this point are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades and given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year and ends up being very cost prohibitive for something that happened very sporadically. So I'm not optimistic that there's a substantial amount due to at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the events. I do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow which obviously was really at the crux of the issues along with not only natural gas, supply shortages but plant issues in the coal fleet and issues in nuclear fleet. So there's opportunities across the market to invest. I'm not sure what you mean by pressure, they're ultimately the calculation for IDRs is one that's known and relates to the overall growth and cash flow within NEP. So it's not specific to where the acquisition source was for the asset. No there's not a difference in terms of the structure and at this point in time NextEra Energy Partners and NextEra Energy with the idea of the structure that's currently in place."

[Operator instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Jason. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. John will provide some opening remarks and will then turn the call over to Kirk for a review of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release, in the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and therefore 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to John.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Before I turn to a discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, I'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in media articles and a related complaint filed in October with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete. Regarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles. With respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including by implication FPL. The FEC process is a confidential, civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so. We plan to file our response seeking dismissal of the FEC complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us. With that behind us, I would like to now discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year in 2022 and both businesses have never been better positioned. The cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last two decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward. At the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. Before IRA, we largely qualified for two federal incentives -- wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits. We always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years. Some years they were extended, others they were not. The uncertainty changed customer behavior and it changed our behavior.  Today, the incentives are clear. They support a broader range of renewable technologies. They are in place for a much longer period of time. And they incentivize a domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the USA, creating new American jobs. In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that, in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders. So today, I am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners and I look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes. In 2022, NextEra Energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. As a result of strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources, we achieved the high-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. NextEra Energy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022, despite a challenging year in the financial markets. In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Utilities Index on a three, five, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the S&P 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both FPL and Energy Resources and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward. We have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 was no exception. Despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in American energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Overcoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. While disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities and I'm extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 in delivering adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14%. During 2022, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in America. Despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class non-fuel O&M cost per megawatt-hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021. We also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills. We placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022 and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023, bringing our total solar buildout to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first two years of our current rate agreement. Our relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1,000 kWh residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in eight years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Ian and Nicole. And during a year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, FPL used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers. Looking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year. With economics driving strong demand for renewables, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the United States. With the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts, net of projects placed in service, and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead. Our continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables, gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at NextEra Energy. Last June, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader U.S. economy. In August, the IRA helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history. Over the next two decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables, and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage. At FPL, our plan is to lower cost for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage and eventually hydrogen. By transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel-switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of Florida achieve energy independence. Our customers have already seen the positive impacts of the IRA on their bills. We estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. This month, those savings started with a one-time $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate based solar projects. With only about 5% of FPL's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio. At April, FPL expects to file its annual Ten-Year Site Plan, which will present our generation resource plan through 2032. Last year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. By incorporating the IRA benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity in this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. We believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future. At Energy Resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices and the broader push toward decarbonization across the economy enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions. These comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and, in addition to  new renewables, can include renewable fuels, hydrogen, and Behind the Meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables. Customers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. And we believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions reduction goals. We are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost-effectively lower emissions. We are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position. We are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way, and we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. Last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog, that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen-related facility in development in the Central United States. Additionally, Energy Resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the Southwest and Southeast. Earlier this month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. In the Southeast, our plan is to support a 140 tons-per-day clean hydrogen facility at our Gulf Clean Energy Center that would be powered by FPL solar projects. In the Southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in Arizona in partnership with Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the United States, with whom we recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the West Coast mobility and industrial end-markets. These are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing. We continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us. At our investor conference in June last year, we announced Energy Resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. In sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then-existing tax law. Typically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior. Then, after tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. Even though tax credits were extended with the IRA, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables. It is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages that today we are extending our development expectations at Energy Resources through 2026. We now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026. If you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new four-year development expectations at Energy Resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous four year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year. To put these numbers into context, just executing at the low-end of our new development expectations through 2026 would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Due to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings per share growth expectations at NextEra Energy by an additional year through 2026. For 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted EPS range. This equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which had another terrific year of execution, while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. For 2022, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by approximately 15% year-over-year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. This growth is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. Our confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the IRA. Against a backdrop that we believe includes at least two decades of clean energy incentives, we expect NextEra Energy Partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both Energy Resources and from third-parties to continue to be robust. NextEra Energy Partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by NextEra Energy Partners for 2024 through 2026. Additionally, earlier this month NextEra Energy Partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interests on two of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million. These transactions are intended to enable NextEra Energy Partners to take advantage of the IRA's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third-parties. With the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, NextEra Energy Partners can now fully access two cash flow streams for unitholders -- project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of PTCs. Taken together, NextEra Energy Partners expects these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders. The significant tailwinds provided by the IRA and Energy Resources' future renewables outlook, combined with NextEra Energy Partners' third-party M&A and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital, even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility. As a result, today we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NextEra Energy Partners by another year. We now see 12% to 15% per year growth and per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We believe that NextEra Energy Partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have never been better positioned. We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade. And we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Kirk, I'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we are announcing this morning. After 20 years with NextEra Energy, Eric Silagy has notified me of his intention to retire from FPL, where he has led the team for 11 years. Eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement and under his leadership, FPL has been transformed into the Nation's largest and most reliable electric utility. Over the last decade, Eric has led the efforts to modernize FPL's generating fleet, making it one of the cleanest, lowest-cost and most fuel-efficient in the country. His commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by FPL's award winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average and the best reliability in the country. Last year during hurricanes Ian and Nicole, I saw firsthand Eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the FPL team to quickly restore power and quickly get the State of Florida back on its feet. Over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, Eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. His advocacy across the State has helped to foster Florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system and grow the next generation of Florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments. I want to thank Eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life. With Eric's departure we are excited to welcome Armando Pimentel back to NextEra Energy as FPL's President and CEO. As you know, Armando previously served as NextEra Energy's and FPL's CFO and the President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. As a lifelong Floridian, Armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. He is also a good friend and colleague who I've worked closely with for many years, and I am confident that under Armando's leadership, FPL will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Eric who will make some personal remarks.\nEric Silagy: Thank you, John. I want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for NextEra Energy. This company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry and I couldn't be more proud of the results that we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. When I joined NextEra Energy in 2003, FPL relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in America. We knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill. Today, that long-term vision has saved FPL customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years. That's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets and helped them to pay for their kids' education, take their families on a vacation or pay for other family expenses. These efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid. And it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations. Ultimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the State of Florida billions of dollars. These are just a few examples of how we have transformed FPL into one of America's cleanest, most affordable and most reliable energy companies. While saying goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, I know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of FPL. The last year has been one of the most challenging of my career given a number of distractions, including two hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few. When John became CEO of NextEra Energy last year, I committed to him that I would stay in my role for at least one more year and I've now satisfied that commitment. In April I will mark my 20th anniversary with NextEra Energy at which point I will have led the FPL team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most CEO's. We have two more years of execution before our next rate setting proceeding, which as all of you know is an all-consuming process and that I just wasn't sure that I could fully commit to. So, I feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of FPL to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years. It has been the greatest honor of my career to lead the FPL team, and I cannot thank our nearly 10,000 FPL employees and thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting our customers first. They have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day. In my opinion, and I'm a little biased, FPL is the best utility in the world. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished, and it is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. I wish John, Armando and the entire FPL team all the best in their future endeavors. And now let me turn the call over to Kirk for more details.\nKirk Crews: Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $763 million, or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. For the full-year 2022, FPL reported net income of $3.7 billion, or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion. For the fourth quarter, FPL's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather as well as an approximately $40 million pre-tax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve. For the full-year 2022, FPL's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth, and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion. Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at FPL in 2022. Beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date later this year. Earlier this week, FPL filed with the Florida Public Service Commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. Under our proposed plan, FPL utilize its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April 2023. Additionally, FPL's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel cost recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to FPL's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022. We believe this proposal is a reflection of FPL's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers. Separately, FPL is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. Under FPL's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in April 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms. Taking both proposals together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of April 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for Florida investor-owned utilities. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs, and Florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although we have seen the growth rate stabilize, three-month average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior-year, including an 11% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. For 2022, FPL's retail sales increased 1% from the prior-year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income of $996 million, or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million, or $0.20 per share. For the full-year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $285 million, or $0.40 per share, and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion, or $1.23 per share. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources full-year GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Energy Resources' full-year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. As we previously highlighted, the Commerce Department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. As a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022. We anticipate that Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023, when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. Our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year-over-year. All other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt balances reflecting growth in the business. Additional details of our full-year 2022 results at Energy Resources are shown on the accompanying slide. As John mentioned, Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar and 670 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals but, perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar, and solar-plus-storage. Today, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the IRA. Our revised expectations are by far the largest expected four-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. The accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers, and we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of China. We believe the Commerce Department's preliminary determination on circumvention of anti-dumping and countervailing duties late last year clarified that solar panels manufactured in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China are not circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. We are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the two-year waiver period. Finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.52 billion, or $0.76 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1 billion, or $0.51 per share, respectively. For the full-year 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.15 billion, or $2.10 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share. For the Corporate & Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full-year were roughly flat compared to the prior-year. As John mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all sectors. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy and this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings. Additionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow and in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year-over-year, despite FPL being under-recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes Ian and Nicole. As a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities. Finally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. As John discussed, today we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.  Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up approximately 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. Fourth quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners' operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year. For the full-year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021. Existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, with the benefits of higher net generation for both wind and solar partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021. NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full-year. Relative to the growth in NextEra Energy Partners' full-year adjusted EBITDA, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit, or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year-over-year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the IPO. During 2022, NextEra Energy Partners executed several low-cost financings continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. During the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years, to be funded by the investor's share of ongoing portfolio cash flows. In December, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon, which along with the capped call entered into at the time of the financing provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the NEP unit price at the time of issuance. The implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. These transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of NextEra Energy Partners' successful financing execution throughout 2022. In May 2022, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available. With this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners still has $6 billion of Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for maturities or net new issuances. Taken together, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set which has expanded as a result of the IRA. This significant opportunity set and NextEra Energy Partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners' run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution at December 31, 2023 remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near-term and long-term. Near-term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. Long-term, we believe that the low cost of renewables combined with other clean energy solutions enabled in part by the IRA provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. So just a couple questions on the management changes. So you don't appear to be making any connection between the investigation in Eric's retirement. Could you just confirm if that's correct or not? And then I guess secondly, just thoughts on -- often with these successions you'd bring somebody kind of internally up. So maybe thoughts on bringing Armando back who we know well, but just as opposed to the kind of bringing someone internally up? Thanks.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, thanks, Steve. First of all, on your first question on connection, we're not making a connection. Eric, when I was first chosen to succeed Jim, Eric, and I had a conversation. Eric said, look I will give you a one-year commitment stay at the company. And we would talk about it at the end of the year. Eric satisfied that commitment to me. 2022 obviously was a year with a lot of challenges. The distractions Eric went through in his prepared remarks. But when you think about all the challenges that that he had to overcome with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation and the supply chain and on the media allegations and all those things, I think it took a toll on Eric that that year and gave me his retirement notice. And it's, the way I look at it is it's a little earlier than would've hope Eric, Eric would've wanted to do it. And so we have a very deep bench over at FPL. I'm going to your second question now. A very deep bench at FPL. We have a lot of terrific folks that we could move into Eric's role. We have one individual in particular, Christopher Chapel, he is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer as part of the transition. We're bringing Armando back as well. And Armando has been just a terrific friend to me. I have a lot of respect for Armando. I had the good fortune to work with Armando for roughly 15 years. And I think he will do a great job of bringing Christopher along, who I think in the future will just make an outstanding CEO of FPL. But he, Christopher has been running customer service. He needs to get a little bit more experience on the operations side and on -- and working with the regulatory team. And then on the financial side, getting us ready for the rate case. And I think the combination of Armando working together with Christopher that is a very powerful team, and they will do a tremendous job working together to execute on behalf of FPL. And I think Christopher has a very, very bright future with our company. And all of you will have a chance to get to know him and to meet him in the near future. Some of you have had that chance in the past, and I think that should be a familiar name to some of our investors.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, definitely. Thanks.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. And Steve, I want to just to Eric to say a few words as well.\nEric Silagy: Steve, let me jump in here a little bit. Look\u2026\nSteve Fleishman: Yes.\nEric Silagy: Because I'm sure you can appreciate these kind of decisions are never easy, and there's no ever perfect time. As John said with a transition of leadership last year, I gave John a commitment that I'd be here for at least a year. Didn't have any real hard timeline set, but I've been in the Chair for 11 years. This will be going into my 12th year. And my predecessor had been in the job for 10 years. Jim had been in his job for 10 years, before that Lew Hay had been in his job for 10 years. And as I look forward to, this is the kind of job that you have to plan ahead and we're getting ready to go in another rate case cycle. I mean, that's a multi-year type of approach. And so to go forward longer means I'm really committing through 2026. So a lot of factors come into play. John touched on all of the challenges in 2022. I'm really, really proud of how the team handled them. But it's a 24-hour day job. And there are a lot of challenges that we successfully managed, but it's a decision that is not easy, but I feel good about moving forward and putting -- doing it when the company is in its strongest financial and operational position it's ever been in. With a very strong leadership team, I think that's the right time to do it.\nSteve Fleishman: Right. Well, I appreciate that color. Thanks. That's the main question we've been getting from people. So just one other thing on the wind -- excuse me, on the backlog, it seems like there's a big increase in wind expectations for the next four years, or the main driver of the higher backlog. Could you just give more color on what's driving? Is that just the extension of the credits or other things leading to more wind expectation through '26?\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca and I'll chime in on that. It is exactly what John and Kirk highlighted and what we've been talking about for the last couple of months following IRA. With IRA provisions, we now have extensions of incentives now through the end of the decades well decade plus, but just looking into visibility, it's exceptional now through the end of the decade and likely well beyond that. And it is a big change specifically for wind in this timeframe adding the 100% production tax credit now, obviously through this expectation, windows through it fully. And it's also supported by the backdrop of what I also have highlighted to you all. And John talked about in his remarks about all of the positive follow on effects from strong incentives on renewables and through the introduction of a hydrogen production tax credit. We're starting to see substantial demand and positive engagement around renewables to create green hydrogen and hydrogen related products thereafter. So our development team is busy having the types of conversations we've never had before, and we can't be more excited about what's ahead. And that's for wind solar storage and the hydrogen products that we're talking about.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team, and congrats, Eric on your stellar career. Armando, welcome back. Feels a little bit like when Maury came back in 2009 here, I must admit. Maybe just related to some of the changes here, just to follow-up on that super quick. First off is Armando committing to the full process here, as you alluded to the rate case cycle being a little bit protracted. And then related to that what is the final timing in terms of this internal process that you guys had underway per the 8-K and is that impacted at all by this pending FEC process that you allude to taking upwards of the balance of the year here?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, let me go ahead and take those, Julien. This is John. So first of all on -- with Armando, Armando's committed, he's coming back as our CEO and President of FPL. Armando's committed. So let me just say that. And again, as I said, he is inheriting just a terrific team. I would say easily -- in my own belief, the best team in the industry, and it's a team Eric built and did an outstanding job building, and there's just a lot of strength there. And Armando's has a good fortune of being able to lead that organization. And with Christopher Chapel, as I said too, taking on that that Chief Operating Officer role, I think that's quite a one, two punch that we're going to have over at FPL combined with the existing strength that we already have on the bench there. And the other thing I'll mention is that, Eric, we have the good fortune of Eric staying through the middle of May, which will help ensure a very smooth transition for both Armando moving into to that role. And for Christopher, having a chance to step up, and Eric will do a great job on that transition, and making sure all the right relationships are transitioned as part of that. That's the first piece. The second piece you talked about the internal process and timing. First of all, let me just cover it one more time. I mean, we are substantially complete. On the Florida side, as I said on my comments, we do not believe that FPL would be found liable of a federal campaign finance violation based on our investigation. And second, with regard to the FEC process, let me just say a few words about the FEC process, just so everybody understands exactly what it is. The Federal Election Commission has civil enforcement authority. Anybody in the United States can file a claim with the FEC. And given the political environment that we're in today, I would certainly expect even an uptick in more claims being filed with the FEC, but any citizen can file a complaint. That's where we are right now. A citizen, special interest group filed a complaint. There is no formal legal proceeding or any proceeding with the FEC right now. The FEC will take 12 to 18 months to decide whether or not there is a reason to believe that they should investigate this further. And we will file a motion for dismissal. We think that a claim like this that's based solely on media reports and allegations is not the type of a claim the FEC should take up. If you read the complaint, the complaint details five different scenarios, those, if you add up all the contributions in those scenarios, they don't exceed $1.3 million. And so, when we look at the FEC process as a whole and the FEC complaint as a whole, we do not believe that the federal allegations, taken as a whole, as I said would have a material impact on our business.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then just super quickly, if I can, just with respect to the originations here, the 1.7 since the third quarter call, this seems a little bit down from the last quarterly call update in the slides. Can you comment a little bit about the trends? Obviously, I'm cognizant of the comments you made about the overall expectations through '26. How do you think about that materializing the pace and just what customer feedback is in putting in orders, \"now versus in subsequent period\"?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, let me take that, Julien. The first thing I would say is the demand for renewables is as strong as ever. When I look at the opportunities that the development organization has right now, they are significant. I mentioned in my remarks the term sheet we signed on the 800 megawatt facility in the Central part of the U.S. for a green hydrogen facility that we didn't even count, for example. And we have a lot of interest around hydrogen right now that's going to fuel a lot of renewable opportunities. The C&I market is extremely strong. We're just seeing a lot of demand across the board. And so I think that's why you see with the revised development expectations, 42 gigawatts on the high end, oh my gosh, I think those of you that have been following the company for a long time, 42 Gigs, that's a 15% uptick on the last four year set that we had, I mean, just to put it in perspective, I mean, FPL's total generation fleet is 27 gigawatts, so to 42 gigs over a four-year period, hopefully that provides a little color and context.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nConstantine Lednev: Good morning, team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar and congrats on a great quarter, and just wanted to wish Eric the best in the next steps. Certainly, appreciate that.\nEric Silagy: Thanks, Shar.\nConstantine Lednev: Maybe as a quick follow-up to Julien's question, and maybe just on the -- and you've noted prior impacts of the IRA having some pull and push on the demand for renewables, and maybe just specifically on the details of the cadence of the growth to reach those '26 targets front end loaded, backend loaded, anything there?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, hi, Constantine. It's Rebecca. I think the best place to point you to is the development expectations slide that Kirk went through. It's Slide 12 in the materials, and it lays out the ranges by technology for '23 and '24, and then '25 and '26. And obviously there's a significant increase in going into '25 and '26 really for all the things that we're talking about, the significant momentum, also a lot of resolution over the last couple of months and clarity around some of the supply chain disruption that we've seen on the solar side. So it is building and the momentum as John highlighted so well remains exceptionally strong on the development and origination side. So I'm really excited about everything that we see in our traditional businesses as well as the commercial and industrial sector. And then of course, the burgeoning opportunities that we see on the green hydrogen and related products side.\nConstantine Lednev: Excellent. And on a related note on the kind of upside from repowering opportunities, do you have any thoughts on kind of solar and storage type of repowering? I know that wind is starting to make it into the plan. Just curious on the other side.\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, we're looking at it and there's, we think there's opportunities over time to repower both battery storage projects as well as on the solar side, there they can be a little bit more complex. And we're certainly looking for some guidance as we go through this year from treasury on this point, as well as others that will be helpful in giving us context. But some of this is also timing. So as you get more mature projects, obviously 10 years on the wind side, five plus years on the solar side will be opportunities then really to expand the horizon for repowering. But as I've talked to our team, every day we're looking at our existing generation portfolio, and I see more opportunities today to enhance the value of our existing portfolio than we've ever seen before. That of course includes repowering, it includes adding battery storage, it includes thinking differently because of the exciting opportunities around green hydrogen about even citing some of those load opportunities, the electrolysis equipment to produce that hydrogen at existing assets. And we're also making investments in transmission across a variety of the integrated system operation markets to be able to add transmission to increase the value of the existing portfolio. So we think there's tons of opportunities and so much more certainty looking forward than we've ever had before because of the clarity around the incentives.\nConstantine Lednev: Excellent, thanks so much. Yes, we're running a little bit late, so I'll jump back in the queue.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks.\nOperator: Sorry, the next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on just your latest experience with access to solar panel supply whether there's any risks that you see for executing on this year's development plan and how the UFLPA law has been impacting projects?\nKirk Crews: Sure. Hi, Dave. This is Kirk, I'll take that. So the last time we spoke, I believe was on the third quarter earnings call. And we shared with you that as our integrated supply chain team had worked and certainly had a challenging year in 2022, but as we highlighted on the earnings call today despite that challenging year, they did a really admirable job. We were able to still put into service 5,000 megawatts. And I think that really speaks to their ability to navigate that disruption. And certainly part of that disruption was you highlighted, which was that the challenges around the ports and trying to work through the panels that had been detained and at the ports. And as I mentioned, the challenges around -- in the third quarter that we highlighted with some of the panels being detained there, what we've seen since the third quarter call is some positive improvement. We've seen some of the panels that had previously been detained, released. And so I would describe it as positive movement. We continue to see each day some positive movement. So we're continuing to monitoring it. We're watching it closely. The team is actively working with our suppliers and continuing to monitor it. But compared to where we were in the third quarter I think we're cautiously optimistic that we are seeing progress and at least from our perspective, we continue to feel like it's something that we can manage in terms of continuing to deliver for our customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks for that color. And on the renewables development program, I was wondering if green hydrogen is starting to have an impact on the back end of the plan in terms of influencing the renewables demand outlook yet, like in 2026, are you starting to kind of weave in expected demand on renewables from green hydrogen at that point?\nRebecca Kujawa: It's certainly something, it's Rebecca. It's obviously something that we considered when we are setting the development expectations and what we laid out today for you all. I can tell you from a practical standpoint, it very much is starting to show up in the conversations that we're looking at including the 800 megawatt term sheet that we signed in recent weeks for a project that would be expected to COD in 2026. At this point, I think there are a number of folks and ourselves included working hard to put the right development opportunities together. But it is a very active market. We're really excited about opportunities to partner with key folks, Linde among them, as we talked about in the call, but others as well to put forward terrific projects and really bring forward the promise of this technology that we've now been talking about. But it's really coming to reality. I think '26 is probably on the earlier side of what we ultimately will see as a significant ramp-up going into the end of the decade where there's more opportunity to have supply ramp-up for electrolyzers as well as other related equipment for some of those green hydrogen related products as well as working through the development opportunities and establishing the ultimate customers for these products. But everything I see is really exciting and really starting to take shape just now a number of months after the IRA provisions were ultimately passed into law.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca and I'll chime in on that. It is exactly what John and Kirk highlighted and what we've been talking about for the last couple of months following IRA. With IRA provisions, we now have extensions of incentives now through the end of the decades well decade plus, but just looking into visibility, it's exceptional now through the end of the decade and likely well beyond that. And it is a big change specifically for wind in this timeframe adding the 100% production tax credit now, obviously through this expectation, windows through it fully. And it's also supported by the backdrop of what I also have highlighted to you all. And John talked about in his remarks about all of the positive follow on effects from strong incentives on renewables and through the introduction of a hydrogen production tax credit. We're starting to see substantial demand and positive engagement around renewables to create green hydrogen and hydrogen related products thereafter. So our development team is busy having the types of conversations we've never had before, and we can't be more excited about what's ahead. And that's for wind solar storage and the hydrogen products that we're talking about. Thanks, Steve. Yes, hi, Constantine. It's Rebecca. I think the best place to point you to is the development expectations slide that Kirk went through. It's Slide 12 in the materials, and it lays out the ranges by technology for '23 and '24, and then '25 and '26. And obviously there's a significant increase in going into '25 and '26 really for all the things that we're talking about, the significant momentum, also a lot of resolution over the last couple of months and clarity around some of the supply chain disruption that we've seen on the solar side. So it is building and the momentum as John highlighted so well remains exceptionally strong on the development and origination side. So I'm really excited about everything that we see in our traditional businesses as well as the commercial and industrial sector. And then of course, the burgeoning opportunities that we see on the green hydrogen and related products side. Yes, we're looking at it and there's, we think there's opportunities over time to repower both battery storage projects as well as on the solar side, there they can be a little bit more complex. And we're certainly looking for some guidance as we go through this year from treasury on this point, as well as others that will be helpful in giving us context. But some of this is also timing. So as you get more mature projects, obviously 10 years on the wind side, five plus years on the solar side will be opportunities then really to expand the horizon for repowering. But as I've talked to our team, every day we're looking at our existing generation portfolio, and I see more opportunities today to enhance the value of our existing portfolio than we've ever seen before. That of course includes repowering, it includes adding battery storage, it includes thinking differently because of the exciting opportunities around green hydrogen about even citing some of those load opportunities, the electrolysis equipment to produce that hydrogen at existing assets. And we're also making investments in transmission across a variety of the integrated system operation markets to be able to add transmission to increase the value of the existing portfolio. So we think there's tons of opportunities and so much more certainty looking forward than we've ever had before because of the clarity around the incentives. Thanks. It's certainly something, it's Rebecca. It's obviously something that we considered when we are setting the development expectations and what we laid out today for you all. I can tell you from a practical standpoint, it very much is starting to show up in the conversations that we're looking at including the 800 megawatt term sheet that we signed in recent weeks for a project that would be expected to COD in 2026. At this point, I think there are a number of folks and ourselves included working hard to put the right development opportunities together. But it is a very active market.

            "content": "Thank you, John. I want to start by saying what an honor and a privilege it has been to work for NextEra Energy. This company's performance has been unprecedented in our industry and I couldn't be more proud of the results that we have delivered for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. When I joined NextEra Energy in 2003, FPL relied more on foreign oil to generate electricity than any other utility in America. We knew that we needed to modernize our generation portfolio and we recognized that building a clean, low-cost and fuel-efficient fleet was a great decision for our customers as it would save them money on their fuel bill. Today, that long-term vision has saved FPL customers a cumulative $14 billion over the last 20 years. That's $14 billion that never came out of our customers' pockets and helped them to pay for their kids' education, take their families on a vacation or pay for other family expenses. These efforts began by thinking of ourselves more as a technology company than a utility, finding new and innovative ways to run the grid. And it led to improved reliability, reduced operating costs and a totally different way to approach hurricane restorations. Ultimately, this new way of thinking led to faster restoration times, which has saved the State of Florida billions of dollars. These are just a few examples of how we have transformed FPL into one of America's cleanest, most affordable and most reliable energy companies. While saying goodbye to such a great organization is always difficult, I know that now is the right time for me to hand over the reins of FPL. The last year has been one of the most challenging of my career given a number of distractions, including two hurricanes and significant supply chain and inflationary pressures, to name just a few. When John became CEO of NextEra Energy last year, I committed to him that I would stay in my role for at least one more year and I've now satisfied that commitment. In April I will mark my 20th anniversary with NextEra Energy at which point I will have led the FPL team for going on 12 years, which is well beyond the tenure of most CEO's. We have two more years of execution before our next rate setting proceeding, which as all of you know is an all-consuming process and that I just wasn't sure that I could fully commit to. So, I feel it's best for the transition to take place now and for new leadership to take the helm of FPL to ensure consistent management heading into a very busy next couple of years. It has been the greatest honor of my career to lead the FPL team, and I cannot thank our nearly 10,000 FPL employees and thousands more of our retirees enough for their hard work, for their dedication and for always putting our customers first. They have served our communities and our state with distinction and always challenged themselves to get better every single day. In my opinion, and I'm a little biased, FPL is the best utility in the world. I am so proud of what our team has accomplished, and it is extremely well positioned to continue to deliver exceptional value to both customers, shareholders and to the state. I wish John, Armando and the entire FPL team all the best in their future endeavors. And now let me turn the call over to Kirk for more details. Steve, let me jump in here a little bit. Look... Because I'm sure you can appreciate these kind of decisions are never easy, and there's no ever perfect time. As John said with a transition of leadership last year, I gave John a commitment that I'd be here for at least a year. Didn't have any real hard timeline set, but I've been in the Chair for 11 years. This will be going into my 12th year. And my predecessor had been in the job for 10 years. Jim had been in his job for 10 years, before that Lew Hay had been in his job for 10 years. And as I look forward to, this is the kind of job that you have to plan ahead and we're getting ready to go in another rate case cycle. I mean, that's a multi-year type of approach. And so to go forward longer means I'm really committing through 2026. So a lot of factors come into play. John touched on all of the challenges in 2022. I'm really, really proud of how the team handled them. But it's a 24-hour day job. And there are a lot of challenges that we successfully managed, but it's a decision that is not easy, but I feel good about moving forward and putting -- doing it when the company is in its strongest financial and operational position it's ever been in. With a very strong leadership team, I think that's the right time to do it. Thanks, Shar."

            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. Let's now turn to the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $763 million, or $0.38 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. For the full-year 2022, FPL reported net income of $3.7 billion, or $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.24 per share versus 2021. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% for 2022. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth in regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four-year term of our current rate agreement. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full-year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.2 billion. For the fourth quarter, FPL's net income was impacted by a number of factors, including favorable weather as well as an approximately $40 million pre-tax contribution to charitable foundations that will allow us to continue to support the communities that we serve. For the full-year 2022, FPL's year-over-year net income growth of nearly $500 million was aided by favorable weather, increased customer growth, and effective cost management that supported our ability to continue to deploy smart capital for the benefit of customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be 11.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter, we did not use any reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2022 balance of $1.45 billion. Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest solar expansions and successfully met our solar deployment objectives at FPL in 2022. Beyond solar, construction on our green hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center remains on schedule as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date later this year. Earlier this week, FPL filed with the Florida Public Service Commission its proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs incurred in 2022. Under our proposed plan, FPL utilize its strong balance sheet to spread these unrecovered 2022 fuel costs over a 21-month period beginning in April 2023. Additionally, FPL's proposed plan would further benefit customers by offsetting the 2022 fuel cost recovery by approximately $1 billion this year based on the recent drop in projected natural gas prices compared to FPL's original 2023 projections made in the third quarter of 2022. We believe this proposal is a reflection of FPL's customer-centric strategy to navigate challenging environments for the benefit of customers. Separately, FPL is also seeking recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of storm costs incurred in 2022. Under FPL's proposal, the storm costs would be recovered over a 12-month period starting in April 2023 to reduce the potential customer bill impacts that could result from the simultaneous recovery of charges related to future storms. Taking both proposals together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills as of April 2023 will remain well below the projected national average and the projected average for Florida investor-owned utilities. The Florida economy remains strong. Over the last 10 years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 6% compound annual growth rate. The GDP of Florida is roughly $1.4 trillion, which is up approximately 10% from 2021. At the same time, Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the nation. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 600,000 new private sector jobs, and Florida's labor force participation rate continues to improve at a faster rate than the rest of the country. Although we have seen the growth rate stabilize, three-month average Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth in new building permits by roughly 6%. Other measures of confidence in the Florida economy have meaningfully improved versus the prior-year, including an 11% improvement in Florida's retail sales index and a roughly 2% decline in mortgage delinquencies. During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 74,000 from the comparable prior-year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 2.1% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by a favorable weather comparison. For 2022, FPL's retail sales increased 1% from the prior-year on a weather-normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth. Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income of $996 million, or $0.50 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $402 million, or $0.20 per share. For the full-year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $285 million, or $0.40 per share, and adjusted earnings of approximately $2.44 billion, or $1.23 per share. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources full-year GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Energy Resources' full-year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased by $0.11 versus 2021. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.04 per share due to continued growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. As we previously highlighted, the Commerce Department's decision to investigate circumvention claims led to delays in the development of renewables, which effectively pushed out the completion of certain projects that we previously anticipated in 2022. As a result, contributions from new investments were negatively impacted in 2022. We anticipate that Energy Resources' adjusted earnings per share contributions from new investments will be much stronger in 2023, when we expect many of these delayed projects will be completed. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.12 versus 2021, primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. Our existing clean energy assets also increased results by $0.02 per share year-over-year. All other net impacts decreased results by $0.07 year-over-year, driven primarily by higher debt balances reflecting growth in the business. Additional details of our full-year 2022 results at Energy Resources are shown on the accompanying slide. As John mentioned, Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, signing approximately 8,030 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects. Since the last call, we have originated approximately 1,700 megawatts of renewables and storage projects, including approximately 300 megawatts of wind, 730 megawatts of solar and 670 megawatts of battery storage. Our origination performance in 2022 reflects continued high demand among all customer classes for clean energy solutions that not only help achieve their renewable energy goals but, perhaps more importantly, allow our customers to save on energy costs by switching to lower-cost forms of generation like wind, solar, and solar-plus-storage. Today, we are extending our renewables development expectations through 2026 as a result of our tremendous progress in 2022, strong continued origination success and the strong market demand for low-cost renewables driven in part by the IRA. Our revised expectations are by far the largest expected four-year development program in our history and reflect our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position and the continued acceleration of renewables penetration across the country. The accompanying slide provides additional details on our new expectations and where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As you know, the industry has faced significant supply chain challenges and disruption over the past year and yet our integrated supply chain and engineering and construction teams demonstrated their resiliency by continuing to execute for our customers, and we have been working for over a year with our suppliers to manufacture wafers outside of China. We believe the Commerce Department's preliminary determination on circumvention of anti-dumping and countervailing duties late last year clarified that solar panels manufactured in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China are not circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. We are confident that we can source panels consistent with these guidelines by the end of the two-year waiver period. Finally, we continue to advance discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.52 billion, or $0.76 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1 billion, or $0.51 per share, respectively. For the full-year 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $4.15 billion, or $2.10 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.74 billion or $2.90 per share. For the Corporate & Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full-year were roughly flat compared to the prior-year. As John mentioned, we invested more than $19 billion in our businesses in 2022, which we expect will again place NextEra Energy among the top capital investors in the U.S. across all sectors. Capital recycling remains an important part of our financing strategy and this year, we recycled more than $5 billion of capital through asset sales and tax equity financings. Additionally, as we have often highlighted, our underlying businesses generate significant cash flow and in 2022, our operating cash flow grew more than 9% year-over-year, despite FPL being under-recovered for fuel costs and incurring restoration costs for hurricanes Ian and Nicole. As a result of this strong cash generation, we proactively paid down nearly $3 billion in 2023 maturities. Finally, we ended the year with $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. As a reminder, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. As John discussed, today we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share expectations for 2023 through 2025 and introducing expectations for 2026. Details of our new financial expectations are included in the accompanying slide. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2021 to 2026, we expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.  Let me now turn to the detailed financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $360 million, up approximately 12% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior-year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions. Fourth quarter cash available for distribution was $74 million. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners' operating expenses and interest expense on project debt are typically higher in the fourth quarter versus the first three quarters of the year. For the full-year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.65 billion, up 21% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the full contribution from new projects acquired in late 2021. Existing projects added approximately $13 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, with the benefits of higher net generation for both wind and solar partially offset by relatively higher operating and maintenance costs versus 2021. NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution was $634 million for the full-year. Relative to the growth in NextEra Energy Partners' full-year adjusted EBITDA, its cash available for distribution from existing projects was also impacted by relatively higher allocation of production tax credits to investors due to favorable wind resource versus 2021. Over the past five years, NextEra Energy Partners' cash available for distribution has grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 20%. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8125 per common unit, or $3.25 per unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% year-over-year and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2022. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by more than 330% since the IPO. During 2022, NextEra Energy Partners executed several low-cost financings continuing its successful track record of accessing attractive sources of capital to support growth for unitholders. During the fourth quarter, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a new convertible equity portfolio financing for approximately $900 million with a low implied cash coupon of roughly 2.8% for up to 10 years, to be funded by the investor's share of ongoing portfolio cash flows. In December, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new convertible notes with a 2.5% coupon, which along with the capped call entered into at the time of the financing provides unitholders with dilution protection for up to 50% accretion versus the NEP unit price at the time of issuance. The implied total cost of the convertible notes represents the most favorable spread to an alternative debt issuance in our history. These transactions executed during the fourth quarter were a continuation of NextEra Energy Partners' successful financing execution throughout 2022. In May 2022, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility to approximately $2.5 billion, nearly all of which is currently available. With this available revolving credit capacity and the final funding of approximately $180 million expected from the 2022 convertible equity portfolio financing, NextEra Energy Partners enters 2023 with significant financing capacity to fund future growth. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners still has $6 billion of Forward Starting Interest Rate Swaps, which is more than enough to cover its corporate maturities through 2027 and will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for maturities or net new issuances. Taken together, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners is extremely well positioned with significant interest rate protection and ample liquidity to finance future growth and to capture a meaningful share of the long-term opportunity set which has expanded as a result of the IRA. This significant opportunity set and NextEra Energy Partners' meaningful financing flexibility provides us with confidence in our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for unitholders over the coming years. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we now see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026, which is an additional year beyond our prior expectations, driven by the partnership's tremendous long-term growth visibility. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners' run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution at December 31, 2023 remain unchanged. Year-end 2023 run-rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and cash available for distribution of $770 million to $860 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2024 contributions expected from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As a reminder, all our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees, as we treat these as operating expense. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near-term and long-term. Near-term, the progress we made in 2022 reinforces our growth outlook and sets the foundation for continuing to deliver on our financial expectations. Long-term, we believe that the low cost of renewables combined with other clean energy solutions enabled in part by the IRA provides us with unprecedented visibility to extend our track record of delivering long-term growth for our shareholders and unitholders, and we could not be more excited about our future. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions. Sure. Hi, Dave. This is Kirk, I'll take that. So the last time we spoke, I believe was on the third quarter earnings call. And we shared with you that as our integrated supply chain team had worked and certainly had a challenging year in 2022, but as we highlighted on the earnings call today despite that challenging year, they did a really admirable job. We were able to still put into service 5,000 megawatts. And I think that really speaks to their ability to navigate that disruption. And certainly part of that disruption was you highlighted, which was that the challenges around the ports and trying to work through the panels that had been detained and at the ports. And as I mentioned, the challenges around -- in the third quarter that we highlighted with some of the panels being detained there, what we've seen since the third quarter call is some positive improvement. We've seen some of the panels that had previously been detained, released. And so I would describe it as positive movement. We continue to see each day some positive movement. So we're continuing to monitoring it. We're watching it closely. The team is actively working with our suppliers and continuing to monitor it. But compared to where we were in the third quarter I think we're cautiously optimistic that we are seeing progress and at least from our perspective, we continue to feel like it's something that we can manage in terms of continuing to deliver for our customers."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. Before I turn to a discussion of our financial results and the future growth prospects, I'd like to make some comments on the status of our review. As a reminder, we reported last quarter that we were reviewing allegations of Florida state and federal campaign finance law violations raised in media articles and a related complaint filed in October with the Federal Election Commission. Our review of information reasonably available to us is now substantially complete. Regarding the Florida allegations, based on information in our possession, we believe that FPL would not be found liable for any of the Florida campaign finance law violations as alleged in the media articles. With respect to the FEC complaint, you may recall that it was filed by a special interest group and primarily relies on media articles that allege certain violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act by various parties, including by implication FPL. The FEC process is a confidential, civil administrative process with an investigation only commencing if the FEC votes to do so. We plan to file our response seeking dismissal of the FEC complaint in the next few weeks and do not believe it is appropriate for a complaint such as this to move forward. The total amount of contributions referenced in the complaint is less than $1.3 million and we do not expect that allegations of federal campaign finance law violations taken as a whole would be material to us. With that behind us, I would like to now discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 financial results and future growth prospects. Both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners had a terrific year in 2022 and both businesses have never been better positioned. The cost and efficiency of new renewables have improved significantly over the last two decades, while natural gas prices have seen an increase over the past year with volatility likely to continue going forward. At the same time, landmark renewables legislation was entered into law last fall. After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, we often said it was transformational for our industry and our business. Before IRA, we largely qualified for two federal incentives -- wind production tax credits and solar investment tax credits. We always had the challenge of planning the business with those federal incentives expected to phase down and expire in a few months or years. Some years they were extended, others they were not. The uncertainty changed customer behavior and it changed our behavior.  Today, the incentives are clear. They support a broader range of renewable technologies. They are in place for a much longer period of time. And they incentivize a domestic supply chain that will further reduce the cost of renewables that are made in the USA, creating new American jobs. In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost clean energy solutions, in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that, in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders. So today, I am excited to share that we are extending our financial expectations for an additional year at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners and I look forward to sharing more details on those expectations in a few minutes. In 2022, NextEra Energy continued its long track record of outstanding execution, delivering full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.90, up nearly 14% from 2021. As a result of strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources, we achieved the high-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10% for our shareholders, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. NextEra Energy outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 10% in 2022, despite a challenging year in the financial markets. In terms of total shareholder return, NextEra Energy has outperformed the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Utilities Index on a three, five, 10 and 15-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we have outperformed nearly all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and more than tripled the average total shareholder return of the index. Over the same period, we have outperformed 75% of the companies in the S&P 500, while nearly tripling the average total shareholder return of the index. We are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, but we remain intensely focused on execution at both FPL and Energy Resources and we remain committed to delivering long-term growth for shareholders going forward. We have a long history of executing and delivering on our commitments, even in periods of uncertainty and disruption, and 2022 was no exception. Despite a challenging macro environment, we invested more than $19 billion in American energy infrastructure, while maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Overcoming supply chain challenges, we constructed and placed into service roughly 5,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects, demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our team's expertise and competitive advantages. While disruption created some near-term challenges, it also created opportunities and I'm extremely proud of our team's execution in 2022 in delivering adjusted EPS growth of nearly 14%. During 2022, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, while delivering on what we believe is the best customer value proposition in America. Despite inflationary pressures, we further reduced our already best-in-class non-fuel O&M cost per megawatt-hour by approximately 8.6% versus 2021. We also continued our investments in solar generation that can reduce the variable fuel component of our customer bills. We placed into service approximately 450 megawatts of cost-effective solar during 2022 and we anticipate commissioning another roughly 1,200 megawatts of low-cost solar in 2023, bringing our total solar buildout to roughly 1.7 gigawatts within the first two years of our current rate agreement. Our relentless focus on productivity and making smart capital investments for the benefit of customers is a significant part of what has kept our typical 1,000 kWh residential customer bills the lowest among Florida investor-owned utilities and more than 30% below the national average. FPL has also continued to provide exceptional service reliability and was recognized for the seventh time in eight years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation. Our team responded exceptionally well in response to hurricanes Ian and Nicole. And during a year of high inflation and high natural gas prices, FPL used its strong balance sheet to provide bill relief for its customers. Looking forward, we remain committed to providing clean, affordable, and reliable service to our customers for many years to come. Energy Resources also had a terrific year in 2022, delivering adjusted earnings growth of nearly 11% versus the prior year. With economics driving strong demand for renewables, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding more than 8,000 megawatts to our backlog as we continue to capitalize on the ongoing clean energy transition that is occurring across the United States. With the significant net additions over the last year, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at a year-end record of approximately 19 gigawatts, net of projects placed in service, and provides strong visibility into the growth that lies ahead. Our continued execution, combined with the long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the strong market backdrop for low-cost renewables, gives us more confidence in our long-term outlook at NextEra Energy. Last June, we laid out our vision and strategy to decarbonize both ourselves and the broader U.S. economy. In August, the IRA helped provide more certainty and flexibility to plan for growth than at any other time in our history. Over the next two decades, we are well positioned to continue our track record of creating long-term value for shareholders through additional renewables and storage investments, expansion into new markets and products that enable even more renewables, and organic growth opportunities to optimize our existing fleet by repowering assets and co-locating storage. At FPL, our plan is to lower cost for customers by accretively deploying capital into low-cost solar, storage and eventually hydrogen. By transforming our generation fleet and continuing our decades-long strategy of fuel-switching, we will not only help customers by keeping bills low but also help the state of Florida achieve energy independence. Our customers have already seen the positive impacts of the IRA on their bills. We estimate that solar production tax credits are expected to save customers roughly $400 million over the term of our current rate agreement. This month, those savings started with a one-time $36 million refund on customer bills for our completed 2022 rate based solar projects. With only about 5% of FPL's generation mix coming from solar today, we are still in the early stages of building out our low-cost solar portfolio. At April, FPL expects to file its annual Ten-Year Site Plan, which will present our generation resource plan through 2032. Last year's plan included roughly 9,400 megawatts of new solar capacity through 2031, including roughly 4,600 megawatts of additional solar after 2025. By incorporating the IRA benefits, we expect the post-2025 new solar capacity in this year's plan will more than double what it was last year. We believe low-cost solar will also provide a valuable hedge for our customers against rising natural gas prices in the future. At Energy Resources, the combination of low-cost renewables, higher natural gas prices and the broader push toward decarbonization across the economy enables our strategy to serve both utilities and commercial and industrial customers with comprehensive clean energy solutions. These comprehensive clean energy solutions are often complex and, in addition to  new renewables, can include renewable fuels, hydrogen, and Behind the Meter projects, all of which are expected to ultimately create even greater demand for renewables. Customers are looking for long-term partnerships with customized solutions at a scale unlike anything we have seen in the past. And we believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to serve these complex customer needs in a way that helps them both save money on their energy bills and meet their emissions reduction goals. We are particularly excited about the potential for green hydrogen and the role it will play as a solution to help commercial and industrial customers cost-effectively lower emissions. We are building the algorithms and tools to identify and optimize the best green hydrogen sites around the country and leverage our significant interconnection and land inventory position. We are using the skills and capabilities that we have developed over the decades that we have led the renewables industry to participate in emerging clean hydrogen markets in a big way, and we are already starting to see some of our early efforts materialize. Last week, we signed a term sheet for approximately 800 megawatts of new solar generation, which we have not included in our backlog, that is expected to reach commercial operations in 2026 and is expected to support a green hydrogen-related facility in development in the Central United States. Additionally, Energy Resources is participating in the development of hydrogen hubs in the Southwest and Southeast. Earlier this month, these hubs were encouraged to file full applications for federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under its $8 billion program to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. In the Southeast, our plan is to support a 140 tons-per-day clean hydrogen facility at our Gulf Clean Energy Center that would be powered by FPL solar projects. In the Southwest, our plan is to build a 120 tons per day electrolysis-based clean hydrogen project in Arizona in partnership with Linde, the world's largest industrial gases company and the largest liquid hydrogen producer in the United States, with whom we recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The clean hydrogen produced by this facility would be used to support decarbonization of the West Coast mobility and industrial end-markets. These are just a few examples of clean hydrogen opportunities our team is actively pursuing. We continue to work with various partners on hydrogen solutions and we are excited by both the number and scale of opportunities in front of us. At our investor conference in June last year, we announced Energy Resources development expectations of roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of new build renewables and storage through 2025. In sizing those expectations, we considered, among other factors, the expiration and phase down of production tax credits and investment tax credits under then-existing tax law. Typically, when tax credits are near the planned expiration dates, we see a spike in demand in the immediate years prior. Then, after tax credits are extended, demand weakens in the short term. Even though tax credits were extended with the IRA, we are continuing to see tremendous demand for new renewables. It is against that backdrop of strong market demand and the continued cost advantages of renewables combined with our unparalleled competitive advantages that today we are extending our development expectations at Energy Resources through 2026. We now believe that we will place into service approximately 32,700 to 41,800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects from 2023 through the end of 2026. If you compare midpoint to midpoint, our new four-year development expectations at Energy Resources are approximately 15% higher than the previous four year development expectations range that we announced at our investor conference last year. To put these numbers into context, just executing at the low-end of our new development expectations through 2026 would more than double the size of our current renewables and storage operating portfolio, which took us more than 20 years to complete. Due to our long-term visibility into clean energy incentives and the significant growth opportunities at both FPL and Energy Resources, I am pleased to announce that we are extending our adjusted earnings per share growth expectations at NextEra Energy by an additional year through 2026. For 2023 and 2024, we expect our adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025 and 2026, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted EPS range. This equates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70 for 2025 and $3.63 to $4 for 2026. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectations ranges in each of 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which had another terrific year of execution, while delivering on its commitments to unitholders. For 2022, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions per unit by approximately 15% year-over-year and delivered more than 20% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. This growth is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2022. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,200 net megawatts of long-term contracted renewables and storage assets from Energy Resources. Our confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' long runway of growth has been further bolstered by the IRA. Against a backdrop that we believe includes at least two decades of clean energy incentives, we expect NextEra Energy Partners' opportunity set for acquiring renewables from both Energy Resources and from third-parties to continue to be robust. NextEra Energy Partners' organic growth opportunities have also expanded significantly, and we are currently evaluating repowering investments for roughly 1.3 gigawatts of wind assets owned by NextEra Energy Partners for 2024 through 2026. Additionally, earlier this month NextEra Energy Partners leveraged its cost of capital advantages to execute early buyouts of tax equity interests on two of its existing asset portfolios for approximately $190 million. These transactions are intended to enable NextEra Energy Partners to take advantage of the IRA's new transferability provisions, which allow for the sale of tax credits to third-parties. With the buyouts and subsequent transfer of tax credits, NextEra Energy Partners can now fully access two cash flow streams for unitholders -- project cash flows and cash flows that result from the transfer of PTCs. Taken together, NextEra Energy Partners expects these early tax equity investor buyouts to deliver an attractive cash available for distribution yield for unitholders. The significant tailwinds provided by the IRA and Energy Resources' future renewables outlook, combined with NextEra Energy Partners' third-party M&A and organic growth opportunities and continued ability to raise low-cost capital, even in a challenging capital markets environment, provide us with long-term growth visibility. As a result, today we are pleased to announce that we are extending our financial expectations for NextEra Energy Partners by another year. We now see 12% to 15% per year growth and per unit distributions as a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We believe that NextEra Energy Partners' distribution per unit growth expectations are best-in-class versus any other company of its kind in the market and that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and financing flexibility offers unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have never been better positioned. We anticipate a tremendous acceleration of growth in renewables and storage deployment across the U.S. due in part to the IRA, particularly in the latter half of the decade. And we believe that our substantial competitive advantages will allow us to continue delivering value to shareholders and unitholders for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Kirk, I'd like to talk about the important organizational changes we are announcing this morning. After 20 years with NextEra Energy, Eric Silagy has notified me of his intention to retire from FPL, where he has led the team for 11 years. Eric has been a passionate advocate for continuous improvement and under his leadership, FPL has been transformed into the Nation's largest and most reliable electric utility. Over the last decade, Eric has led the efforts to modernize FPL's generating fleet, making it one of the cleanest, lowest-cost and most fuel-efficient in the country. His commitment to putting customers first is demonstrated every day by FPL's award winning customer service, bills that are significantly lower than the national average and the best reliability in the country. Last year during hurricanes Ian and Nicole, I saw firsthand Eric's dedication and compassion for our customers as he steered the FPL team to quickly restore power and quickly get the State of Florida back on its feet. Over his 20 years of dedicated service to our company, Eric has also been a tremendous supporter of the communities where we do business. His advocacy across the State has helped to foster Florida's economic growth, strengthen our state university system and grow the next generation of Florida leaders, just to name a few of his many accomplishments. I want to thank Eric for his service and wish him and his family all the best on this next chapter in life. With Eric's departure we are excited to welcome Armando Pimentel back to NextEra Energy as FPL's President and CEO. As you know, Armando previously served as NextEra Energy's and FPL's CFO and the President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources. As a lifelong Floridian, Armando is a proven leader that will be relentlessly focused on serving our customers. He is also a good friend and colleague who I've worked closely with for many years, and I am confident that under Armando's leadership, FPL will continue its long track record of delivering outstanding performance to our customers. Let me now turn the call over to Eric who will make some personal remarks. Yes, thanks, Steve. First of all, on your first question on connection, we're not making a connection. Eric, when I was first chosen to succeed Jim, Eric, and I had a conversation. Eric said, look I will give you a one-year commitment stay at the company. And we would talk about it at the end of the year. Eric satisfied that commitment to me. 2022 obviously was a year with a lot of challenges. The distractions Eric went through in his prepared remarks. But when you think about all the challenges that that he had to overcome with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation and the supply chain and on the media allegations and all those things, I think it took a toll on Eric that that year and gave me his retirement notice. And it's, the way I look at it is it's a little earlier than would've hope Eric, Eric would've wanted to do it. And so we have a very deep bench over at FPL. I'm going to your second question now. A very deep bench at FPL. We have a lot of terrific folks that we could move into Eric's role. We have one individual in particular, Christopher Chapel, he is being promoted to Chief Operating Officer as part of the transition. We're bringing Armando back as well. And Armando has been just a terrific friend to me. I have a lot of respect for Armando. I had the good fortune to work with Armando for roughly 15 years. And I think he will do a great job of bringing Christopher along, who I think in the future will just make an outstanding CEO of FPL. But he, Christopher has been running customer service. He needs to get a little bit more experience on the operations side and on -- and working with the regulatory team. And then on the financial side, getting us ready for the rate case. And I think the combination of Armando working together with Christopher that is a very powerful team, and they will do a tremendous job working together to execute on behalf of FPL. And I think Christopher has a very, very bright future with our company. And all of you will have a chance to get to know him and to meet him in the near future. Some of you have had that chance in the past, and I think that should be a familiar name to some of our investors. Yes. And Steve, I want to just to Eric to say a few words as well. Yes, let me go ahead and take those, Julien. This is John. So first of all on -- with Armando, Armando's committed, he's coming back as our CEO and President of FPL. Armando's committed. So let me just say that. And again, as I said, he is inheriting just a terrific team. I would say easily -- in my own belief, the best team in the industry, and it's a team Eric built and did an outstanding job building, and there's just a lot of strength there. And Armando's has a good fortune of being able to lead that organization. And with Christopher Chapel, as I said too, taking on that that Chief Operating Officer role, I think that's quite a one, two punch that we're going to have over at FPL combined with the existing strength that we already have on the bench there. And the other thing I'll mention is that, Eric, we have the good fortune of Eric staying through the middle of May, which will help ensure a very smooth transition for both Armando moving into to that role. And for Christopher, having a chance to step up, and Eric will do a great job on that transition, and making sure all the right relationships are transitioned as part of that. That's the first piece. The second piece you talked about the internal process and timing. First of all, let me just cover it one more time. I mean, we are substantially complete. On the Florida side, as I said on my comments, we do not believe that FPL would be found liable of a federal campaign finance violation based on our investigation. And second, with regard to the FEC process, let me just say a few words about the FEC process, just so everybody understands exactly what it is. The Federal Election Commission has civil enforcement authority. Anybody in the United States can file a claim with the FEC. And given the political environment that we're in today, I would certainly expect even an uptick in more claims being filed with the FEC, but any citizen can file a complaint. That's where we are right now. A citizen, special interest group filed a complaint. There is no formal legal proceeding or any proceeding with the FEC right now. The FEC will take 12 to 18 months to decide whether or not there is a reason to believe that they should investigate this further. And we will file a motion for dismissal. We think that a claim like this that's based solely on media reports and allegations is not the type of a claim the FEC should take up. If you read the complaint, the complaint details five different scenarios, those, if you add up all the contributions in those scenarios, they don't exceed $1.3 million. And so, when we look at the FEC process as a whole and the FEC complaint as a whole, we do not believe that the federal allegations, taken as a whole, as I said would have a material impact on our business. Yes, let me take that, Julien. The first thing I would say is the demand for renewables is as strong as ever. When I look at the opportunities that the development organization has right now, they are significant. I mentioned in my remarks the term sheet we signed on the 800 megawatt facility in the Central part of the U.S. for a green hydrogen facility that we didn't even count, for example. And we have a lot of interest around hydrogen right now that's going to fuel a lot of renewable opportunities. The C&I market is extremely strong. We're just seeing a lot of demand across the board. And so I think that's why you see with the revised development expectations, 42 gigawatts on the high end, oh my gosh, I think those of you that have been following the company for a long time, 42 Gigs, that's a 15% uptick on the last four year set that we had, I mean, just to put it in perspective, I mean, FPL's total generation fleet is 27 gigawatts, so to 42 gigs over a four-year period, hopefully that provides a little color and context."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy, all of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners; as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power is no longer a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment. And therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\nKirk Crews : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin today's discussion of our third quarter results, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by hurricanes Fiona and Ian over the last month. Hurricane Ian was the fifth strongest hurricane to ever make landfall in the Continental U.S. The powerful and destructive storm hit Southwest Florida as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, devastating storm surges and numerous tornadoes, tragically resulting in the loss of lives and causing more than 2.1 million FPL customers to lose power. In preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled a restoration workforce of approximately 20,000 workers. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with FPL's valuable hardening and smart grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to roughly 2/3 of affected customers after the first full day of restoration following Hurricane Ian's landfall. This represents the fastest restoration rate in our history for a major hurricane. Our dedicated and resourceful workforce was able to restore essentially all FPL customers who are able to safely accept power within eight days. I would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts, for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. Finally, we are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners who came from 30 different states to help support our customers. Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid. While no energy grid is hurricane-proof, the performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening and undergrounding investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. Despite sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, FPL did not lose a single transmission pole or tower during Hurricane Ian. Additionally, initial performance data show that FPL's undergrounding distribution power lines performed 5x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Southwest Florida. On a related note, we were pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission substantially approved our 2023 Storm Protection Plan earlier this month, which we expect will lead to an even stronger and more resilient grid for the benefit of our customers. Finally, we are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained almost no structural damage. Despite 38 of FPL's 50 existing solar sites or approximately 12 million panels being exposed to storm conditions, less than 0.3% of our solar panels were affected, and those impacted were mostly at our older fixed racking sites. Our battery storage sites, including one of the world's largest solar power batteries at our Manatee Solar Energy Center, remained available throughout the storm. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response, have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of Hurricane Ian restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately $220 million will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve, subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission. Under its current settlement agreement, FPL is allowed to collect an equivalent of $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills but can request an increase to the $4 equivalent surcharge given the cost exceeded $800 million. We anticipate discussing the surcharge amount and timing with the Florida Public Service Commission in the coming months. Let me briefly comment on the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, and what it means for our customers, for our company and for our industry. At our investor conference in June, we announced our vision to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy, and we announced our industry-leading goal to deliver Real Zero emissions by no later than 2045. We discussed our strategy to get there and how every part of our strategy is focused on saving customers' money on their energy bills. We also said in June that achieving our goals would require constructive governmental policies and incentives. The IRA gives us those policies and incentives at the federal level. It also gives us visibility into what those policies and incentives will look like for what we believe will be more than two decades. We believe that the IRA will not only help reduce carbon emissions, strengthen energy independent and security, and create jobs in our industry and in our domestic supply chain, but also and most importantly will reduce the cost of energy for everyone. We can already see some of the positive impacts of the IRA on customer bills at FPL. Last month, we filed with the Florida Public Service Commission our estimate that the solar production tax credits in the IRA are expected to save customers nearly $400 million over the course of our current rate agreement. Those savings start with a onetime $25 million refund through the capacity cost recovery clause in January 2023 to reflect the solar PTCs on our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects, subject to a review by the commission, which we expect later this year. Looking forward for our FPL customers, we believe that the IRA makes every solar project, every battery storage project, every renewable gas project and every green hydrogen project more cost-effective. And these solar battery storage, renewable gas and green hydrogen projects are designed to reduce the impact that fuel volatility can have on customer bills. We believe the IRA will help make Florida an even better place to raise a family or build a business as we work toward our goal of delivering 100% carbon emissions free energy affordable and reliably. We believe the IRA will also make clean energy cheaper for our customers at Energy Resources. We have never been more excited about our opportunity to partner with customers to decarbonize the power sector as well as broader parts of the U.S. economy. The IRA provides decades of visibility to low-cost renewables, and that visibility has already encouraged our power sector customers and customers outside the power sector to think big about how they can realize the value of renewables to reduce cost and emissions. As a world leader in renewables with deep energy market expertise, we were having conversations with customers about large-scale opportunities unlike anything we have seen in the past. And while some will take time to develop, we cannot be more excited about the future. Turning now to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 13% year-over-year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-over-year, growing regulatory capital employed by approximately 11% over the prior year period. We have highlighted in the past our smart capital investments in fuel efficiency, combined with our best-in-class O&M performance and productivity initiatives, provide significant benefits to customers and have allowed us to continue to deliver residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a terrific environment for renewables development, originating approximately 2,345 megawatts of new renewables and storage since the last call. With economics as a significant driver, Energy Resources continues to capitalize on strong renewables demand from both power and non-power sector customers, particularly in light of high power prices and high natural gas prices. Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term financial expectations, subject to our usual caveats. For the third quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of nearly $1.1 billion or $0.54 per share, which is an increase of $147 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ended September 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather, we have fully restored our surplus depreciation reserve, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.5 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. As a reminder, our 2021 settlement agreement provided a mechanism whereby a sustained increase in 30-year Treasury Bond yields would trigger an increase in FPL's authorized ROE range. Accordingly, the Florida Public Service Commission approved an increase in FPL's authorized midpoint ROE from 10.6% to 10.8% with an allowed range of 9.8% to 11.8%, which became effective on September 1, 2022. Importantly, FPL will not increase base rates as a result of triggering the increased authorized ROE. For the full year 2022, FPL continues to target an 11.6% ROE but is allowed to earn at the high end of the revised range, which may occur based on, among other things, warmer-than-expected weather. The Florida economy continues to be healthy. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 2.7% remains below the national average and at its lowest level in more than 15 years. Florida's labor force participation rate remains strong. In spite of significant inflationary pressures across many parts of the U.S., customer sentiment and Florida ticked up slightly in the third quarter. However, the August reading of the three-month average of new building permits in Florida declined year-over-year, which is not a surprise given the significant growth we have observed since the pandemic and the recent increase in mortgage rates. We continue to believe that Florida offers a unique value proposition and will continue to show strong population growth over the coming decades. FPL's average number of customers increased by nearly 83,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 3.8% from the prior year comparable period. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2.9% and that Hurricane Ian had a negative impact of approximately 0.4%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter retail sales increased 1.3% on a weather-normalized basis, with a strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $655 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were adjusted earnings per share of more than 19% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.02 per share versus the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewable portfolio. Our existing generation and storage assets decreased results by $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the third quarter, which was the third lowest wind resource quarter on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business contributed $0.06 year-over-year primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses. All other net impacts were roughly flat year-over-year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another terrific quarter of origination, signing approximately 2,345 gigawatts of new renewables and storage projects since our last earnings call. Specifically, we originated approximately 1,215 megawatts of wind, 965 megawatts of solar and 165 megawatts of battery storage projects. Included in these solar additions is approximately 270 megawatts of post-2025 delivery. With these new additions, net of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of projects placed in service and roughly 680 megawatts of projects removed from our backlog, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at roughly 20,000 megawatts and provides strong visibility into the significant growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years. Our development expectations through 2025 are unchanged from what we disclosed at our investor conference in June and reflect a planned renewables and storage build that is, at the midpoint, more than 20% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As previously discussed, we believe Energy Resources is better positioned than anyone in our sector to benefit from the provisions of the IRA, particularly after 2025 when incentives were previously expected to expire or step down. With what we believe is over two decades of visibility for wind, solar and storage credits, the long-term growth opportunity set is expansive and exciting. Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to capitalize on battery storage colocation opportunities with wind and now has repowering opportunities across this existing renewables footprint. New markets and new investment opportunities are being created for renewables and renewable fuels that require wind and solar as their source.  Transmission will be needed to support this significant renewables buildout. And all these opportunities support our vision of leading decarbonization of the U.S. economy. A key component of our vision is helping commercial and industrial customers meet their sustainability goals by providing them with comprehensive clean energy solutions, including providing renewable fuel alternatives such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas. To that end, today, we are excited to announce we reached an agreement to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas to electric facilities, which will become a core part of our renewable fuels and potentially hydrogen strategies. This transaction represents an attractive opportunity for Energy Resources to expand its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and grow its in-house capabilities in this rapidly expanding market. Energy Resources intends to purchase the portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, subject to closing adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $37 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in early 2023. In the coming years, we expect to invest roughly $400 million net of the investment tax credit benefit of additional capital into the portfolio of projects, primarily to enable production of renewable natural gas. In our base case, we expect that the acquired portfolio delivered more than $220 million of adjusted EBITDA at Energy Resources by 2025, which is included in our financial expectations. Moreover, the acquisition is expected to deliver double-digit returns. We are particularly excited about additional upside opportunities the portfolio may enable that are not included in our base case and look forward to potentially deploying additional capital and new ventures that may qualify for new federal incentives. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was roughly $1.7 billion or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.683 billion and $0.85 per share, respectively. Adjusted results for the Corporate and Other segment decreased by $0.03 year-over-year. A hallmark of our business is our financial discipline and forward planning as we grow the business, including the consideration of a range of scenarios to manage interest rate risk. In recent years, we've proactively engaged in liability management initiatives, which we expect to yield significant interest cost savings through 2025. Additionally, we have $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. With the swaps in place, we're in good shape to manage 2023 and 2024 maturities and new debt issuances despite the current interest rate environment. Finally, the recent increase in interest rates is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges for 2022 through 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. In addition, for 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered strong financial performance for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 13% and 17%, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter. Last week, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 78.75 cents per common unit or $3.15 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by approximately 320% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners continued to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of an approximately 67% interest in a 230-megawatt 4-hour battery storage facility in California from Energy Resources. This acquisition further diversifies NextEra Energy Partners portfolio into battery storage. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners issued approximately $145 million in new equity through its at-the-market program and used these proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund this acquisition. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2023 run rate expectations, which are built upon NextEra Energy Partners' strong existing portfolio and cash flow generation potential and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. At the midpoints, NextEra Energy Partners' new year-end 2023 run rate expectation ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 12%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2022 run rate expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $377 million, and cash available for distribution was $185 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $18 million year-over-year driven primarily by unfavorable renewable resource. Wind resource for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 95% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter cash available for distribution benefited from higher year-over-year PAYGO payments from both new and existing projects after a relatively strong wind resource period in the first half of this year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slides. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. At year-end 2023, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $770 million to $860 million. These expectations highlight our continued confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' ability to deliver on its long-term distribution per common unit growth expectations. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to manage financing costs in the current interest rate environment. Approximately 98% of NextEra Energy Partners' long-term debt, including current maturities, is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rate as it is either fixed rate debt or financially hedged. Moreover, NextEra Energy Partners has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for growth or maturities. NextEra Energy Partners also has no significant debt maturities in '23, and debt maturities over the next five years are manageable in -- with the forward starting swaps. Finally, I'd like to close with a few words about how we expect the IRA may benefit NextEra Energy Partners and its LP unitholders. In response to the extension and expansion of clean energy tax credits, we anticipate an acceleration of renewables and storage deployment in the U.S. over the next few decades. In turn, we expect that NextEra Energy Partners will continue to have ample opportunities to acquire assets from both Energy Resources and from third parties. Additionally, we believe that the long-term organic growth potential for NextEra Energy Partners has increased, with potential new opportunities to repower its roughly 8 gigawatt existing wind and solar assets and to pair battery storage with this nearly 7 gigawatt existing wind portfolio. Considering the potential impacts of the IRA, our expectation regarding the overall tax position for NextEra Energy Partners remains largely unchanged, including that it is not expected to pay any meaningful taxes for at least the next 15 years. Combined with its current yield and the expectation of 12% to 15% annual distributions per unit growth through at least 2025, NextEra Energy Partners has the potential to deliver a total after-tax return of approximately 20% annually through this time frame. With the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and all of the market tailwinds provided by the IR, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best execution track records in the industry, and we are extremely excited about the long-term growth prospects for both businesses and the value we can continue to create for both customers and shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman : So just first on the -- last quarter, you had mentioned the 2 gigawatts of potential backlog that could be at risk due to circumvention and the like. And I don't see any updated footnotes on that. So I don't know if that's resolved or -- could you give us an update on those 2 gigawatts?\nRebecca Kujawa : Steve, it's Rebecca. And I'd be happy to start with that answer. First, let me start with the most important part, which is everything that we're seeing at this point in terms of origination at Energy Resources is just terrific. We're seeing strong demand across all the technologies, strong demand across the different customer groups and strong demand across the country. And I feel terrific about meeting the long-term expectations that we've laid out, including reiterating today of the 27.7 to 36.9 gigawatts of new projects put into service between '22 and '25. And I think the origination for this quarter of the over 2,300 megawatts is a great sign to that, and the momentum remains very strong. As you know and appreciate being involved in the development process, there's always some things that can go wrong as you move forward with developing a project where it could be unforeseen permitting or interconnection issues or something else that gets in the way. And so occasionally, we do remove projects from backlog like we did today. We didn't include the reference to the 2 gigawatts mostly because it's going to be harder and harder as time goes by to identify what's related to issues from circumvention and supply chain versus normal development issues. So I think I'd lean more on the side of giving you context for what's going on against our expectations, what's the current momentum. And both of those are just terrific.\nSteven Fleishman : Okay. That's good. And I guess just specific to supply chain, any updated things that you're seeing related to UFLPA impacts?\nRebecca Kujawa : Yes, Steve. It continues to be an opportunity for our team to work through challenges that we're experiencing along with the rest of the industry. We've continued to work with the various agencies, most importantly, Customs and Border Control, with our suppliers to bring clarity to these implementing regulations. And while we continue to see progress, it also continues to be slower than we would like. Everything that we've laid out today in terms of our expectations reflect our latest views on when panels will be delivered to us, and we'll be able to bring projects into service for our customers. One of the biggest things that our team has been working on over the last year is how do we mitigate the risks related to these broader geopolitical issues, whether you focus specifically on a circumvention issue or UFLPA or whatever else it might entail. And our suppliers have made tremendous progress on de-risking that. And we've gotten a lot of increased confidence longer term. It will be able to mitigate the issues even if we see some disruption in the short term.\nSteven Fleishman : Okay. Great. One last question, just, I guess, on the internal investigation related to the Florida political noise. Is there any update on timing or -- and/or outcome of that?\nJohn Ketchum: Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me just start from beginning. As you know, media articles have been published that allege, among other things, campaign finance violations by FPL, and we have a core who\u2019s been conducting a very thorough review of those allegations with the national law firm, Paul, Weiss. Late yesterday afternoon, a complaint was filed by a non-profit corporation with the Federal Election Commission that appears to center around some of the same allegations as those that have appeared in a lot of the media articles. So all those allegations that have been made are within the scope of our review. We have a core who's been taking the matter very seriously, and we will continue to do so as we work towards completing our thorough review of these matters as quickly as possible. And that's really the only update I have at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Listen, I just want to jump at the heart of the matter here. How do you think about IRA in terms of increasing your EPS through the 2025 forecast? Or is this about extending the duration of the existing growth and/or both, right? The pivot to the solar PTC from ITC for a host of products already in flight should be immediately accretive, you would think. But clearly, there could be some offsets as well. And then related, the added opportunities in the repowering and storage colocation as you guys quantify just now, in theory, should also afford an accelerated opportunity. But I just want to come back on how you guys want to tackle that from an earnings recognition perspective.\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. Let me go ahead and take that, Julien. This is John. As you said, look, IRA provides a tremendous opportunity set for us across the board. Obviously, we've had some contracts that were already in place that assumed ITC on solar and obviously benefit from the production tax credit. So there's benefits certainly in the existing portfolio. I think we're also going to see some improvement going forward. As I said, I think recently at a conference in our 70-30 in the way things are treated on the unregulated business mix standpoint because, remember, those new PTCs that we get actually helped to buy down the contribution from the unregulated side of the business. So that's a big benefit for us as well going forward. We have transferability options now built into IRA that should help the cash flow from operations as well as we go -- as we think about the future of the business. I mean, obviously, it creates a lot of immediately in the money opportunities for us going forward, both on wind, on solar and on battery storage. Nobody has the existing footprint that we have.  And so having not only a 20-gigawatt backlog, but you combine that with 25 gigawatts of operating renewables, and you just think about the potential opportunity of 45 gigawatts around repowerings and with regard to colocated storage because, as we all know, under the old regime, the only way you could really introduce storage into the puzzle was by combining it with solar. Nobody has the wind footprint that we do. And so now we have the opportunity to put -- colocate storage in all of our wind sites, not only that we own today, but that we might build going forward. The same goes with solar. And then obviously, there's an opportunity now to go ahead and build storage stand-alone. And so that is terrific, not only for Energy Resources, but obviously provides a great opportunity set for NEP going forward as well. In terms of timing, which I think was the other part of your question, I think we've been very open that we plan to provide a further update on the next call in January on the Q4 call.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And just to get ahead of that fourth quarter a little bit, you would have a more holistic update on just the extent that the repowering opportunities and colocated opportunities through, call it, the '25 period by fourth quarter. Again, I get that it takes some time to actually execute to decide what...\nJohn Ketchum : Yes, Julien, we'll do the best we can. Remember, too, that there are some regulations we're working on with the Treasury Department as well. So some of that update around repower and colocated storage might be tied to finalization of those, but we'll certainly try to give a view.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza : Just a real quick follow-up on Julien's question. Just -- maybe just fine-tuning it a little bit, as we're kind of looking at just the near-term earnings guidance that you guys have out there, how do we sort of think about the IRA impact as we're thinking about the existing PPAs, right, which predominantly don't have any reopeners, and then you couple that with sort of some of the counteracting items like higher interest rate environment, do these two sort of items, are they offsetting? Are they accretive? I guess how do we think about those two items in the context of what you guys have just reiterated this morning?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. I think, Shahriar, you've got to balance all those things together. First of all, it's really project by project. I mean some projects benefit more than others, and that really depends on which projects have been impacted by some of the supply chain issues that we have had. That's really the first piece. From an interest rate standpoint, though, I think for -- Kirk dealt with that. I mean, obviously, the current interest rate move is taken into account in our expectations. And I think we've been very prudent and careful about managing that interest rate exposure. I mean we have $15 billion of interest rate swap protection in the book. So I'd really think about it more of -- more as a -- an ITC to PTC versus supply chain trade-offs. Some projects benefit more than others. So you kind of have to go down the list and look at it on a deal-by-deal basis.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on -- FPL, obviously, you had a 10-year site plan adjusted for inclusion of tax legislation. I think IRA came out even better than prior proposals. So does that prompt an update for a preferred solution at FP&L, maybe going from 10 to 20 gigs? What would be the cadence for an update or to pivot resource strategy there?\nEric Silagy: So we'll be filing -- updating our 10-year site plan as we do every year. We're in the process now of updating that. That gets filed on April 1. Obviously, as I talked before, there's opportunities going forward. We're always looking at ways to make it even more economic to be able to deploy the assets, including the solar that we're currently doing. But we're currently five years ahead of plan on our 10,000 megawatts of solar to be installed, and that's on file with the commission, and then we'll update our 10-year site plan and file that on April 1.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific. And then just one last quick one. Just curious on the move in the RNG side. Your '25 EBITDA guidance for the acquisition is based on existing operating assets or does that include a backlog of RNG development that would require additional funding?\nRebecca Kujawa : Thanks. I appreciate the question. We're really excited about the acquisition. It is about just over 30 projects that do landfill, gas, electricity or renewable natural gas today. And that number in '25 reflects our base case. And in our base case, we are converting a number of those facilities from landfill gas to electricity to renewable natural gas. So it does include the investment that we referenced in the prepared remarks of about $400 million in order to convert them to produce renewable natural gas. One of the reasons why we're really excited about the transaction, though, is there's a lot of optionality in it, and some of which was afforded in the Inflation Reduction Act. One is these projects now qualify for an investment tax credit, which obviously enhances the economics of the conversions. There's also the opportunity to support the further decarbonization or the improving of carbon intensity for blue hydrogen, which really opens up a whole new market for renewable natural gas that we think is going to be very attractive to blue hydrogen producers to enable the full value of the PTC where they otherwise wouldn't have been entitled to the full value of the PTC. And in doing that, we think that creates a real long-term contracted market because a blue hydrogen producer will be very motivated to lock in the value that the renewable natural gas lending will bring to their economics. There's also the opportunity, if it isn't a blue hydrogen contribution, actually to keep some of these assets producing electricity and utilizing what we expect are new regulations coming out of the EPA to enable a pathway for the RINs, the predominant renewable fuel credit that renewable natural gas benefits from today, that there'll be a pathway enabled for electric vehicles. So that might enable us to not invest that $400 million in some or all of those assets to convert them to renewable natural gas. So I think the bottom line is we are very excited about it. We think this is a great platform from which to grow our renewable fuel business, our renewable energy solutions in order to help our customers across the broad set of sectors, both in the power sector and beyond to enable their full decarbonization. \nOperator: Our next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: Maybe continuing on that, just wondering more broadly your thoughts on the M&A landscape, are there priorities or attractive opportunities out there in the market right now that you might be considering?\nJohn Ketchum : I will go ahead and take that. David, this is John. We have so many terrific organic opportunities, growth opportunities in front of us. M&A is not an area of focus. \nDavid Arcaro: And then, maybe on the renewable side of things, wondering if you could comment on the ICC and FEMA proposal to rate the structural risk ranking of solar and wind? What could that do for your projects, your pipeline and the costs for developing renewables?\nJohn Ketchum: I will go ahead and take as well. So FEMA did come forward with some recent proposals. Those have not been put to a final vote yet. I think the best example as to why none of those changes are required is what we just saw with Hurricane Ian. And so when you -- Kirk had some of those remarks in the script, but I think it's worth noting, and obviously, we put this information back in front of FEMA that none of this is necessary. Because if you evaluate what happened in Hurricane Ian, which was the fifth worst most catastrophic storm to ever hit the Continental United States, it passed over 38 to 50 of our solar sites with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour. We had essentially no impact to our solar generating facilities. About 0.3% of the panels were impacted. And you got to remember, that slight number of impacts that even occurred were on the older sites that have the fixed tracker technology. Now if the new tracker technology, we can move it east to west, we can pivot it to the 35 degrees. The wind cuts right through it. We saw essentially no damage at those sites. The solar held up extremely well. And in some cases, I think probably better than even a gas plant, which are really rated up to only 100 miles an hour. So really happy with the way it all performed. We think the FEMA changes are completely unnecessary, and we are working through that with them with terrific evidence from how our own fleet just performed a couple of weeks ago as a no better case in point.\nEric Silagy : So this is Eric Silagy. I guess I'll just add a little bit. So when John talks about the panels that were -- the 0.3% of panels that were affected, many of those panels weren't even damage at the point we simply put them back on and reuse them. So to put it in perspective, panels that actually had to be replaced out of 12 million panels is 0.03% or 3,000 panels out of 12 million. And so to John's point, it is immaterial. And we were up and running the next morning with output at our plants.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Congrats on a good quarter. One for Eric. Talk about $8.5 billion of capital deployment this year at FP&L. How should we think about what that level looks like, call it, in 2023 and 2024? And maybe what are the puts and takes that could move it in either direction for those years?\nEric Silagy : Michael, it's Eric. So look, we have a robust capital plan that continues. We've talked about it before from a standpoint of our storm hardening that program. Obviously, you could see the impacts with Ian and how beautifully it really made a difference. We're going to continue with our storm hardening program, our undergrounding program, our solar build-out. We have great visibility into our capital deployed right through the rate case settlement period and what we have filed through our 10-year site plan.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. So I'm just trying to think about this just, is capital spend above or below 2022 levels for the next couple of years?\nEric Silagy : It's basically where it is at the '22 levels. It varies a little bit but is exactly what we put forward for the plan here for the last two years that we've had going forward.\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. Michael, I would just add, there's no real deviation from what we shared at the investor conference. So it's in line with the plans that we laid out in terms of roughly $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion a year over the settlement terms.\nMichael Lapides: Yes. The only reason I ask -- and thank you for that -- is given the fact you've got the full surplus amortization back on board right now, you could actually invest more to improve reliability, and obviously, green the system even more without necessarily having to, A, hurt earnings; and B, increase customer rates for the next couple of years.\nEric Silagy : Yes. But Michael, again, we're right now sticking with our plan. We've got a good visibility. A lot of this, remember, it's a lot of execution. And so we have a -- we've been managing the supply chain. We've been managing all the issues that have been a challenge for folks across the country and being able to hit that CapEx plan is right now what we see is the best path forward to be able to maintain what the commission expects and, financially, what we expect.\nMichael Lapides : Got it. And then one for Rebecca. Just curious, what are you seeing in terms of just -- just given what's happening inflation-wise around the world, especially commodity and labor, what the cost to install new wind and solar has -- kind of how much that has changed before we kind of bake in the higher tax credit levels?\nRebecca Kujawa : Yes. Michael, I think we obviously had a number of comments around this at the investor conference. We certainly have seen increases in costs, both in the -- or the -- actually equipment prices as well as balance the system and the labor to build the projects. I don't know that it's materially changed from what we shared with you a couple of months ago. I think we were at the peak in a lot of commodity prices and even some of the key ones that ultimately affect the inherent costs of our building a project have come down since then. As we think about it long term, we obviously have views on what it's going to look like going forward and that we build those expectations into our Power Purchase Agreement prices with our customers. I think one of the key things to keep in mind, particularly as you think about the overall demand for renewables and other clean energy solutions long term, is that they have such a competitive advantage against the alternatives. So even where we've seen increases in costs, even in some areas, maybe at parity with what we've seen in terms of the strict value that the IRA incentives may have brought in terms of the difference versus prior incentives, what we've seen is that the alternatives have increased even more. And that goes from new build as well as the overall market prices. So from our customer standpoint, which is what -- who we're focused on the most, they are as compelling as they've ever been to incorporate into their solutions, whether that be a power customer to bring down electricity prices for their customers, which is clearly very top of mind for our customers today, but also our non-power sector customers who are finding ways to not only provide a lower carbon intensity product to their customers, but they want to do it at lower cost. And we've got great solutions for them.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : Just wanted to hit on RNG real quick and maybe round out the conversation a little bit more, big acquisition here, but how do you think about the total addressable market here? And is the focus really just on landfills in certain locations or other parts of RNG could be interesting as well? And then lastly, I guess, further expansion, it seems like you have quite a platform to work off here, but future RNG would be just organic? Or could there be more purchases as well?\nRebecca Kujawa : And thanks for the question. We're very excited about the potential for RNG, in particular, as part of the broad set of solutions we want to offer our customers. So I would say this is just a large step forward in something we've already been working on with smaller investments and some other co-investments with other folks. And we're excited about not only adding these portfolio of projects and the value that this creates for our shareholders, but also using it as a platform for future growth.  As part of this acquisition, building a services company along with it. That's part of what the existing portfolio provides, and we're excited about incorporating those capabilities into our team. And we are excited about both landfill gas and alternative forms of renewable natural gas, including [dairy] long term. So we'll do it both through organic as well as through acquisitions. So -- and all of the above. We're excited about the size of the acquisition space. But before I get too excited, we also need to keep in mind that as the $85 billion to $95 billion of capital we want to invest over the period we laid out at the investor conference, this is approximately $1 billion and change. So a great addition to our portfolio, but still in context, a measured step in the overall portfolio.\nJeremy Tonet : Got it. Very helpful. And just rounding out the conversation on hydrogen, I think you touched on it a bit, but any other updated thoughts you want to share with us post-IRA here?\nRebecca Kujawa : I'm thrilled with the prospects of hydrogen going forward and not just literally hydrogen itself, but the renewable fuels that, that creates is potential solutions for our customers, whether that's synthetic natural gas as a potential solutions for customers who are looking for 7/24 fully decarbonized power, but also through synthetic jet fuels, synthetic ammonia products, other things that will help bring out of people's supply chain, manufacturing processes, et cetera, their carbon-intensive fuels that they use today. Some of those are not going to be economic literally today, but there's a clear pathway to them being economic in a couple of years, but some of them with the benefit of the IRA incentives are economic today. And at the heart of them, what the opportunity is for us is to deploy a substantial amount of renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, battery storage, the core things that we have been very successful doing for years now, if not decades, and we're continuing to invest heavily to maintain those competitive advantages going forward.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, which also concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin today's discussion of our third quarter results, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by hurricanes Fiona and Ian over the last month. Hurricane Ian was the fifth strongest hurricane to ever make landfall in the Continental U.S. The powerful and destructive storm hit Southwest Florida as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, devastating storm surges and numerous tornadoes, tragically resulting in the loss of lives and causing more than 2.1 million FPL customers to lose power. In preparation for the hurricane, FPL assembled a restoration workforce of approximately 20,000 workers. This preparation and coordinated response, combined with FPL's valuable hardening and smart grid investments, enabled the company to restore service to roughly 2/3 of affected customers after the first full day of restoration following Hurricane Ian's landfall. This represents the fastest restoration rate in our history for a major hurricane. Our dedicated and resourceful workforce was able to restore essentially all FPL customers who are able to safely accept power within eight days. I would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts, for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. Finally, we are deeply grateful for the assistance provided by our industry partners who came from 30 different states to help support our customers. Mutual aid in times of disaster is one of the hallmarks of our industry, and this storm was no exception. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient grid. While no energy grid is hurricane-proof, the performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening and undergrounding investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. Despite sustained winds of approximately 150 miles per hour, FPL did not lose a single transmission pole or tower during Hurricane Ian. Additionally, initial performance data show that FPL's undergrounding distribution power lines performed 5x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Southwest Florida. On a related note, we were pleased that the Florida Public Service Commission substantially approved our 2023 Storm Protection Plan earlier this month, which we expect will lead to an even stronger and more resilient grid for the benefit of our customers. Finally, we are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained almost no structural damage. Despite 38 of FPL's 50 existing solar sites or approximately 12 million panels being exposed to storm conditions, less than 0.3% of our solar panels were affected, and those impacted were mostly at our older fixed racking sites. Our battery storage sites, including one of the world's largest solar power batteries at our Manatee Solar Energy Center, remained available throughout the storm. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response, have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of Hurricane Ian restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately $220 million will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve, subject to a review and prudence determination of our final storm cost by the Florida Public Service Commission. Under its current settlement agreement, FPL is allowed to collect an equivalent of $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hours of usage on residential bills but can request an increase to the $4 equivalent surcharge given the cost exceeded $800 million. We anticipate discussing the surcharge amount and timing with the Florida Public Service Commission in the coming months. Let me briefly comment on the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, and what it means for our customers, for our company and for our industry. At our investor conference in June, we announced our vision to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy, and we announced our industry-leading goal to deliver Real Zero emissions by no later than 2045. We discussed our strategy to get there and how every part of our strategy is focused on saving customers' money on their energy bills. We also said in June that achieving our goals would require constructive governmental policies and incentives. The IRA gives us those policies and incentives at the federal level. It also gives us visibility into what those policies and incentives will look like for what we believe will be more than two decades. We believe that the IRA will not only help reduce carbon emissions, strengthen energy independent and security, and create jobs in our industry and in our domestic supply chain, but also and most importantly will reduce the cost of energy for everyone. We can already see some of the positive impacts of the IRA on customer bills at FPL. Last month, we filed with the Florida Public Service Commission our estimate that the solar production tax credits in the IRA are expected to save customers nearly $400 million over the course of our current rate agreement. Those savings start with a onetime $25 million refund through the capacity cost recovery clause in January 2023 to reflect the solar PTCs on our completed 2022 rate-based solar projects, subject to a review by the commission, which we expect later this year. Looking forward for our FPL customers, we believe that the IRA makes every solar project, every battery storage project, every renewable gas project and every green hydrogen project more cost-effective. And these solar battery storage, renewable gas and green hydrogen projects are designed to reduce the impact that fuel volatility can have on customer bills. We believe the IRA will help make Florida an even better place to raise a family or build a business as we work toward our goal of delivering 100% carbon emissions free energy affordable and reliably. We believe the IRA will also make clean energy cheaper for our customers at Energy Resources. We have never been more excited about our opportunity to partner with customers to decarbonize the power sector as well as broader parts of the U.S. economy. The IRA provides decades of visibility to low-cost renewables, and that visibility has already encouraged our power sector customers and customers outside the power sector to think big about how they can realize the value of renewables to reduce cost and emissions. As a world leader in renewables with deep energy market expertise, we were having conversations with customers about large-scale opportunities unlike anything we have seen in the past. And while some will take time to develop, we cannot be more excited about the future. Turning now to our financial performance. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 13% year-over-year. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.07 year-over-year, growing regulatory capital employed by approximately 11% over the prior year period. We have highlighted in the past our smart capital investments in fuel efficiency, combined with our best-in-class O&M performance and productivity initiatives, provide significant benefits to customers and have allowed us to continue to deliver residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a terrific environment for renewables development, originating approximately 2,345 megawatts of new renewables and storage since the last call. With economics as a significant driver, Energy Resources continues to capitalize on strong renewables demand from both power and non-power sector customers, particularly in light of high power prices and high natural gas prices. Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term financial expectations, subject to our usual caveats. For the third quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of nearly $1.1 billion or $0.54 per share, which is an increase of $147 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's earnings per share growth of approximately 15%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the third quarter, and we continue to expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ended September 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather, we have fully restored our surplus depreciation reserve, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.5 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. As a reminder, our 2021 settlement agreement provided a mechanism whereby a sustained increase in 30-year Treasury Bond yields would trigger an increase in FPL's authorized ROE range. Accordingly, the Florida Public Service Commission approved an increase in FPL's authorized midpoint ROE from 10.6% to 10.8% with an allowed range of 9.8% to 11.8%, which became effective on September 1, 2022. Importantly, FPL will not increase base rates as a result of triggering the increased authorized ROE. For the full year 2022, FPL continues to target an 11.6% ROE but is allowed to earn at the high end of the revised range, which may occur based on, among other things, warmer-than-expected weather. The Florida economy continues to be healthy. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 2.7% remains below the national average and at its lowest level in more than 15 years. Florida's labor force participation rate remains strong. In spite of significant inflationary pressures across many parts of the U.S., customer sentiment and Florida ticked up slightly in the third quarter. However, the August reading of the three-month average of new building permits in Florida declined year-over-year, which is not a surprise given the significant growth we have observed since the pandemic and the recent increase in mortgage rates. We continue to believe that Florida offers a unique value proposition and will continue to show strong population growth over the coming decades. FPL's average number of customers increased by nearly 83,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued strong underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 3.8% from the prior year comparable period. For the third quarter, we estimate that warmer weather had a positive year-over-year impact on usage per customer of approximately 2.9% and that Hurricane Ian had a negative impact of approximately 0.4%. After taking these factors into account, third quarter retail sales increased 1.3% on a weather-normalized basis, with a strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported third quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $655 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were adjusted earnings per share of more than 19% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.02 per share versus the prior year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewable portfolio. Our existing generation and storage assets decreased results by $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the third quarter, which was the third lowest wind resource quarter on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business contributed $0.06 year-over-year primarily due to higher margins in our customer-facing businesses. All other net impacts were roughly flat year-over-year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another terrific quarter of origination, signing approximately 2,345 gigawatts of new renewables and storage projects since our last earnings call. Specifically, we originated approximately 1,215 megawatts of wind, 965 megawatts of solar and 165 megawatts of battery storage projects. Included in these solar additions is approximately 270 megawatts of post-2025 delivery. With these new additions, net of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of projects placed in service and roughly 680 megawatts of projects removed from our backlog, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at roughly 20,000 megawatts and provides strong visibility into the significant growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years. Our development expectations through 2025 are unchanged from what we disclosed at our investor conference in June and reflect a planned renewables and storage build that is, at the midpoint, more than 20% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. As previously discussed, we believe Energy Resources is better positioned than anyone in our sector to benefit from the provisions of the IRA, particularly after 2025 when incentives were previously expected to expire or step down. With what we believe is over two decades of visibility for wind, solar and storage credits, the long-term growth opportunity set is expansive and exciting. Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to capitalize on battery storage colocation opportunities with wind and now has repowering opportunities across this existing renewables footprint. New markets and new investment opportunities are being created for renewables and renewable fuels that require wind and solar as their source.  Transmission will be needed to support this significant renewables buildout. And all these opportunities support our vision of leading decarbonization of the U.S. economy. A key component of our vision is helping commercial and industrial customers meet their sustainability goals by providing them with comprehensive clean energy solutions, including providing renewable fuel alternatives such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas. To that end, today, we are excited to announce we reached an agreement to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas to electric facilities, which will become a core part of our renewable fuels and potentially hydrogen strategies. This transaction represents an attractive opportunity for Energy Resources to expand its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and grow its in-house capabilities in this rapidly expanding market. Energy Resources intends to purchase the portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion, subject to closing adjustments, plus the assumption of approximately $37 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in early 2023. In the coming years, we expect to invest roughly $400 million net of the investment tax credit benefit of additional capital into the portfolio of projects, primarily to enable production of renewable natural gas. In our base case, we expect that the acquired portfolio delivered more than $220 million of adjusted EBITDA at Energy Resources by 2025, which is included in our financial expectations. Moreover, the acquisition is expected to deliver double-digit returns. We are particularly excited about additional upside opportunities the portfolio may enable that are not included in our base case and look forward to potentially deploying additional capital and new ventures that may qualify for new federal incentives. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was roughly $1.7 billion or $0.86 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.683 billion and $0.85 per share, respectively. Adjusted results for the Corporate and Other segment decreased by $0.03 year-over-year. A hallmark of our business is our financial discipline and forward planning as we grow the business, including the consideration of a range of scenarios to manage interest rate risk. In recent years, we've proactively engaged in liability management initiatives, which we expect to yield significant interest cost savings through 2025. Additionally, we have $15 billion of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuances. With the swaps in place, we're in good shape to manage 2023 and 2024 maturities and new debt issuances despite the current interest rate environment. Finally, the recent increase in interest rates is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges for 2022 through 2025, while at the same time, maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. In addition, for 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered strong financial performance for the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 13% and 17%, respectively, against the prior year comparable quarter. Last week, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 78.75 cents per common unit or $3.15 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by approximately 320% since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners continued to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of an approximately 67% interest in a 230-megawatt 4-hour battery storage facility in California from Energy Resources. This acquisition further diversifies NextEra Energy Partners portfolio into battery storage. During the quarter, NextEra Energy Partners issued approximately $145 million in new equity through its at-the-market program and used these proceeds, along with cash on hand, to fund this acquisition. Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2023 run rate expectations, which are built upon NextEra Energy Partners' strong existing portfolio and cash flow generation potential and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. At the midpoints, NextEra Energy Partners' new year-end 2023 run rate expectation ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 12%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2022 run rate expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $377 million, and cash available for distribution was $185 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $18 million year-over-year driven primarily by unfavorable renewable resource. Wind resource for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 95% of the long-term average versus 101% in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter cash available for distribution benefited from higher year-over-year PAYGO payments from both new and existing projects after a relatively strong wind resource period in the first half of this year. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slides. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. At year-end 2023, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $770 million to $860 million. These expectations highlight our continued confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' ability to deliver on its long-term distribution per common unit growth expectations. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to manage financing costs in the current interest rate environment. Approximately 98% of NextEra Energy Partners' long-term debt, including current maturities, is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rate as it is either fixed rate debt or financially hedged. Moreover, NextEra Energy Partners has $6 billion of forward starting interest rate swaps, which will help mitigate the impact of higher interest rates on future debt issuances, whether for growth or maturities. NextEra Energy Partners also has no significant debt maturities in '23, and debt maturities over the next five years are manageable in -- with the forward starting swaps. Finally, I'd like to close with a few words about how we expect the IRA may benefit NextEra Energy Partners and its LP unitholders. In response to the extension and expansion of clean energy tax credits, we anticipate an acceleration of renewables and storage deployment in the U.S. over the next few decades. In turn, we expect that NextEra Energy Partners will continue to have ample opportunities to acquire assets from both Energy Resources and from third parties. Additionally, we believe that the long-term organic growth potential for NextEra Energy Partners has increased, with potential new opportunities to repower its roughly 8 gigawatt existing wind and solar assets and to pair battery storage with this nearly 7 gigawatt existing wind portfolio. Considering the potential impacts of the IRA, our expectation regarding the overall tax position for NextEra Energy Partners remains largely unchanged, including that it is not expected to pay any meaningful taxes for at least the next 15 years. Combined with its current yield and the expectation of 12% to 15% annual distributions per unit growth through at least 2025, NextEra Energy Partners has the potential to deliver a total after-tax return of approximately 20% annually through this time frame. With the ongoing strength of the renewables development environment and all of the market tailwinds provided by the IR, we believe that NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue delivering on its unitholder value proposition. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best execution track records in the industry, and we are extremely excited about the long-term growth prospects for both businesses and the value we can continue to create for both customers and shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions."

            "name": "Eric Silagy",
            "content": "So we'll be filing -- updating our 10-year site plan as we do every year. We're in the process now of updating that. That gets filed on April 1. Obviously, as I talked before, there's opportunities going forward. We're always looking at ways to make it even more economic to be able to deploy the assets, including the solar that we're currently doing. But we're currently five years ahead of plan on our 10,000 megawatts of solar to be installed, and that's on file with the commission, and then we'll update our 10-year site plan and file that on April 1. So this is Eric Silagy. I guess I'll just add a little bit. So when John talks about the panels that were -- the 0.3% of panels that were affected, many of those panels weren't even damage at the point we simply put them back on and reuse them. So to put it in perspective, panels that actually had to be replaced out of 12 million panels is 0.03% or 3,000 panels out of 12 million. And so to John's point, it is immaterial. And we were up and running the next morning with output at our plants. Michael, it's Eric. So look, we have a robust capital plan that continues. We've talked about it before from a standpoint of our storm hardening that program. Obviously, you could see the impacts with Ian and how beautifully it really made a difference. We're going to continue with our storm hardening program, our undergrounding program, our solar build-out. We have great visibility into our capital deployed right through the rate case settlement period and what we have filed through our 10-year site plan. It's basically where it is at the '22 levels. It varies a little bit but is exactly what we put forward for the plan here for the last two years that we've had going forward. Yes. But Michael, again, we're right now sticking with our plan. We've got a good visibility. A lot of this, remember, it's a lot of execution. And so we have a -- we've been managing the supply chain. We've been managing all the issues that have been a challenge for folks across the country and being able to hit that CapEx plan is right now what we see is the best path forward to be able to maintain what the commission expects and, financially, what we expect."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me just start from beginning. As you know, media articles have been published that allege, among other things, campaign finance violations by FPL, and we have a core who's been conducting a very thorough review of those allegations with the national law firm, Paul, Weiss. Late yesterday afternoon, a complaint was filed by a non-profit corporation with the Federal Election Commission that appears to center around some of the same allegations as those that have appeared in a lot of the media articles. So all those allegations that have been made are within the scope of our review. We have a core who's been taking the matter very seriously, and we will continue to do so as we work towards completing our thorough review of these matters as quickly as possible. And that's really the only update I have at this point. Yes. Let me go ahead and take that, Julien. This is John. As you said, look, IRA provides a tremendous opportunity set for us across the board. Obviously, we've had some contracts that were already in place that assumed ITC on solar and obviously benefit from the production tax credit. So there's benefits certainly in the existing portfolio. I think we're also going to see some improvement going forward. As I said, I think recently at a conference in our 70-30 in the way things are treated on the unregulated business mix standpoint because, remember, those new PTCs that we get actually helped to buy down the contribution from the unregulated side of the business. So that's a big benefit for us as well going forward. We have transferability options now built into IRA that should help the cash flow from operations as well as we go -- as we think about the future of the business. I mean, obviously, it creates a lot of immediately in the money opportunities for us going forward, both on wind, on solar and on battery storage. Nobody has the existing footprint that we have.  And so having not only a 20-gigawatt backlog, but you combine that with 25 gigawatts of operating renewables, and you just think about the potential opportunity of 45 gigawatts around repowerings and with regard to colocated storage because, as we all know, under the old regime, the only way you could really introduce storage into the puzzle was by combining it with solar. Nobody has the wind footprint that we do. And so now we have the opportunity to put -- colocate storage in all of our wind sites, not only that we own today, but that we might build going forward. The same goes with solar. And then obviously, there's an opportunity now to go ahead and build storage stand-alone. And so that is terrific, not only for Energy Resources, but obviously provides a great opportunity set for NEP going forward as well. In terms of timing, which I think was the other part of your question, I think we've been very open that we plan to provide a further update on the next call in January on the Q4 call. Yes, Julien, we'll do the best we can. Remember, too, that there are some regulations we're working on with the Treasury Department as well. So some of that update around repower and colocated storage might be tied to finalization of those, but we'll certainly try to give a view. Yes. I think, Shahriar, you've got to balance all those things together. First of all, it's really project by project. I mean some projects benefit more than others, and that really depends on which projects have been impacted by some of the supply chain issues that we have had. That's really the first piece. From an interest rate standpoint, though, I think for -- Kirk dealt with that. I mean, obviously, the current interest rate move is taken into account in our expectations. And I think we've been very prudent and careful about managing that interest rate exposure. I mean we have $15 billion of interest rate swap protection in the book. So I'd really think about it more of -- more as a -- an ITC to PTC versus supply chain trade-offs. Some projects benefit more than others. So you kind of have to go down the list and look at it on a deal-by-deal basis. I will go ahead and take that. David, this is John. We have so many terrific organic opportunities, growth opportunities in front of us. M&A is not an area of focus. I will go ahead and take as well. So FEMA did come forward with some recent proposals. Those have not been put to a final vote yet. I think the best example as to why none of those changes are required is what we just saw with Hurricane Ian. And so when you -- Kirk had some of those remarks in the script, but I think it's worth noting, and obviously, we put this information back in front of FEMA that none of this is necessary. Because if you evaluate what happened in Hurricane Ian, which was the fifth worst most catastrophic storm to ever hit the Continental United States, it passed over 38 to 50 of our solar sites with maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour. We had essentially no impact to our solar generating facilities. About 0.3% of the panels were impacted. And you got to remember, that slight number of impacts that even occurred were on the older sites that have the fixed tracker technology. Now if the new tracker technology, we can move it east to west, we can pivot it to the 35 degrees. The wind cuts right through it. We saw essentially no damage at those sites. The solar held up extremely well. And in some cases, I think probably better than even a gas plant, which are really rated up to only 100 miles an hour. So really happy with the way it all performed. We think the FEMA changes are completely unnecessary, and we are working through that with them with terrific evidence from how our own fleet just performed a couple of weeks ago as a no better case in point. Yes. Michael, I would just add, there's no real deviation from what we shared at the investor conference. So it's in line with the plans that we laid out in terms of roughly $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion a year over the settlement terms."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Steve, it's Rebecca. And I'd be happy to start with that answer. First, let me start with the most important part, which is everything that we're seeing at this point in terms of origination at Energy Resources is just terrific. We're seeing strong demand across all the technologies, strong demand across the different customer groups and strong demand across the country. And I feel terrific about meeting the long-term expectations that we've laid out, including reiterating today of the 27.7 to 36.9 gigawatts of new projects put into service between '22 and '25. And I think the origination for this quarter of the over 2,300 megawatts is a great sign to that, and the momentum remains very strong. As you know and appreciate being involved in the development process, there's always some things that can go wrong as you move forward with developing a project where it could be unforeseen permitting or interconnection issues or something else that gets in the way. And so occasionally, we do remove projects from backlog like we did today. We didn't include the reference to the 2 gigawatts mostly because it's going to be harder and harder as time goes by to identify what's related to issues from circumvention and supply chain versus normal development issues. So I think I'd lean more on the side of giving you context for what's going on against our expectations, what's the current momentum. And both of those are just terrific. Yes, Steve. It continues to be an opportunity for our team to work through challenges that we're experiencing along with the rest of the industry. We've continued to work with the various agencies, most importantly, Customs and Border Control, with our suppliers to bring clarity to these implementing regulations. And while we continue to see progress, it also continues to be slower than we would like. Everything that we've laid out today in terms of our expectations reflect our latest views on when panels will be delivered to us, and we'll be able to bring projects into service for our customers. One of the biggest things that our team has been working on over the last year is how do we mitigate the risks related to these broader geopolitical issues, whether you focus specifically on a circumvention issue or UFLPA or whatever else it might entail. And our suppliers have made tremendous progress on de-risking that. And we've gotten a lot of increased confidence longer term. It will be able to mitigate the issues even if we see some disruption in the short term. Thanks. I appreciate the question. We're really excited about the acquisition. It is about just over 30 projects that do landfill, gas, electricity or renewable natural gas today. And that number in '25 reflects our base case. And in our base case, we are converting a number of those facilities from landfill gas to electricity to renewable natural gas. So it does include the investment that we referenced in the prepared remarks of about $400 million in order to convert them to produce renewable natural gas. One of the reasons why we're really excited about the transaction, though, is there's a lot of optionality in it, and some of which was afforded in the Inflation Reduction Act. One is these projects now qualify for an investment tax credit, which obviously enhances the economics of the conversions. There's also the opportunity to support the further decarbonization or the improving of carbon intensity for blue hydrogen, which really opens up a whole new market for renewable natural gas that we think is going to be very attractive to blue hydrogen producers to enable the full value of the PTC where they otherwise wouldn't have been entitled to the full value of the PTC. And in doing that, we think that creates a real long-term contracted market because a blue hydrogen producer will be very motivated to lock in the value that the renewable natural gas lending will bring to their economics. There's also the opportunity, if it isn't a blue hydrogen contribution, actually to keep some of these assets producing electricity and utilizing what we expect are new regulations coming out of the EPA to enable a pathway for the RINs, the predominant renewable fuel credit that renewable natural gas benefits from today, that there'll be a pathway enabled for electric vehicles. So that might enable us to not invest that $400 million in some or all of those assets to convert them to renewable natural gas. So I think the bottom line is we are very excited about it. We think this is a great platform from which to grow our renewable fuel business, our renewable energy solutions in order to help our customers across the broad set of sectors, both in the power sector and beyond to enable their full decarbonization. Yes. Michael, I think we obviously had a number of comments around this at the investor conference. We certainly have seen increases in costs, both in the -- or the -- actually equipment prices as well as balance the system and the labor to build the projects. I don't know that it's materially changed from what we shared with you a couple of months ago. I think we were at the peak in a lot of commodity prices and even some of the key ones that ultimately affect the inherent costs of our building a project have come down since then. As we think about it long term, we obviously have views on what it's going to look like going forward and that we build those expectations into our Power Purchase Agreement prices with our customers. I think one of the key things to keep in mind, particularly as you think about the overall demand for renewables and other clean energy solutions long term, is that they have such a competitive advantage against the alternatives. So even where we've seen increases in costs, even in some areas, maybe at parity with what we've seen in terms of the strict value that the IRA incentives may have brought in terms of the difference versus prior incentives, what we've seen is that the alternatives have increased even more. And that goes from new build as well as the overall market prices. So from our customer standpoint, which is what -- who we're focused on the most, they are as compelling as they've ever been to incorporate into their solutions, whether that be a power customer to bring down electricity prices for their customers, which is clearly very top of mind for our customers today, but also our non-power sector customers who are finding ways to not only provide a lower carbon intensity product to their customers, but they want to do it at lower cost. And we've got great solutions for them. And thanks for the question. We're very excited about the potential for RNG, in particular, as part of the broad set of solutions we want to offer our customers. So I would say this is just a large step forward in something we've already been working on with smaller investments and some other co-investments with other folks. And we're excited about not only adding these portfolio of projects and the value that this creates for our shareholders, but also using it as a platform for future growth.  As part of this acquisition, building a services company along with it. That's part of what the existing portfolio provides, and we're excited about incorporating those capabilities into our team. And we are excited about both landfill gas and alternative forms of renewable natural gas, including [dairy] long term. So we'll do it both through organic as well as through acquisitions. So -- and all of the above. We're excited about the size of the acquisition space. But before I get too excited, we also need to keep in mind that as the $85 billion to $95 billion of capital we want to invest over the period we laid out at the investor conference, this is approximately $1 billion and change. So a great addition to our portfolio, but still in context, a measured step in the overall portfolio. I'm thrilled with the prospects of hydrogen going forward and not just literally hydrogen itself, but the renewable fuels that, that creates is potential solutions for our customers, whether that's synthetic natural gas as a potential solutions for customers who are looking for 7/24 fully decarbonized power, but also through synthetic jet fuels, synthetic ammonia products, other things that will help bring out of people's supply chain, manufacturing processes, et cetera, their carbon-intensive fuels that they use today. Some of those are not going to be economic literally today, but there's a clear pathway to them being economic in a couple of years, but some of them with the benefit of the IRA incentives are economic today. And at the heart of them, what the opportunity is for us is to deploy a substantial amount of renewable energy in the form of wind, solar, battery storage, the core things that we have been very successful doing for years now, if not decades, and we're continuing to invest heavily to maintain those competitive advantages going forward."

[Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Geoffroy, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.\nJessica Geoffroy: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2022 combined earnings conference call for NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. With me this morning are John Ketchum, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy; Kirk Crews, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NextEra Energy; Rebecca Kujawa, President and Chief Executive Officer of NextEra Energy Resources; and Mark Hickson, Executive Vice President of NextEra Energy. All of whom are also officers of NextEra Energy Partners, as well as Eric Silagy, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Florida Power & Light Company. Kirk will provide an overview of our results and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions. We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factor section of the accompanying presentation, or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our websites, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Florida Power & Light completed the regulatory integration of Gulf Power under its 2021 base rate settlement agreement and began serving customers under unified rates on January 1st, 2022. As a result, Gulf Power will no longer continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy. For 2022 and beyond, FPL has one reporting segment and, therefore, 2021 financial results and other operational metrics have been restated for comparative purposes. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\nKirk Crews: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well-positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% versus the same quarter last year. With residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments such as our planned solar expansion and T&D hardening and undergrounding projects to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy for the benefit of our customers. Having saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs since 2001 and with the largest owned and operated solar portfolio of any utility in the country, FPL is well positioned to execute on its goal of achieving real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045, which we announced last month at our investor conference, while continuing to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a strong environment for renewables development, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts to Energy Resources backlog since the last call. Included in these backlog additions is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of solar projects, which is the second largest quarter of solar origination in our history. As we highlighted at our investor conference last month, we believe that a number of powerful tailwinds support continued, strong renewables demand, particularly in the context of high power prices and high gas prices that are helping to make renewables the most economic form of generation. We expect these economic value drivers for new renewables, coupled with Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages to translate into a tremendous opportunity set as we deliver clean energy solutions to our customers seeking to both lower their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions. We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2022 and heading into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $989 million or $0.50 per share, which is an increase of $107 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 12%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather during the second quarter, we reversed roughly $44 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.37 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. During the quarter, FPL successfully commissioned the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The approximately $900 million project, which was completed on time and on budget, is expected to generate nearly $350 million in net cost savings for FPL customers, while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 70% compared to the previous Lauderdale plant. Longer term, we expect to convert approximately 16 gigawatts of our highly efficient gas fleet to run on green hydrogen, which will play an important role in the decarbonization of FPL's generation fleet as part of our goal to achieve real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045. Last week, FPL also placed in service the North Florida Resiliency Connection transmission line, which physically connects the FPL grid and the legacy Gulf power grid. The new transmission line is expected to generate operational efficiencies and allow customers to benefit from both enhanced reliability and additional low-cost solar generation. FPL also filed its updated storm protection plan, which is filed every three years. The plan provides details on the billions of dollars of capital investment anticipated over the next 10 years to continue hardening FPL's energy grid for the benefit of customers. These hardening programs, several of which have been in progress since 2007, collectively provide increased resiliency and faster restoration times for FPL's approximately 5.8 million customer accounts when severe weather, including hurricanes, inevitably affects our service territory. The Florida economy remains strong. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 3% remains below the national average and its labor force participation rate remains strong. The three-month moving average for new housing permits is up nearly 9% year-over-year, outpacing the national rate by roughly 7%. FPL's new service accounts increased more than 15% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong growth in Florida's economy. FPL's average number of customers increased by more than 87,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued strong underlying population growth as Florida's population continues to increase at one of the fastest rates in the nation. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.2% from the prior year comparable period, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $133 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $683 million or $0.35 per share. The difference between Energy Resources second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results is primarily the effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings. Contributions from new investments were roughly flat versus the prior year, driven by the timing of new solar and storage project additions. For the full year 2022, we anticipate the majority of our growth in new investments to occur in the fourth quarter. Our existing generation and storage assets added $0.03 per share primarily due to favorable wind resource during the second quarter. The second quarter adjusted earnings contributions from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.02 year-over-year, driven primarily by the absence of winter storm Uri impacts that negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the second quarter of last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 versus 2021. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which is the third largest quarter of renewables and storage origination in our history. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 815 net megawatts of new wind, 1,200 net megawatts of solar and 20 net megawatts of battery storage to our backlog. With these additions, net of projects placed in service, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at approximately 19,600 megawatts and provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years. We remain confident in our long-term development expectations at Energy Resources, which we increased and extended last month. From 2022 through the end of 2025, Energy Resources expects to build roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects. To put these numbers in context, this expected renewables and storage build at the midpoint is approximately 30% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. We were pleased that the Biden administration made the decision last month to direct the Department of Commerce to waive additional duties for two years on solar panels imported from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The 24-month time frame is particularly important, as by the end of that period, we expect our suppliers to be making ingots and wafers outside of China. As a reminder, the Department of Commerce staff already publicly stated that panels with wafers made outside of China are not subject to its investigation. The actions by the Biden administration have provided much needed clarity to our suppliers to resume solar module production, recommence shipping of solar panels and for energy resources to restart its solar construction projects that have been halted due to the circumvention investigation. These new developments since our last call reinforce our confidence in both our near-term and long-term development expectations at Energy Resources. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. Beyond renewables and storage, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Water entered into an agreement to purchase a rate-regulated Pennsylvania wastewater system for approximately $115 million. Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we anticipate this transaction will close in mid 2023. Additionally, last week, NextEra Energy Water closed on its previously announced acquisition of a portfolio of rate-regulated water and wastewater utility assets in Texas. These strategic investments should allow us to leverage our world-class operating platform to unlock value for both customers and our shareholders as we explore potential opportunities in the regulated water utility business. At NextEra Energy Transmission, we commissioned the Empire State transmission line earlier this month. This project is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business mix through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets to our portfolio. It is expected to improve system reliability and deliver much needed zero carbon emissions generation to New Yorkers, while supporting the state's goals to decarbonize its grid. So far, in 2022, NextEra Energy Transmission has completed roughly $500 million of greenfield transmission projects. The addition of high-quality transmission projects such as the East West Tie and the Empire State Transmission line furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to accretively deploy capital as well as to enable further renewables development. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.3 billion or $0.70 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were roughly $1.6 billion and $0.81 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from the Corporate & Other segment decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. At our investor conference, we highlighted roughly $400 million in run rate efficiencies identified through project velocity that we expect to be recognized over the next few years. This represents the largest identified cost savings in the history of our company-wide productivity initiatives. In connection with project velocity during the second quarter, we recorded transition costs of approximately $52 million pre-tax, of which $40 million was recorded at FPL and offset with the utilization of reserve amortization. The balance was recorded at Energy Resources and reduced adjusted EPS by roughly $0.01 per share. Our long-term financial expectations through 2025, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. Based upon the clear visibility into meaningful organic growth prospects across all of our businesses, we also remain confident in our near-term capital plan to deploy approximately $85 billion to $95 billion into new investments from 2022 through 2025. In addition, from 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. As a reminder, Energy Resources development expectations and NextEra Energy's financial expectations through 2025 do not assume any change in current tax law. We continue to see strong market demand for renewables, especially in light of the environment of high gas and power prices that we believe will persist going forward. Renewables are not just the most economic form of generation, they are deflationary and countercyclical. Renewable support energy independence, help stimulate economic growth, including domestic job creation. Renewables offer low-cost energy to help customers reduce their bills, and demand is being driven by a number of factors, as we discussed at our June Investor Conference. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy is better positioned than any other company in our industry to capitalize on these market conditions and deliver low-cost renewables and storage to our customers at both FPL and Energy Resources. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 43% and 37%, respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7625 per common unit or $3.05 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 300% since the IPO. Last month at our investor conference, NextEra Energy Partners announced a modification to incentive distribution rights fees, or IDRs, with NextEra Energy. The announced modification flattens IDR payments at $157 million annually based on a minimum annualized distribution rate of $3.05 per common unit. This modified IDR structure will be effective beginning in the third quarter of this year. We expect both NextEra Energy Partners' unitholders and NextEra Energy shareholders to benefit from the IDR modification. NextEra Energy Partners will need fewer asset additions to achieve its growth objectives with reduced equity needs, among other benefits. NextEra Energy expects to benefit from the potential increased value in its investment in NextEra Energy Partners while retaining an attractive incentive distribution fee stream as well as the ability to continue to recycle significant capital through Nexera Energy Partners. Putting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of LP distribution growth and support NextEra Energy Partners' best-in-class distribution per unit growth expectations that we extended last month. NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to further enhance its financing flexibility. In May, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility by approximately $1.25 billion for a total of $2.5 billion in capacity, which is consistent with NextEra Energy Partners' growth since the facility was last upsized in 2019. The facility was approximately 1.6 times oversubscribed, which we believe demonstrates the strong credit quality of the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio as well as the market confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners drew the approximately $410 million of remaining funds from its 2021 convertible equity portfolio financing. The strong demand for both the private investor and lending communities to provide NextEra Energy Partners with liquidity for growth demonstrates the Partnership's continued ability to raise capital at attractive terms. With another strong origination quarter at Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners' growth visibility is as strong as ever, and we remain on track to deliver on our best-in-class 12% to 15% annual distribution per unit growth expectations, which we extended through 2025 last month at our investor conference. Finally, last week, S&P favorably revised NextEra Energy Partners' business risk profile upward, from satisfactory to strong to reflect its positive outlook on the Partnership's continued growth and portfolio diversification while maintaining highly contracted revenue streams with highly rated counterparties. S&P also affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy Partners and lowered his downgrade threshold for its funds from operations, or FFO, to debt metric from the previous level of 14% to the current level of 12%. We believe these favorable adjustments reflect the strength of NextEra Energy Partners business and a stable cash flow generation profile of its portfolio. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $500 million, and cash available for distribution was $207 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $106 million of adjusted EBITDA and $41 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added roughly $51 million of adjusted EBITDA and $26 million of cash available for distribution in the second quarter, driven primarily by favorable wind resource. Wind resource for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 112% of the long-term average versus 93% in the second quarter of 2021. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat fees as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year and LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long [ph] growth prospects at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, that means continuing to deliver our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. means pursuing our industry-leading real zero carbon emissions goal, which we detailed at our investor conference and in our zero-carbon blueprint to decarbonize FPL's operations by no later than 2045. At Energy Resources, we believe that our best-in-class development and operating platform will allow us to maintain our leadership position as we help both power and non-power sector customers save on energy costs and decarbonize operations with the adoption of new renewables and various forms of energy storage. And we expect NextEra Energy Partners to benefit greatly from the significant growth in renewables deployment across the United States, which presents terrific opportunities for acquisitions, both from Energy Resources and from third parties. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thanks. I guess a couple of questions. Just a technical one on the new backlog additions. Could you give us some sense kind of what periods the 2 gigawatts were, is it mainly 2022, 2023 or 2024, 2025?\nKirk Crews: Sure. Good morning, Steve. Thank you. Thank you for the question. So in terms of the new additions that we announced this morning, the wind is sort of split evenly between 2023 and then the 2024 and 2025 time period. For solar, the majority of that is in the 2024 and 2025 time period.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Second question, I know that your plans do not include any BBB or any extension in tax credits at all, but would be curious of just your thoughts on chances for that to happen in tax extenders or kind of separately what the Biden administration might do on renewables with respect to just the executive actions and/or through the EPA?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure, Steve. This is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Like you said, it's not included in our development or financial expectations. So if it happens, great. But our expectations through 2025, as Kirk said in the prepared remarks, assume current tax law. Our view is that renewables are going to continue to get cheaper and cheaper over time. Gas generation, which is what we primarily compete against for new renewables, on the other hand, continues to get more expensive. And we laid that case out, I think in detail at the June investor conference. And when I think about gas prices today, we think they're going to remain elevated over a long period of time. I just think there's a lot of headwinds that gas prices are facing today. One of them is obviously the lack of pipeline Infrastructure. We see significant demand for LNG export in Western Europe. There really is no gas to coal switching anymore, which used to put a cap on gas prices and would limit gas demand during scarcity events. So I think for all those reasons, we're going to continue to see upward pressure on gas prices. And that, when I look at our success this quarter at over 2 gigawatts, for customers, they're looking at that. They're looking at that, and they know that they have significant affordability issues that they are trying to address, and they're really trying to identify anything they can to hedge natural gas prices and natural gas price volatility in the bill. And so that is creating a ton of demand for renewables. And like I said, I don't see that really changing over time. I think we're going to be in a long-term period of heightened natural gas prices, which is really just terrific for renewables creates a ton of demand. On your questions on the views around what the options are for tax reform. First of all, I think reconciliation is somewhat unlikely, obviously, given the positions that have been taken over the last week or so. So our focus really is on extenders and more importantly, on executive actions. So let me take those in order. The first on extenders. Extenders could happen. But there are things on both sides of the aisle that they will want at the end of the year. I mean, you think about the things that are important to Republicans, and I think Senator Grassley put a statement out a couple of days ago saying that all 25 or 26 extenders hinge on the full R&D expense deduction, that is going to be something that's going to be front and center, I think on the Republican wish list, is getting that done, because I think as most folks know that R&D full expensing was eliminated at the end of 2021, and it gets amortized now over five years. So they want to see that extended. We have the interest-deductibility limitation, which converts from EBITDA to EBIT. And at the end of 2022, bonus depreciation starts to scale down. Those are all things that could really drive economic growth. And I think we'll be high on the list in things that we may be able to trade for an extension on renewable credits. So while we're not counting on it, we will continue to do everything we can around extenders to try to support extension of tax credits for renewables. I think executive action, particularly given the statements that were made by the President at the end of last week, there are definitely some things that we can do there. We will continue to work it. We have a number of ideas on our list that we are pursuing at different levels. And I'd like to just leave it at that on the executive branch activity, but feel somewhat optimistic about our ability to get some exciting things done there.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. I\u2019ll let other ask questions. Thank you.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thanks for the time. Maybe just a follow-up from Steve's last question. Focus here on origination, new record in the second quarter here. How are you thinking about the back half of the year? Clearly, to a certain extent, you would think that there would be some hesitancy from customers given the uncertainty on BBB. Considering that maybe those expectations have withered at this point, does that actually mean customers are now in gear to make moves? And could we actually see a further acceleration of origination in the back half of the year, if you follow what I'm saying?\nRebecca Kujawa: Julien, it's Rebecca. I'll take that question. The team is doing a terrific job with ongoing conversations with customers. But as we've highlighted, really since for a very long period of time and consistently even since the start of the year when we've been talking a lot more about disruption across the industry. Interest from customers remains really robust. And that was throughout even the uncertainty around circumvention at the height of it, even around solar. And it really goes back to the heart of what Kirk said in the prepared remarks and what John just commented on a minute or two ago in response to one of Steve's questions, our customers are acutely aware of the value of renewables in their portfolio from an economic standpoint, both in the pure sense of being low cost, but also in the sense of being a terrific offset to inflationary concerns about other forms of generation in their portfolio. And then on top of that they have various commitments that they've talked to, to their own stakeholders about deploying renewables and reducing carbon in their portfolio. So, I think there's this underlying current of demand that has been far less affected than you might think by the headlines in our conversations about what's going on in the industry. So, I would say, the fundamentals are terrific. And as you can see from our origination, I always caution you all not to look at a single quarter in isolation to keep looking at multiple quarters over time. And you can see really strong demand for both wind and solar and battery storage throughout the portfolio. So, I'm thrilled with our conversations with our customers, I'm thrilled with the execution of the team and remain as excited as I've ever been about the prospects for us continuing to execute and delivering new renewables.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, it sounds more consistent, as you say. And then just -- this might seem more of a check the box, but just to clarify this, I mean, we've seen some concerns out there on core site of late and just USLPA, et cetera. I mean I know there's some concerns and perhaps this is more of a review process as a few things are held up here. But I just want to turn back to your prepared comments, et cetera. It sounds like this is not substantively concerned for you guys, at least per your own contracting activities in a way.\nRebecca Kujawa: Julien, we continue to work through supply chain. Of course, you know all the headlines as well as anybody on circumvention. For WRO and the Weaker Force Labor Protection Act, obviously, we have for WRO some history already under our belt for us and for the industry and for the flip implementing regulations. We now have some time in place for those and our conversations with our suppliers remain really constructive. So, we're going to constantly be vigilant as our suppliers, but we continue to see a constructive path forward on being able to put projects in service over time.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. And the only thing that I would add to what Rebecca just said, Julien, is none of our suppliers are on the import panelist. None of our panels have been detained. I think as Rebecca said, the process that will be followed will be much like the WRO which our suppliers are well-versed in dealing with. And there will be a little bit of due diligence on, hey, where do these panels come from? What's the traceability, just like we've seen with WRO? But we believe it's all very manageable.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, excellent. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead with your question.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nJohn Ketchum: Good morning Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Just what's the threshold for removing the language around the 2 gigawatts of projects that you noted in the footnotes that could still be at risk? I mean, can you maybe just elaborate on how the discussions are going with customers? And just given that you've been in discussions for some time, where are you sort of trending as we're thinking about the 1 to 2 gigawatt cancellation range that you sort of highlighted at the Analyst Day. I mean, could we end up with no cancellations. I guess when can we get an update there?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hey Shar, so it's Rebecca, I'll take that question as well. Our conversations, I would say are across the board very constructive and I think throughout this process, we've been very transparent, obviously, with you all and our conversations that we highlighted at the investor conference, but at least as importantly and perhaps more so from my perspective, very transparent and honest with our customers. And it continues to be a process, particularly for the things we just talked about, both for getting back on track from the disruption related to the circumvention investigation and also understanding the implications of WRO and flip as well as understanding our customers' requirements for what is most important to them in terms of of timing and getting their projects in service. I would say, I'm very pleased with the progress on those conversations. I'm optimistic. I think I even said this at the investor conference, there's still a path where there is little to no cancellations across the board. We're not there yet. There's still some ongoing dialogue that we need to have. But irrespective of that, I feel very comfortable with the development expectations that we've laid out that even if there's some disruption with a couple of those contracts, I feel very confident in being able to enter into other contracts and continue the development of other projects such that those ranges that we've provided to you and, of course, gave you again today, remain very much in reach. And our origination for this quarter speaks for itself of being able to continue meaningful progress towards winning those up and creating terrific visibility to where we just need to execute.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. So just -- sorry, if I could just, it sounds like the way the discussions are going, there could be a situation where you see no cancellations.\nRebecca Kujawa: That's certainly possible. But again, most importantly, even if there's some disruption, I also feel really good about being able to have alternatives in place. So I think it's both yes and.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And just wanted to follow up on the transaction value of renewable projects, especially as you're kind of looking at the rising interest rate environment. Do sort of the rising rates present a challenge to monetize projects both through net or third parties? And how do you see the interest rates impacting sort of the economics of the project, the development margins, the IRRs? So is there sort of pricing flexibility to pass those costs without seeing sort of that elasticity in demand?\nJohn Ketchum: So Shar, let me start with, as we've often talked about, we have a number of competitive advantages when it comes to financing the projects. But I think you also need to consider the environment in which we are contracting renewable projects right now. And as John talked about, what the alternative is for the customer. So given the high gas price environment, it certainly provides room for us to have a higher PPA price. And that gives us the ability to offset higher interest rate costs and still maintain our margins. With respect to NextEra Energy Partners as we've shared before, again, a lot of financing options available at NextEra Energy Partners. We've demonstrated over the years, ways to finance the growth in a very cost-efficient way. And we continue to believe that we can utilize all the different financing options that we have to continue to support the growth at NextEra Energy Partners.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll pass it to someone else. Congrats, John and team. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. All my other questions have been answered. I wanted to go to sort of your water and wastewater strategy, and I appreciate it's small part of your business. But maybe just a two-part question there. One, can you talk about your outlook there? Obviously, the Texas deal is now closed and you made a key announcement where you talked about the PA wastewater system on the call today. So, can you discuss your outlook there? Do you see a lot of opportunity to grow there? That's part one. And then part two, how should we think about competition? Here, I'm referring to the local water utilities as you approach these deals. And what's your competitive advantage? Thank you.\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take that. It's obviously, Rebecca. We're very excited about it. As we've talked now a number of quarters, we see a lot of synergies from the competitive strengths that we bring to the table, our size, our approach to being able to focus on cost and on innovation and all of the -- both supply chain and execution that we can bring to the water business. And of course, we find regulated earnings and cash flows very attractive. So there's lots of both structural and strategic reasons why we're interested and we're thrilled with the progress that we've had so far, getting some initial work done in both Texas and Pennsylvania. And I feel really energized by what the team is looking at in terms of opportunities for growth going forward and building more of a platform opportunity. And I think it's key to think about some of the value this brings. There are local utilities out in these communities, and we can help them solve some of the challenges that they see, both the municipals and the entities that run those businesses. So, I think it's terrific. I do want to caveat that relative to the size of our overall business and the capital investments that we're making, it's relatively small. But in all of our broader conversations and investments in renewables and talking to these municipal entities around renewables, there's often opportunities to also bring value to them on the water side and other parts of infrastructure that is meaningful to them. So terrific synergies. I'm really excited about the outlook. We continue to be much more of a renewable company than necessarily a straight water company, but I'm really happy with the progress we've made so far.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you. I appreciate your time. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJohn Ketchum: Hi, good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to pick up maybe with M&A a little bit here. And how does the recently instated real zero goal impact your prospects around M&A going forward? And when you're looking at assets, is there more of an interest on water, as you talked about here? Or how is the appetite varied between water, electric gas?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. So look, I think we've -- as we've discussed before on M&A, we are really excited about the organic growth opportunities we have at both FPL and Energy Resources. At FPL, it is a growing population here in the state, at Energy Resources, it's a fantastic renewable environment. So, as we think about M&A, we will always look, we're always interested, but we're really focused on the organic growth opportunities. And I think Rebecca shared with you sort of the thinking we have around water and whether or not there are opportunities there in water that we can help local municipalities. But in the context of the overall business and the organic growth that we have at both FPL and Energy Resources, it's still a small opportunity set.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thanks for that. And then maybe just coming back to supply chain a little bit more at high-level question. What do you think about the prospects regarding domestic manufacturing? What are your expectations for US market share multiple years down the road? What percentage of panels do you think could be domestically sourced today versus five years in the future?\nJohn Ketchum: This is John. I'll go ahead and take that. I mean, what you're going to continue to see is, I think, really more of an intense focus on what's possible in the US. I mean, I think you've certainly seen our company take a leadership position early on with what we were able to do up in Jacksonville around a panel manufacturing facility. We will continue to look for more opportunities going forward. But I think it's going to be important that we have a diverse approach that looks hard at domestic production opportunities and supporting domestic production opportunities going forward. It's hard to really give you a percentage, but I think you're going to see this industry really focused on ways that we can help create more domestic jobs here on the home front. That's one of the great things about renewables. I mean, renewables are energy independent from a national security standpoint. They\u2019re all within the boundaries of the US and we will continue to focus on developing projects that are fuel independent as well, which will, as I said before, really help, I think, in taking a bite out of the bill in a high natural gas price environment.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nDave Arcaro: Hi. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks so much for taking my question. So I was wondering, just looking at the Energy Resources development outlook, there is a big ramp in solar from the 2022, 2023 period into the 2024, 2025 period. I was wondering, is there an opportunity or any effort to kind of pull forward projects from 2024, 2025 into 2023. Kind of curious how generally 2023 is shaping up in terms of industry growth that year?\nRebecca Kujawa: Dave, its Rebecca. I'll take that. One, as we just think about it from our company's perspective, obviously, we have financial expectations built around the ranges that we've already provided, which anticipates both at 2022, 2023 time frame and 2024, 2025 time frame of in-service. But certainly, as we look out to 2025 and think about that being a substantial solar build year, for us and for the industry for obvious reasons, assuming that there's no change to current tax policy, of course, we're going to think long and hard about how do you optimize that growth. We're already in conversations with our EPC contracts, our labor contracts as well as the physical supply chain needed in order to support that build to ensure that we're on top of it and tracking it accordingly. This is kind of what we do, right? It's -- in our industry, as you all know, there's a history of peaks as you go into a year in which the industry expects to have a change in incentives after that year. So we will prepare for it. I feel very comfortable with where we are today, that we've got the right systems thoughts and execution in place to be successful. But, of course, as you highlighted, we'll look at every possible way to optimize that.\nDave Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, on Florida, I was wondering if you could talk about bill inflation and just approaches that you're pursuing to manage the pressure that we're seeing on customer builds this year? Anything new in the works or creative ways to help spread that cost out or that bill inflation now?\nEric Silagy: Hi Dave, this is Eric Silagy. I'll take that. So look, first off, we continue to be focused on being as efficient as possible. One of the advantages that we have is we have the most fuel-efficient fleet in Florida as well as among the country. But also our solar focus and our big solar build help as well because, frankly, we just burn left gas. So when you look at how much electricity megawatt hours we actually produce every day and look at the non-fuel, we burn, the efficiency is the best way for us to save customers. As Kirk said in his opening remarks, you look at how many billions of dollars that we've actually save customers over the years by simply not charging them for fuel that we simply didn't have to buy. So that remains a key focus for us along with our productivity and our O&M. I'm proud of the continued focus across the entire organization. We have the lowest O&M per kilowatt hour of any utility in America, and we're not satisfied with that. So we're going to continue to do that. So we're tightening our belts to do everything we can to make sure our customer bills remain the lowest among all the IOUs in Florida and among the lowest in the country.\nDave Arcaro: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.\nJames Thalacker: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my call.\nJohn Ketchum: Good morning.\nJames Thalacker: Just a real quick question. Obviously, existing generation of storage and customer supply had a good quarter, quarter-over-quarter. I know obviously some of that was related to the above average wind resource, which rebounded quite a bit. But just wondering, post-Uri, a lot of the generators had restructured some of their contracts. Did you guys see any benefits in 2Q from any sort of maybe changing in your hedging strategy? And could that be something we could see flowing through through the rest of the year?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, sure. So we did not really have any change to the way that we operated our book. Obviously, winter storm Uri was an event where I think everyone who operated in Texas learn some information in terms of the way to position their books. And we certainly have positioned our book to help better manage extreme conditions, both in the winter and the summer, but we did not have any significant changes to the way that we run the business in Texas as a result.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call. We do thank everyone for joining today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well-positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased approximately 14% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. Average regulatory capital employed increased by more than 11% versus the same quarter last year. With residential bills well below the national average and the lowest among all of the Florida investor-owned utilities, FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments such as our planned solar expansion and T&D hardening and undergrounding projects to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy for the benefit of our customers. Having saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs since 2001 and with the largest owned and operated solar portfolio of any utility in the country, FPL is well positioned to execute on its goal of achieving real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045, which we announced last month at our investor conference, while continuing to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.06 year-over-year. We continue to capitalize on a strong environment for renewables development, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts to Energy Resources backlog since the last call. Included in these backlog additions is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of solar projects, which is the second largest quarter of solar origination in our history. As we highlighted at our investor conference last month, we believe that a number of powerful tailwinds support continued, strong renewables demand, particularly in the context of high power prices and high gas prices that are helping to make renewables the most economic form of generation. We expect these economic value drivers for new renewables, coupled with Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages to translate into a tremendous opportunity set as we deliver clean energy solutions to our customers seeking to both lower their energy bills and reduce their carbon emissions. We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2022 and heading into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $989 million or $0.50 per share, which is an increase of $107 million and $0.05 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11.4% over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of FPL's net income growth of approximately 12%. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.9 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total roughly $8.5 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2022. Largely as a result of warm weather during the second quarter, we reversed roughly $44 million of reserve amortization recorded earlier in the year, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1.37 billion to use over the term of the current settlement agreement. During the quarter, FPL successfully commissioned the highly efficient, roughly 1,200 megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center. The approximately $900 million project, which was completed on time and on budget, is expected to generate nearly $350 million in net cost savings for FPL customers, while reducing carbon emissions by roughly 70% compared to the previous Lauderdale plant. Longer term, we expect to convert approximately 16 gigawatts of our highly efficient gas fleet to run on green hydrogen, which will play an important role in the decarbonization of FPL's generation fleet as part of our goal to achieve real zero carbon emissions by no later than 2045. Last week, FPL also placed in service the North Florida Resiliency Connection transmission line, which physically connects the FPL grid and the legacy Gulf power grid. The new transmission line is expected to generate operational efficiencies and allow customers to benefit from both enhanced reliability and additional low-cost solar generation. FPL also filed its updated storm protection plan, which is filed every three years. The plan provides details on the billions of dollars of capital investment anticipated over the next 10 years to continue hardening FPL's energy grid for the benefit of customers. These hardening programs, several of which have been in progress since 2007, collectively provide increased resiliency and faster restoration times for FPL's approximately 5.8 million customer accounts when severe weather, including hurricanes, inevitably affects our service territory. The Florida economy remains strong. Florida's unemployment rate of approximately 3% remains below the national average and its labor force participation rate remains strong. The three-month moving average for new housing permits is up nearly 9% year-over-year, outpacing the national rate by roughly 7%. FPL's new service accounts increased more than 15% year-over-year, demonstrating continued strong growth in Florida's economy. FPL's average number of customers increased by more than 87,000 or 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued strong underlying population growth as Florida's population continues to increase at one of the fastest rates in the nation. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.2% from the prior year comparable period, driven primarily by a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter retail sales increased 1.3% with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported second quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $133 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $683 million or $0.35 per share. The difference between Energy Resources second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results is primarily the effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings. Contributions from new investments were roughly flat versus the prior year, driven by the timing of new solar and storage project additions. For the full year 2022, we anticipate the majority of our growth in new investments to occur in the fourth quarter. Our existing generation and storage assets added $0.03 per share primarily due to favorable wind resource during the second quarter. The second quarter adjusted earnings contributions from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.02 year-over-year, driven primarily by the absence of winter storm Uri impacts that negatively impacted adjusted earnings in the second quarter of last year. All other impacts increased results by $0.01 versus 2021. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, adding approximately 2,035 net megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog, which is the third largest quarter of renewables and storage origination in our history. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 815 net megawatts of new wind, 1,200 net megawatts of solar and 20 net megawatts of battery storage to our backlog. With these additions, net of projects placed in service, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at approximately 19,600 megawatts and provides terrific visibility into the strong growth that is expected at Energy Resources over the next few years. We remain confident in our long-term development expectations at Energy Resources, which we increased and extended last month. From 2022 through the end of 2025, Energy Resources expects to build roughly 28 to 37 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects. To put these numbers in context, this expected renewables and storage build at the midpoint is approximately 30% larger than the entire renewables operating portfolio at Energy Resources today. We were pleased that the Biden administration made the decision last month to direct the Department of Commerce to waive additional duties for two years on solar panels imported from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The 24-month time frame is particularly important, as by the end of that period, we expect our suppliers to be making ingots and wafers outside of China. As a reminder, the Department of Commerce staff already publicly stated that panels with wafers made outside of China are not subject to its investigation. The actions by the Biden administration have provided much needed clarity to our suppliers to resume solar module production, recommence shipping of solar panels and for energy resources to restart its solar construction projects that have been halted due to the circumvention investigation. These new developments since our last call reinforce our confidence in both our near-term and long-term development expectations at Energy Resources. The accompanying slide provides additional details on where our development program at Energy Resources now stands. Beyond renewables and storage, during the quarter, NextEra Energy Water entered into an agreement to purchase a rate-regulated Pennsylvania wastewater system for approximately $115 million. Subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we anticipate this transaction will close in mid 2023. Additionally, last week, NextEra Energy Water closed on its previously announced acquisition of a portfolio of rate-regulated water and wastewater utility assets in Texas. These strategic investments should allow us to leverage our world-class operating platform to unlock value for both customers and our shareholders as we explore potential opportunities in the regulated water utility business. At NextEra Energy Transmission, we commissioned the Empire State transmission line earlier this month. This project is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business mix through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets to our portfolio. It is expected to improve system reliability and deliver much needed zero carbon emissions generation to New Yorkers, while supporting the state's goals to decarbonize its grid. So far, in 2022, NextEra Energy Transmission has completed roughly $500 million of greenfield transmission projects. The addition of high-quality transmission projects such as the East West Tie and the Empire State Transmission line furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to accretively deploy capital as well as to enable further renewables development. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.3 billion or $0.70 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were roughly $1.6 billion and $0.81 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from the Corporate & Other segment decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. At our investor conference, we highlighted roughly $400 million in run rate efficiencies identified through project velocity that we expect to be recognized over the next few years. This represents the largest identified cost savings in the history of our company-wide productivity initiatives. In connection with project velocity during the second quarter, we recorded transition costs of approximately $52 million pre-tax, of which $40 million was recorded at FPL and offset with the utilization of reserve amortization. The balance was recorded at Energy Resources and reduced adjusted EPS by roughly $0.01 per share. Our long-term financial expectations through 2025, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.90. For 2023 and 2024, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the ranges of $2.98 to $3.13 and $3.23 to $3.43, respectively. For 2025, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the 2024 adjusted earnings per share range, which translates to a range of $3.45 to $3.70. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. Inclusive of the increases in our expectations in both January and June of this year, NextEra Energy's adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate from 2021 to the high end of our range for 2025. Based upon the clear visibility into meaningful organic growth prospects across all of our businesses, we also remain confident in our near-term capital plan to deploy approximately $85 billion to $95 billion into new investments from 2022 through 2025. In addition, from 2021 to 2025, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. As a reminder, Energy Resources development expectations and NextEra Energy's financial expectations through 2025 do not assume any change in current tax law. We continue to see strong market demand for renewables, especially in light of the environment of high gas and power prices that we believe will persist going forward. Renewables are not just the most economic form of generation, they are deflationary and countercyclical. Renewable support energy independence, help stimulate economic growth, including domestic job creation. Renewables offer low-cost energy to help customers reduce their bills, and demand is being driven by a number of factors, as we discussed at our June Investor Conference. We continue to believe that NextEra Energy is better positioned than any other company in our industry to capitalize on these market conditions and deliver low-cost renewables and storage to our customers at both FPL and Energy Resources. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered outstanding operational and financial performance for the quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up approximately 43% and 37%, respectively against the prior year comparable quarter. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7625 per common unit or $3.05 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 300% since the IPO. Last month at our investor conference, NextEra Energy Partners announced a modification to incentive distribution rights fees, or IDRs, with NextEra Energy. The announced modification flattens IDR payments at $157 million annually based on a minimum annualized distribution rate of $3.05 per common unit. This modified IDR structure will be effective beginning in the third quarter of this year. We expect both NextEra Energy Partners' unitholders and NextEra Energy shareholders to benefit from the IDR modification. NextEra Energy Partners will need fewer asset additions to achieve its growth objectives with reduced equity needs, among other benefits. NextEra Energy expects to benefit from the potential increased value in its investment in NextEra Energy Partners while retaining an attractive incentive distribution fee stream as well as the ability to continue to recycle significant capital through Nexera Energy Partners. Putting it all together, these benefits are expected to provide a longer runway of LP distribution growth and support NextEra Energy Partners' best-in-class distribution per unit growth expectations that we extended last month. NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to further enhance its financing flexibility. In May, NextEra Energy Partners increased the size of its revolving credit facility by approximately $1.25 billion for a total of $2.5 billion in capacity, which is consistent with NextEra Energy Partners' growth since the facility was last upsized in 2019. The facility was approximately 1.6 times oversubscribed, which we believe demonstrates the strong credit quality of the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio as well as the market confidence in NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook. Additionally, NextEra Energy Partners drew the approximately $410 million of remaining funds from its 2021 convertible equity portfolio financing. The strong demand for both the private investor and lending communities to provide NextEra Energy Partners with liquidity for growth demonstrates the Partnership's continued ability to raise capital at attractive terms. With another strong origination quarter at Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners' growth visibility is as strong as ever, and we remain on track to deliver on our best-in-class 12% to 15% annual distribution per unit growth expectations, which we extended through 2025 last month at our investor conference. Finally, last week, S&P favorably revised NextEra Energy Partners' business risk profile upward, from satisfactory to strong to reflect its positive outlook on the Partnership's continued growth and portfolio diversification while maintaining highly contracted revenue streams with highly rated counterparties. S&P also affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy Partners and lowered his downgrade threshold for its funds from operations, or FFO, to debt metric from the previous level of 14% to the current level of 12%. We believe these favorable adjustments reflect the strength of NextEra Energy Partners business and a stable cash flow generation profile of its portfolio. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners' second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $500 million, and cash available for distribution was $207 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2021, contributed approximately $106 million of adjusted EBITDA and $41 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added roughly $51 million of adjusted EBITDA and $26 million of cash available for distribution in the second quarter, driven primarily by favorable wind resource. Wind resource for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 112% of the long-term average versus 93% in the second quarter of 2021. Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022, which we increased last month at our investor conference, remain unchanged. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat fees as an operating expense. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year and LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. Additional details of our long-term distribution per unit expectations are shown on the accompanying slide. In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long [ph] growth prospects at both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, that means continuing to deliver our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. means pursuing our industry-leading real zero carbon emissions goal, which we detailed at our investor conference and in our zero-carbon blueprint to decarbonize FPL's operations by no later than 2045. At Energy Resources, we believe that our best-in-class development and operating platform will allow us to maintain our leadership position as we help both power and non-power sector customers save on energy costs and decarbonize operations with the adoption of new renewables and various forms of energy storage. And we expect NextEra Energy Partners to benefit greatly from the significant growth in renewables deployment across the United States, which presents terrific opportunities for acquisitions, both from Energy Resources and from third parties. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions. Sure. Good morning, Steve. Thank you. Thank you for the question. So in terms of the new additions that we announced this morning, the wind is sort of split evenly between 2023 and then the 2024 and 2025 time period. For solar, the majority of that is in the 2024 and 2025 time period."

            "content": "Hi Dave, this is Eric Silagy. I'll take that. So look, first off, we continue to be focused on being as efficient as possible. One of the advantages that we have is we have the most fuel-efficient fleet in Florida as well as among the country. But also our solar focus and our big solar build help as well because, frankly, we just burn left gas. So when you look at how much electricity megawatt hours we actually produce every day and look at the non-fuel, we burn, the efficiency is the best way for us to save customers. As Kirk said in his opening remarks, you look at how many billions of dollars that we've actually save customers over the years by simply not charging them for fuel that we simply didn't have to buy. So that remains a key focus for us along with our productivity and our O&M. I'm proud of the continued focus across the entire organization. We have the lowest O&M per kilowatt hour of any utility in America, and we're not satisfied with that. So we're going to continue to do that. So we're tightening our belts to do everything we can to make sure our customer bills remain the lowest among all the IOUs in Florida and among the lowest in the country."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Julien, it's Rebecca. I'll take that question. The team is doing a terrific job with ongoing conversations with customers. But as we've highlighted, really since for a very long period of time and consistently even since the start of the year when we've been talking a lot more about disruption across the industry. Interest from customers remains really robust. And that was throughout even the uncertainty around circumvention at the height of it, even around solar. And it really goes back to the heart of what Kirk said in the prepared remarks and what John just commented on a minute or two ago in response to one of Steve's questions, our customers are acutely aware of the value of renewables in their portfolio from an economic standpoint, both in the pure sense of being low cost, but also in the sense of being a terrific offset to inflationary concerns about other forms of generation in their portfolio. And then on top of that they have various commitments that they've talked to, to their own stakeholders about deploying renewables and reducing carbon in their portfolio. So, I think there's this underlying current of demand that has been far less affected than you might think by the headlines in our conversations about what's going on in the industry. So, I would say, the fundamentals are terrific. And as you can see from our origination, I always caution you all not to look at a single quarter in isolation to keep looking at multiple quarters over time. And you can see really strong demand for both wind and solar and battery storage throughout the portfolio. So, I'm thrilled with our conversations with our customers, I'm thrilled with the execution of the team and remain as excited as I've ever been about the prospects for us continuing to execute and delivering new renewables. Julien, we continue to work through supply chain. Of course, you know all the headlines as well as anybody on circumvention. For WRO and the Weaker Force Labor Protection Act, obviously, we have for WRO some history already under our belt for us and for the industry and for the flip implementing regulations. We now have some time in place for those and our conversations with our suppliers remain really constructive. So, we're going to constantly be vigilant as our suppliers, but we continue to see a constructive path forward on being able to put projects in service over time. Hey Shar, so it's Rebecca, I'll take that question as well. Our conversations, I would say are across the board very constructive and I think throughout this process, we've been very transparent, obviously, with you all and our conversations that we highlighted at the investor conference, but at least as importantly and perhaps more so from my perspective, very transparent and honest with our customers. And it continues to be a process, particularly for the things we just talked about, both for getting back on track from the disruption related to the circumvention investigation and also understanding the implications of WRO and flip as well as understanding our customers' requirements for what is most important to them in terms of of timing and getting their projects in service. I would say, I'm very pleased with the progress on those conversations. I'm optimistic. I think I even said this at the investor conference, there's still a path where there is little to no cancellations across the board. We're not there yet. There's still some ongoing dialogue that we need to have. But irrespective of that, I feel very comfortable with the development expectations that we've laid out that even if there's some disruption with a couple of those contracts, I feel very confident in being able to enter into other contracts and continue the development of other projects such that those ranges that we've provided to you and, of course, gave you again today, remain very much in reach. And our origination for this quarter speaks for itself of being able to continue meaningful progress towards winning those up and creating terrific visibility to where we just need to execute. That's certainly possible. But again, most importantly, even if there's some disruption, I also feel really good about being able to have alternatives in place. So I think it's both yes and. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take that. It's obviously, Rebecca. We're very excited about it. As we've talked now a number of quarters, we see a lot of synergies from the competitive strengths that we bring to the table, our size, our approach to being able to focus on cost and on innovation and all of the -- both supply chain and execution that we can bring to the water business. And of course, we find regulated earnings and cash flows very attractive. So there's lots of both structural and strategic reasons why we're interested and we're thrilled with the progress that we've had so far, getting some initial work done in both Texas and Pennsylvania. And I feel really energized by what the team is looking at in terms of opportunities for growth going forward and building more of a platform opportunity. And I think it's key to think about some of the value this brings. There are local utilities out in these communities, and we can help them solve some of the challenges that they see, both the municipals and the entities that run those businesses. So, I think it's terrific. I do want to caveat that relative to the size of our overall business and the capital investments that we're making, it's relatively small. But in all of our broader conversations and investments in renewables and talking to these municipal entities around renewables, there's often opportunities to also bring value to them on the water side and other parts of infrastructure that is meaningful to them. So terrific synergies. I'm really excited about the outlook. We continue to be much more of a renewable company than necessarily a straight water company, but I'm really happy with the progress we've made so far. Dave, its Rebecca. I'll take that. One, as we just think about it from our company's perspective, obviously, we have financial expectations built around the ranges that we've already provided, which anticipates both at 2022, 2023 time frame and 2024, 2025 time frame of in-service. But certainly, as we look out to 2025 and think about that being a substantial solar build year, for us and for the industry for obvious reasons, assuming that there's no change to current tax policy, of course, we're going to think long and hard about how do you optimize that growth. We're already in conversations with our EPC contracts, our labor contracts as well as the physical supply chain needed in order to support that build to ensure that we're on top of it and tracking it accordingly. This is kind of what we do, right? It's -- in our industry, as you all know, there's a history of peaks as you go into a year in which the industry expects to have a change in incentives after that year. So we will prepare for it. I feel very comfortable with where we are today, that we've got the right systems thoughts and execution in place to be successful. But, of course, as you highlighted, we'll look at every possible way to optimize that."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Sure, Steve. This is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Like you said, it's not included in our development or financial expectations. So if it happens, great. But our expectations through 2025, as Kirk said in the prepared remarks, assume current tax law. Our view is that renewables are going to continue to get cheaper and cheaper over time. Gas generation, which is what we primarily compete against for new renewables, on the other hand, continues to get more expensive. And we laid that case out, I think in detail at the June investor conference. And when I think about gas prices today, we think they're going to remain elevated over a long period of time. I just think there's a lot of headwinds that gas prices are facing today. One of them is obviously the lack of pipeline Infrastructure. We see significant demand for LNG export in Western Europe. There really is no gas to coal switching anymore, which used to put a cap on gas prices and would limit gas demand during scarcity events. So I think for all those reasons, we're going to continue to see upward pressure on gas prices. And that, when I look at our success this quarter at over 2 gigawatts, for customers, they're looking at that. They're looking at that, and they know that they have significant affordability issues that they are trying to address, and they're really trying to identify anything they can to hedge natural gas prices and natural gas price volatility in the bill. And so that is creating a ton of demand for renewables. And like I said, I don't see that really changing over time. I think we're going to be in a long-term period of heightened natural gas prices, which is really just terrific for renewables creates a ton of demand. On your questions on the views around what the options are for tax reform. First of all, I think reconciliation is somewhat unlikely, obviously, given the positions that have been taken over the last week or so. So our focus really is on extenders and more importantly, on executive actions. So let me take those in order. The first on extenders. Extenders could happen. But there are things on both sides of the aisle that they will want at the end of the year. I mean, you think about the things that are important to Republicans, and I think Senator Grassley put a statement out a couple of days ago saying that all 25 or 26 extenders hinge on the full R&D expense deduction, that is going to be something that's going to be front and center, I think on the Republican wish list, is getting that done, because I think as most folks know that R&D full expensing was eliminated at the end of 2021, and it gets amortized now over five years. So they want to see that extended. We have the interest-deductibility limitation, which converts from EBITDA to EBIT. And at the end of 2022, bonus depreciation starts to scale down. Those are all things that could really drive economic growth. And I think we'll be high on the list in things that we may be able to trade for an extension on renewable credits. So while we're not counting on it, we will continue to do everything we can around extenders to try to support extension of tax credits for renewables. I think executive action, particularly given the statements that were made by the President at the end of last week, there are definitely some things that we can do there. We will continue to work it. We have a number of ideas on our list that we are pursuing at different levels. And I'd like to just leave it at that on the executive branch activity, but feel somewhat optimistic about our ability to get some exciting things done there. Thank you. Yes. And the only thing that I would add to what Rebecca just said, Julien, is none of our suppliers are on the import panelist. None of our panels have been detained. I think as Rebecca said, the process that will be followed will be much like the WRO which our suppliers are well-versed in dealing with. And there will be a little bit of due diligence on, hey, where do these panels come from? What's the traceability, just like we've seen with WRO? But we believe it's all very manageable. Good morning Shar. So Shar, let me start with, as we've often talked about, we have a number of competitive advantages when it comes to financing the projects. But I think you also need to consider the environment in which we are contracting renewable projects right now. And as John talked about, what the alternative is for the customer. So given the high gas price environment, it certainly provides room for us to have a higher PPA price. And that gives us the ability to offset higher interest rate costs and still maintain our margins. With respect to NextEra Energy Partners as we've shared before, again, a lot of financing options available at NextEra Energy Partners. We've demonstrated over the years, ways to finance the growth in a very cost-efficient way. And we continue to believe that we can utilize all the different financing options that we have to continue to support the growth at NextEra Energy Partners. Hi, good morning, Jeremy. Sure. So look, I think we've -- as we've discussed before on M&A, we are really excited about the organic growth opportunities we have at both FPL and Energy Resources. At FPL, it is a growing population here in the state, at Energy Resources, it's a fantastic renewable environment. So, as we think about M&A, we will always look, we're always interested, but we're really focused on the organic growth opportunities. And I think Rebecca shared with you sort of the thinking we have around water and whether or not there are opportunities there in water that we can help local municipalities. But in the context of the overall business and the organic growth that we have at both FPL and Energy Resources, it's still a small opportunity set. This is John. I'll go ahead and take that. I mean, what you're going to continue to see is, I think, really more of an intense focus on what's possible in the US. I mean, I think you've certainly seen our company take a leadership position early on with what we were able to do up in Jacksonville around a panel manufacturing facility. We will continue to look for more opportunities going forward. But I think it's going to be important that we have a diverse approach that looks hard at domestic production opportunities and supporting domestic production opportunities going forward. It's hard to really give you a percentage, but I think you're going to see this industry really focused on ways that we can help create more domestic jobs here on the home front. That's one of the great things about renewables. I mean, renewables are energy independent from a national security standpoint. They're all within the boundaries of the US and we will continue to focus on developing projects that are fuel independent as well, which will, as I said before, really help, I think, in taking a bite out of the bill in a high natural gas price environment. Good morning. Yes, sure. So we did not really have any change to the way that we operated our book. Obviously, winter storm Uri was an event where I think everyone who operated in Texas learn some information in terms of the way to position their books. And we certainly have positioned our book to help better manage extreme conditions, both in the winter and the summer, but we did not have any significant changes to the way that we run the business in Texas as a result."

With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk.\nKirk Crews: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong first quarter results and is off to a solid start to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10.4% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of our underlying businesses. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in its sector of Fortune Magazine's world's most admired companies list for the 15th time in 16 years. Our culture of commitment to excellence in everything we do and our core values are what allow our team of approximately 15,000 employees to continue delivering best-in-class value to our customers and shareholders while helping build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. FPL increased net income by approximately $98 million from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter, FPL successfully placed in-service, approximately 450 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects that are recovered through base rates as part of its new four year settlement agreement, which as a reminder became effective on January 1st of this year. As a result, FPL has now completed on time and within budget all of its planned solar build with 2022 in service dates. FPL now owns and operates more than 3,600 megawatts of solar, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. FPL's modernization investments since 2001 have saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs and its customers have benefited from a 45% improvement in reliability over the last decade. FPL's other major capital investments are progressing well, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the highly efficient approximately 1,200 megawatts Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, both of which are scheduled for completion later this year. By executing on smart capital investments such as these and running the business efficiently, FPL continues to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable performance in our existing wind portfolio. In terms of new origination, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of renewables and storage origination adding approximately 1,770 net megawatts to our backlog since the last call bringing our backlog total to approximately 17,700 megawatts. Included in the additions this quarter is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects, which is the second largest quarter of wind origination in our history. In the midst of inflationary pressures and uncertainty in solar supply chain, which I will discuss further in a few moments, our continued origination success in this environment is a testament to the strength of Energy Resources' competitive advantages and the ongoing demand from our customers for low cost renewals and storage. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our team's execution and progress at both FPL and Energy Resources. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $875 million, or $0.44 per share, an increase of $0.05 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.3% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2022 capital investments at FPL to be between $7.9 billion and $8.3 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2022. Under our rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12 month period. In this case, the 11.6% that I previously mentioned. While we initially expected to earn below our targeted ROE in the early part of 2022, a combination of warm weather, operational efficiencies and outstanding execution by the team resulted in us achieving our targeted 11.6% ROE while using $124 million of reserve amortization available under our current settlement agreement during the first quarter. Turning to our development and planning efforts, FPL recently filed its Annual Ten-Year Site Plan that presents our recommended generation resource plan through 2031. The recommended Ten-Year Site Plan includes roughly 9,500 megawatts of new solar capacity across our service territory over the next ten years, which would result in nearly 20% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2031 coming from solar generation. This planned solar build-out includes nearly 1,200 megawatts of base rate solar projects inclusive of the approximately 450 megawatts placed in service during the first quarter that we plan to build over the next two years. In addition, it includes approximately 1,800 megawatts under the SoBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement, approximately 1,800 megawatts of SolarTogether community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next four years, as well as roughly 4,700 megawatts of additional solar after 2025, that is subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission. FPL continues to deliver what is one of the largest-ever solar expansions in the U.S. Compared to current levels, the recommended plan projects an approximately 65% increase in zero-carbon-emissions electricity produced by the FPL system over the next decade, largely as a result of FPL\u2019s continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan, which we now expect to complete by 2025, and the solar additions that I previously mentioned. This projected increase in zero carbon-emissions generation is significant for a utility system of our size, especially when considering that our total amount of energy delivered in 2031 is expected to be nearly 10 percentage points higher through customer growth and increased adoption of electric vehicles. Our green hydrogen pilot program plans are also reiterated in the site plan. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, we intend to build an approximately 25-megawatt electrolysis system at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that will be powered entirely by solar energy from a nearby site. The pilot is designed to test, in practice, the concept of replacing natural gas with green hydrogen as fuel for combined cycle unit use. The pilot project is expected to guide the way for future use of hydrogen as a fuel source across FPL\u2019s fleet of highly efficient combined cycle units, thus lowering or eliminating carbon emissions from FPL\u2019s fleet in the future. This pilot project is projected to go into service in late 2023. Notably, our as-filed 10-year site plan recommends a total expected deployment of approximately 3,200 megawatts of new battery storage capacity by 2031. Included in this total is approximately 1,400 megawatts of incremental battery storage to enhance readiness and reliability for our customers during potential extreme weather events. We also plan to make other smart capital investments for winterization efforts designed to support potential increased customer load during extreme winter temperature conditions, while also providing additional day-to-day reliability benefits for customers. A hallmark of our culture is taking every opportunity to learn from events that happen in our industry, not just those that directly affect FPL, to ensure we continue to deliver the best possible value to our customers. Our planned targeted investments for winterization were identified as a result of our detailed assessment of our fleet following Winter Storm Uri last year that affected Texas and much of the South. We will provide additional detail on these programs and our other capital initiatives at our June investor conference. The Florida economy remains healthy and Florida\u2019s population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the U.S. Florida\u2019s job market continues to show healthy results, with more than 700,000 new private sector jobs added over the last year, and Florida\u2019s labor force participation rate is up nearly 2% year-over-year. Other positive economic data across the state include the continued strength of Florida\u2019s real estate market, with the three-month moving average for new housing permits up nearly 20% year-over-year. FPL\u2019s average number of customers increased by more than 91,000, or 1.6%, versus the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL\u2019s first quarter retail sales increased 2.6% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 0.7% of this increase can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.9%, with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported a first quarter 2022 GAAP loss of approximately $1.5 billion, or $0.76 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $628 million, or $0.32 per share, up $0.02 versus the prior-year comparable period. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources\u2019 first quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. As a reminder, this quarter\u2019s GAAP results were also impacted by the write-off of our remaining investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. Contributions from new investments were roughly flat year-over-year, while our existing generation and storage assets added $0.05 per share due to favorable wind resource and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business decreased by $0.02 per share and NextEra Energy Transmission increased results by $0.01 per share year-over-year. The comparative contribution from our gas infrastructure business decreased results by $0.02 per share following favorable performance in the first quarter of last year during Winter Storm Uri. All other impacts were roughly flat versus 2021. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, which is reflective of our ability to continue leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver clean energy solutions to meet the ongoing market demand for renewables. Since the last call, we added approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new wind projects for 2022, 2023 and 2024 commercial operations dates to our backlog. Our backlog additions also include approximately 440 megawatts of solar projects and approximately 130 megawatts of battery storage projects. With more than 2.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have now signed more than 85% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a review of an anti-dumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from four Southeast Asian countries, which in recent years sourced over 80% of all solar panel imports into the United States. As we recently highlighted, we are disappointed by the Commerce Department\u2019s decision to conduct this investigation. We believe the Commerce Department already settled this issue when it concluded in 2012 that the process of converting solar wafers into electricity-producing solar cells is technologically sophisticated and the most capital intensive part of the solar panel manufacturing process, and when that occurs outside of China, the cells are not subject to the 2012 anti-dumping and countervailing duties applicable to Chinese solar cell imports. The Commerce Department\u2019s later rulings in 2014, 2020 and 2021 are consistent with this and have been relied upon by the solar industry as it continued to invest billions of dollars in new solar generating facilities in the United States over this period. In light of these four prior rulings, the reliance on them by the industry and the substantial, technologically sophisticated processing that occurs in the Southeast Asian countries, we believe it will be difficult for the Commerce Department to conclude under its circumvention standards that circumvention of the 2012 tariffs is actually occurring. If the Commerce Department were to find circumvention in the current investigation, we believe it would be unwinding a decade of consistent trade practice across the past three administrations, including the current administration just last year. We believe such a decision would create significant price uncertainty as additional tariffs on panels from the four Southeast Asian countries would likely remain unknown until close to 2025, as final tariff amounts are not determined for about two years after the year of importation. This price uncertainty would likely result in the unintended consequence of U.S. solar panel supply once again being sourced significantly from China, because the tariffs applicable to imports from China are more certain based on 10 years of assessed duty history. U.S. solar panel assemblers are, for the most part, sold out of solar panels through 2024 and, even at full capacity, are only capable of serving 10% to 20% of the U.S. solar panel demand in the first place. It should also be noted that nearly all of the large domestic solar panel assemblers in the U.S. do not support the efforts behind the circumvention claim or the Commerce Department\u2019s decision to investigate, as they also primarily rely on imported cells from Southeast Asia to produce their panels in the United States. And all of the uncertainty from the investigation is occurring at a time when natural gas, coal and oil prices have increased dramatically, leaving solar and storage as one of the few ways to alleviate inflationary pressures on electricity prices. For these reasons, among others, we are optimistic that the investigation will ultimately be resolved favorably and the Commerce Department will conclude not to impose additional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on cells and panels sourced from these Southeast Asian countries. We believe that NextEra Energy is as well positioned as any company in the industry to manage these issues. However, given that a number of suppliers are not expected to ship panels to the U.S. until the Commerce Department makes a preliminary determination as late as August, we continue to expect some of our solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by this delay. We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to assess the potential impacts of this investigation and are optimistic about our ability to arrive at acceptable mitigation measures. Based on what we know today, we believe that approximately 2.1 gigawatts to 2.8 gigawatts of our expected 2022 solar and storage build may shift from 2022 to 2023. Despite the delay, given our competitive advantages, including the strength of our supplier relationships and contracts, we remain comfortable with our current development expectations for wind, solar and storage, which are to build roughly 23 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts over the four-year period from 2021 through the end of 2024. We run a diversified business at Energy Resources that includes multiple renewable energy technologies and provides a natural hedge against temporary disruptions like the one our industry is currently experiencing. In fact, in light of the uncertainty in the solar supply chain, we believe renewable demand will likely temporarily shift in part from solar to wind, and we believe Energy Resources has terrific competitive advantages in wind development. The accompanying slide provides additional details. Finally, during the quarter NextEra Energy Transmission, along with its partners, completed the construction of the East-West Tie Transmission Line Project. The 450-kilometer, 230-kilovolt transmission line runs from Wawa to Thunder Bay, Ontario and is expected to address long-standing regional transmission constraints, thereby increasing much-needed access to energy to support new economic growth in the region for years to come. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2022, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $415 [ph] million, or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy\u2019s 2022 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.46 billion and $0.74 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended earlier this year through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range. NextEra Energy is in a strong position to meet its financial expectations through 2025, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. A big part of NextEra Energy\u2019s culture is a focus on continuous improvement and productivity. To that end, we are currently wrapping up our company-wide productivity initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. Project Velocity built upon the success of Project Momentum and Project Accelerate, which were launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The employee-generated ideas implemented through Project Momentum and Project Accelerate are projected to deliver more than $1.8 billion in average annual run-rate savings first, our cost projections just 10 years ago. In fact, the ideas generated this year in Project Velocity alone are expected to reach roughly $400 million in additional run-rate efficiencies in the next few years, representing the largest identified O&M cost savings in the history of these programs. This result is another example of the strength of our culture and team and highlights our continued focus on productivity and our team\u2019s willingness to embrace innovation and leverage technology. From 2021 to 2025, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered solid first quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA of more than 16% driven primarily by contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of renewables and storage added during 2021. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7325 per common unit, or $2.93 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distributions per unit by more than 290% since the IPO. Further building upon that strength, NextEra Energy Partners today is announcing that it has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 67% interest in an approximately 230-megawatt, four-hour battery storage facility in California that is fully contracted with an investment grade counterparty for 15 years. The acquisition will further diversify NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 existing portfolio with the addition of another battery storage project and is an excellent complement to NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 existing operations. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the project interest for approximately $191 million, subject to closing adjustments, which is expected to be funded with existing debt capacity. NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 share of the asset\u2019s tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $80 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $30 million to $35 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $13 million to $18 million, each on a five-year average annual run-rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. The transaction is expected to close later this year, upon the project reaching its commercial operations date, and supports NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 projected adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution growth in 2022. Finally, NextEra Energy Partners recently closed on a transaction to sell an approximately 156-mile gas pipeline from its existing portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $203 million to a third party. The sale price of the pipeline represents an attractive and accretive EBITDA multiple and further enhances the renewable energy profile of NextEra Energy Partners. We are pleased with this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds into accretive renewable energy assets, like the battery storage acquisition from Energy Resources that I just mentioned, to support NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 long-term distribution growth expectations. Turning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners\u2019 first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $412 million and cash available for distribution was $169 million. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed in the second half of 2021, contributed approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA and $25 million of cash available for distribution. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution existing projects declined $9 million and $29 million respectively, versus the prior year comparable quarter. Favorable performance at existing projects drove an increase in adjusted EBITDA contributions of approximately $46 million year-over-year, which was more than offset by the absence of approximately $55 million in benefits realized during the last February's Winter Storm Uri. Excluding the positive impact of Winter Storm Uri from last year's first quarter results, this quarter's adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up nearly 38% and 31%, respectively, year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was also impacted by the timing of PAYGO payments. Wind resource for the first quarter of 2022 was 108% of the long-term average versus 98% in the first quarter of 2021. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2022, to be in the ranges of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and $675 million to $765 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2022 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We do not expect the recent solar supply chain disruption to impact our ability to deliver on these expectations. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low-80% range. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our businesses. We look forward to sharing more detail with you on our growth plans for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners at our investor conference in New York on June 14. Before taking your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to John Ketchum.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you, Kirk, and good morning, everyone. I am excited for the opportunity to talk to you in my new role. Since we announced our planned leadership succession in January, we have heard from many of our shareholders and industry analysts. Several of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new CEO. The short answer is that I expect our strategy to be consistent with how we have grown the company over the past several decades, but that we will continue to adapt and evolve our strategy to meet increasing customer expectations, to leverage new technologies and to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy. Now is the time for our company, our industry and our country to embrace low-cost renewable energy like never before. We need to create more jobs, not less, and combat the impacts of higher inflation, higher oil and natural gas prices and rising electricity demand by supporting, not stymying, solar and storage development. Our strategy going forward is to build down on our core businesses. At FPL, we expect one of the highest population growth rates of any state in the nation to continue. In fact, at our current rate of organic customer growth, FPL would add a customer base the size of Gulf Power roughly every five years. FPL's undergrounding program is just getting started, and we have visibility to billions of dollars in capital investment for the next several decades to continue hardening and strengthening the grid as we deliver industry-leading reliability to our customers. And we are also just getting started at decarbonizing the generation fleet at FPL as only about 5% of our generation in FPL is currently produced by renewable energy. I believe that FPL already is the best utility in the nation. And yet we see significant cost reduction and incremental capital investment opportunities at FPL over the next several decades that can further improve our industry-leading customer value proposition by delivering clean, low-cost energy solutions for Florida customers. Our strategy also entails doubling down on our core at Energy Resources. We intend to build more wind, more solar and more battery stores than anybody else in this country year in and year out regardless of the headwinds or tailwinds in any given year. We believe that we have the competitive advantages to win under any market conditions. And with recent technological advancements in green hydrogen and other forms of long-term storage, we see a total addressable market in this country for renewables, storage and transmission of around $8 trillion through 2050. We have said this before, and we believe it is never more true than it is today: the opportunity set for renewable energy in this country continues to expand rapidly, and we believe Energy Resources is in a terrific position for continued industry leadership and for long-term growth for shareholders. Both FPL and Energy Resources have multiple ways to grow, and each business continues to push the other to be even better. As FPL grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in Florida. As Energy Resources grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in other markets across the country. Operational excellence is a competitive advantage for us across both businesses, so as development and construction expertise, so as supply chain management, so as financial discipline. Both businesses are constantly implementing new technologies. Both businesses are constantly finding ways to do things more efficiently and to improve our cost position. As Kirk mentioned, this year, our employees generated about 900 individual ideas translating into roughly $400 million in additional run rate O&M savings across the enterprise through Project Velocity, our best performance ever after 10 years of pursuing O&M improvement in this employee-driven annual exercise. Our strategy at NextEra Energy is to continue to do what we have done well, only better and bigger as new market opportunities present themselves. Our strategy at NextEra Energy Partners is much the same. The partnership will double down on what we have done well since our IPO in 2014. We expect to continue delivering LP distribution growth that is already best-in-class. We plan to continue to pursue growth in three ways: by acquiring assets from Energy Resources, by acquiring assets from third parties and by additional organic capital investments in the assets we own as the portfolio grows over time. Yet as at NextEra Energy, it is the future of the partnership and its long-term growth visibility that is most exciting to us. Simply put, we believe that what is good for NextEra Energy tends to be good for NextEra Energy Partners, and what is good for decarbonization of the U.S. economy is going to be terrific for shareholders of NextEra Energy as well as for unitholders of NextEra Energy Partners. We will have more to share about our long-term growth prospects at both companies at our investor conference in June. I'd like to close by once again thanking our team. In addition to the 900 Project Velocity ideas I mentioned earlier, last week, we held our annual team competition for the Highest Quality and Innovation Award at our company, followed by our Employee Expo in which 56 teams were featured. I can tell you that, as impressive as our track record has been over the last 30-plus years, our future is even brighter. Our team continues to impress with their creativity, analytical abilities, innovation, customer focus and the will to win. I truly believe that we have the best team in the industry. I believe this team can extend our long-term track record of outperformance, and I believe this is the team that can and will lead the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy. Thank you for your continued support of our company, and I'd now look forward to taking your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you and John, Kirk, congrats on your new roles.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you.\nKirk Crews: Thank you, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: So \u2013 you bet. Kirk, just the AD CVD is obviously an important issue and you made some really interesting comments here. So my questions are going to focus on that. The comment about the tariffs not being known if they decided to go that route till 2025, that would seem to be incredibly disruptive to the sector. So just \u2013 could you just talk about like how that process works and why to actually set the tariffs to better understand why it would be that long?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, Steve, let me go ahead and take that. This is John speaking. That's one of the things that we're pointing out to the Commerce Department is that when they established tariffs, say they come up with a final determination of January of 2023, their practice has always been to impose the tariffs and calculate the actual amounts and release those two years later. So those tariffs would not be known until the first quarter of 2025. And so, what the industry would be forced to do perversely is actually go back and buy panels from China because the tariffs in China are known. And China is the only country in the world that would have panels available to sell because, as we said in our remarks, the U.S. panel manufacturing industry, which is incredibly small, again, even at full capacity it only has the ability to satisfy 10% to 20% of the entire U.S. demand. The U.S. industry is sold out until 2025. And if you don't know what the tariff rates are in Southeast Asia, it forces you back to China where the tariffs are known and have been known for the last 10 years, which is an absolutely perverse outcome, an outrageous outcome, quite frankly, and one we intend to make sure that the Commerce Department clearly understands because that's an unintended consequence that I don't think anybody wants. And the other point that goes along with it is if we're trying to be tough on trade, we're not. China is not the one that pays the price. Who pays the price here are American companies, American workers, the American consumer that pays higher electricity costs than they ever have before in a rapidly increasing natural gas price environment, oil prices, coal prices. Solar is actually deflationary. And you actually reward the Chinese, who then get to sell panels at the inflated rate. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. When you look at our company and our business, we are in, I think, a different position than the rest of the industry is. While all those things are not good for the industry, I think our company is in a position to be able to manage these risks fortunately. We have strong contracts in place. We do have a global supply chain and sourcing capability that gives us options that others don't. But back to the strength of our contracts, I think that that gives us the ability that others might not have to continue sourcing from our existing supply base even in South Korea without \u2013 or I mean in Southeast Asia without those tariff amounts being fully known. But the problem that this creates with that two year delay into 2025, if build back better doesn't get passed or some form of reconciliation, you're also on the ITC clock that is expiring over that same period of time. So you have to have an ability to go source those panels, find them someplace else to get your projects built. Again, we're confident in our ability to be able to do that just given the strength of our contracts that's why \u2013 and we're also optimistic that the outcome here is so outrageous and so ludicrous that the Commerce Department won't possibly, based on their four prior rulings over the last decade, 2012, 2014, 2020 and in 2021, where this exact question has been asked and answered by three separate administrations, including this one, how can you possibly pull the rug out from under the industry, makes absolutely no sense to force business back to China, which is what you were trying to prevent in the first place.\nSteve Fleishman: That's super helpful. Just a couple quick follow-ups on the same issue, which is, first, given everything you said, why did they initiate this in the first place? Did they not understand the implications? Second, are you seeing any better movement as a result of what's already happened to build back better? And then the last one is just in that worst-case event that we have to wait till 2025 to work this out and you reiterated back a month ago that even with this review confidence in the high end of the target, does that include that scenario?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. Let me take those in order. So, first of all, why did they take the investigation? You saw what happened in October. They had a similar filing that was made around circumvention, the same Department of Commerce decided not to take that up in the same year that the rule that making cells and panels outside of China was okay. Here in 2022, I think, they looked at it and said okay, well, this is the second one in a row. Let's take on the investigation. We don't think the investigation itself if we just do a little bit more fact-finding will actually have an impact on the industry. They were wrong. It does. We told them it would. And you can see it in our own portfolio at 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts potentially being moved into 2023. Luckily, we have enough cushion and enough other things that we can do or doesn't impact our financial expectations that movement. Other companies in the industry are not that fortunate. And so, our hope is that they look at the information. We don't think the information has changed. And they rely on the prior four decisions from 2012, 2014, 2020 and 2021 to follow a consistent trade practice rather than retroactively changing the rules for an industry that has been playing by the rules for the last decade, that would make absolutely no sense in an environment where you have inflation, increasing commodity prices and the only deflationary product and source of generation that also achieves clean energy goals and creates a ton of American jobs. You\u2019re stymieing rather than helping. So that\u2019s the rationale. The second question I think you had was on, where are we on BBB? So look, if you\u2019re really looking at \u2013 if you look at BBA \u2013 BBB in the current environment now is the time to move forward on it like no other. Given the inflationary pressures on energy prices now is the time to double down on renewables. Now is the time to create real manufacturing incentives if you want to re-domesticate the supply chain to the U.S., which is really, really small right now. And if you want to create those manufacturing incentives, do it with a carrot rather than a stick. So we can achieve our clean energy goals over time. So that gives us some optimism, number one, going in. Second, I think there\u2019s motivation going into the midterms to get our energy policy, right, particularly our clean energy policy, right. And I think the Democrats do need a win going into these midterms, the structure is much the same. So there wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not contemplating a large chain of structure, both sides are talking. I think for the first time in a while we have the Supreme Court nomination behind us. Time is, something we got to work with the reconciliation for this year expires at the end of September. So we\u2019ve really got to try to get something moving forward before the August resource or recess, but remain optimistic that we will be able to get that moving forward. And if it does a much skinnier down package that I would expect to look like a focus really just on climate and clean energy and prescription drugs. And that would be I think, a smaller package that that might be able to move forward. But I think at the same time, there\u2019s going to have to be some open mindedness from the progresses, which I think we are seeing, Senator Manchin made no secret that we need pipeline infrastructure in this country projects like MVP, for example, in more of an, all of the above approach to tackling this issue. And I think there is a rational outcome there that would make sense for all parties involved. And then I think your last question was if we have to wait until 2025, what\u2019s the impact on our long-term expectations. Again, we have strong contracts, we have a global supply chain capability, we would not, based on what we know today expect any changes to our long-term financial expectations.\nSteve Fleishman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time and congrats again on the promotions here guys.\nJohn Ketchum: Good morning, Julian.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. So I just want to come back to the earnings impact on you guys. I certainly appreciate the macro that you guys have described here. But can you speak more specifically to the earnings offsets, not just in 2022, but especially 2023 and 2024, given that the timing of these renewable and services tends to impact the subsequent year more so? And then if I\u2019m hearing you right, again, I know you keep talking about Chinese imports, but is that the answer here in lieu of having clarity effectively, and this is a matter of timing and pivoting into a Chinese supply solution in some form or another, or at least creating your own domestic supply rapidly. Just clearly, we\u2019re not going to sit here until 2025. Just want to get some understanding as to what the earnings mitigation is in the near term and what that answer is in 2023, 2024?\nJohn Ketchum: Julien, thank you for the question. In terms of the way we\u2019re thinking about being able to manage this and continue to still have the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted earnings expectations and reiterate that we would be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at near the high end of the range. Look, we are a very large company with a diverse set of growth drivers. FPL is performing really well. We have great visibility into the next four years with the settlement agreement. We run the business with a lot of financial discipline and build a conservative financial plan. We \u2013 as we discussed today continue to find ways to run the business more efficiently and have identified through the project velocity over $400 million of run rate savings that we expect to be able to receive over the next few years. When we add all that up and particularly think about how conservatively we are with the way we structure our plan. We feel very comfortable and being able to continue to deliver on our financial expectations. Yes. And then Julian, I\u2019ll take the last piece on the \u2013 I think what I understood your question to be on the supply chain. So that\u2019s the other reason why we don\u2019t think any action is required by the department of commerce today because the supply chain is already changing for the entire industry. Polysilicon is now being sourced out to Germany. It\u2019s being sourced out to the United States. Suppliers are quickly becoming more vertically integrated and moving their ingot and wafer producing capabilities outside of China, where cells and modules are already made. And that will be a sourcing strategy that will be followed by us and much of the industry going forward, including I think by the U.S., the so-called U.S. panel manufacturers one \u2013 because one thing I want to make sure people understand. As I said before at full capacity, the U.S. panel manufacturers can satisfy only 10% to 20% of U.S. demand, but when they make panels in the U.S., they\u2019re not really making panels in the U.S. They\u2019re importing all of the products that go into a panel from outside the U.S., mainly from the Southeast Asian countries. And they have these small assembly shops in the U.S. that employ a few hundred people that go ahead and just put it together. And then they stamp the panel made in the USA when it really isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s one of the frustrating things that we\u2019re tackling here, but we are \u2013 again, as I said, moving the supply chain outside of China and the U.S. panel manufacturers I assume will be looking at some more things for their continued reliance on imports as they think about their strategy going forward as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But just on your earnings impact, it sounds like this is about accelerating velocity, basically accelerating cost savings into the near term to offset some of the impacts as well as maybe some FPL drivers, rather than saying we\u2019re going to do more wind versus what the plan is kind of a near-term sense. And actually, if you can speak to the FPL piece, just on CapEx changes versus the 10-K. It seems like the range is a little bit lower. But again, I\u2019ll let you respond holistically.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. So on the first piece of your question, cost savings is one piece of it. We have cushion in our plan. We run the business very conservatively. We have cushion in the plan. We expect to be okay. Kirk, I\u2019ll let you take the FPL question.\nKirk Crews: Sure. Julien, as we\u2019ve thought about the CapEx plan at FPL, as we discussed on the call today, the expectation is \u2013 for this year is roughly $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion of capital that we plan to deploy. We also laid out in the discussion around the 10-year site plan what we\u2019re thinking in terms of solar that we\u2019re going to add to the system. We feel very good about the capital program that we have at FPL over the next four years in not just generation, but as well as T&D infrastructure, hardening and undergrounding. So, we have a very good plan there at FPL. Also, I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind with respect to FPL, as we discussed on \u2013 in the prepared remarks as well, we are continuing to see just significant growth at FPL, organic growth, in terms of people coming to Florida. At 91,000 additional customers added in roughly four or five years, we\u2019re going to add the size of Gulf to the system, and that\u2019s going to continue to provide us with CapEx opportunities as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may now go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey good morning guys. Good morning Kirk, John.\nKirk Crews: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Just on the near \u2013 the 2023-2024 signed contracts. I mean, obviously, they\u2019re up 11 gigs, so you\u2019re getting close to the target range for those years, which could allude obviously you guys delivering within your plan. But I just \u2013 I want to get a little bit of a sense here. If the tail risks are longer dated, right, could we see more projects shifts than what you kind of disclosed in the footnote maybe into 2024 and beyond? And if so, is there a point in time, John, you start shifting into more wind from solar and storage? I mean, obviously, wind is very competitive. The returns aren\u2019t great, but I would think several players are going to follow in similar footsteps there. So, I guess, how to think about the profile of the backlog if this is more longer dated and we don\u2019t get visibility?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. Shar, I\u2019ll take that. So the first point that I would make is that this is good for the wind business. I think you could see that from the results of our origination activity this quarter. So even to the extent we might see some shifting solar from 2022 to 2023 or 2023 to 2024, wind is coming online even faster. And remember, the development cycle for wind and the origination activity for wind is much shorter. We can originate a wind project and have it built in 10 months. And so to the extent you might see some solar activity drop off \u2013 and really, again, I view this as a 2022 and 2023 issue. The beauty of it is, you have wind to step in and gets placed. And that\u2019s an area where we have significant competitive advantages. And being able to sell 23 wind at a 80% PTC, we can be extremely competitive in the pricing there and in the offering. And it provides us with, I think, a mitigation measure on top of the strong supplier contracts that we already have on the solar side that others in the industry don\u2019t have. It\u2019s great to have a diversified business to be able to fall back on, and that\u2019s why we feel good about our financial expectations.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then, John, just maybe just shifting to FPL. I mean you guys put out plans for additional winterization resiliency, 3,200 megawatts of new storage through to 2031. The solar programs are kind of well defined. And I know we talked about potential delays on the NEER side. But do you see opportunities conversely to maybe accelerate some of that solar CapEx on the regulated side, especially as gas costs have put a lot of pressure on affordability and certainly help from an LCOE comparability? So could we see faster maybe solar deployment on the regulated side to reduce what you\u2019re seeing in the commodity curves?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. I think, first of all, I want to say the CapEx is actually up at FPL, just back to \u2013 I think it was Julien\u2019s earlier question. Undergrounding is a piece of that. It\u2019s really important we get our undergrounding in service on time and on budget. We continue to look to ways to shift that to the left. And look, as we are in an increasing natural gas price environment, the right answer for Florida customers certainly is to evaluate and look at trying to get more renewables online in Florida faster. It\u2019s a hedge against rising natural gas prices in the state. And it\u2019s a hedge for the country, which is another reason why, as I\u2019ve said a couple of times already, what\u2019s happening is quite silly.\nShar Pourreza: Got it.\nEric Silagy: The only \u2013 this is Eric Silagy. The only thing I would add is the 10-year site plan we just filed, a pretty good road map of the future opportunities. We are going to be adding a lot more solar into the system, pending the PSC\u2019s approval. And demand for solar together continues to remain very, very strong. And so we\u2019re going to be continuing to look at the next round for SolarTogether after the current one we just filed for. So there\u2019s going to be additional opportunities. But again, this is about smartly deploying capital and doing the right thing for customers for the long term.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And Eric, that \u2013 those opportunities could be incremental, right, to the current plan?\nEric Silagy: Absolutely.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just really lastly, and it's unrelated to what we're talking about. But John, just on the JA case again, the federal case against a couple of executives. I know NextEra and FPL were subpoenaed. Is there any details you can provide there? Because we do get some questions on that from time-to-time.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. Let me just give a little bit of background there. We were asked a while back to provide some documentation in connection with that matter, which we did. We cooperated in full. We were told and have been told we are not a target of the investigation. And I think the article you're referring to, the reporter just got it flat out wrong. We have not been subpoenaed as a witness in that matter.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Great. That's what I wanted to clarify. Congrats, John and Kirk on the promotions.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you.\nKirk Crews: Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. You may now go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning team and thank you for squeezing me in and taking my question here. Just maybe\u2026\nKirk Crews: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Kirk. Just may be, can I just a little bit more granular on the \u2013 as you get towards the sort of the preliminary ruling here in late August on the solar panel investigation? What are the key steps that we should be watching for? And what is your and other industry sort of players' involvement going to be in that process?\nKirk Crews: So the way to think about the process is right now, the DoC has provided questionnaires to different groups. Those questionnaires are being completed. I believe they're due this week for some. I believe others had requested some excisions and maybe have been granted. Once they have all that information, then the groups that are \u2013 that have standing are also allowed to weigh in on the matter. We do have standing in the case. So we will be weighing in on this as well. And then the DoC has all that information and reviews \u2013 essentially reviews the data and then reaches their preliminary determination, which is expected to happen by late August.\nDurgesh Chopra: All right thank you, Kirk and then maybe just one quick one and see if you'll give this information. If not, that's okay because it's small. But can you maybe talk about the gas transaction \u2013 the gas pipeline sale? And what kind of multiple and EBITDA contribution? I know it's small. So I don't know if you can share that information. I'll just follow up with IR.\nKirk Crews: Yes. We're not going to share that information at this time. I understand the reason for the question. I would just say, as we included in the press release and in the script, it was a very attractive and accretive EBITDA multiple. We're very happy with it.\nDurgesh Chopra: Perfect. Thank you so much guys. Appreciate the time.\nKirk Crews: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nDave Arcaro: Hi. It's Dave Arcaro on for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit to PPA pricing that you're seeing for new contracts, I guess, across wind, solar and storage. Is there an approximate level that you would expect PPA prices to have to rise to absorb some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen? And at the end of the day, do you expect that to happen? Do you think they'll rise enough that you can protect your returns on incrementally new signed renewables contracts?\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. This is Rebecca and I'll take that question. It's a matter of practice, what we do with our customers and as we're approaching the market is factor in whatever the current latest pricing is, which is certainly what we're doing now in terms of where we think the market is in terms of our cost as well as what the alternatives are for our customers. So keep in mind that, as we've talked about, some pricing pressure, whether it's consistent with the comments that Kirk and John have talked about on the solar side or on the wind side that it's against the backdrop of costs that have gone up, other alternative costs that have also gone up, whether it's oil or natural gas, overall power prices in the marketplace. And so there is still a significant incentive for our customers to procure renewable energy. And of course, as you've seen from our signed contracts for this quarter, the demand for wind has been really strong, both in terms of signed contracts and I'll also tell you in terms of our ongoing conversations with customers. And customers are also still very interested in pursuing solar projects. A lot of folks were caught off guard by this decision, surprised for all the reasons that John and Kirk highlighted that the Department of Commerce would have taken this step. And all of us would like to see the uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible and as favorably as possible, so that our customers can move forward with deploying solar. We'll talk more about where we see the market in terms of pricing and specifically pricing versus the alternatives at the investor conference. But again, the key takeaway from my perspective is they remain very attractive for customers.\nDave Arcaro: Great. Thanks. That's helpful color. And I was just wondering, just on the pace of new signings has that slowed down significantly since this investigation started? And would the preliminary determination potentially be a bit of a relief valve? Or could it take longer than that to start to maybe kick start the project signings again?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes. I'm always cautious to say anything about a given quarter's signings because I think sometimes there's too much weight put on them, sometimes too little. But as of kind of an obvious point, contract signings were terrific this quarter. And I'm really proud of the execution of the team, and it very much reflects a lot of interest from customers that has not waned at all. So we're very excited about the opportunities. Nothing has changed in terms of long-term view about excitement for renewables. They remain very attractive. And as John highlighted, they should be deflationary. Absent this uncertainty and relative to the alternatives, this is a great option for customers, and we couldn't be more excited about the future.\nDave Arcaro: Great, appreciate that and thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thank you, Jessica, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong first quarter results and is off to a solid start to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 10.4% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of our underlying businesses. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in its sector of Fortune Magazine's world's most admired companies list for the 15th time in 16 years. Our culture of commitment to excellence in everything we do and our core values are what allow our team of approximately 15,000 employees to continue delivering best-in-class value to our customers and shareholders while helping build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. FPL increased net income by approximately $98 million from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter, FPL successfully placed in-service, approximately 450 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects that are recovered through base rates as part of its new four year settlement agreement, which as a reminder became effective on January 1st of this year. As a result, FPL has now completed on time and within budget all of its planned solar build with 2022 in service dates. FPL now owns and operates more than 3,600 megawatts of solar, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. FPL's modernization investments since 2001 have saved customers more than $12 billion in fuel costs and its customers have benefited from a 45% improvement in reliability over the last decade. FPL's other major capital investments are progressing well, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection and the highly efficient approximately 1,200 megawatts Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, both of which are scheduled for completion later this year. By executing on smart capital investments such as these and running the business efficiently, FPL continues to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by nearly 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable performance in our existing wind portfolio. In terms of new origination, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of renewables and storage origination adding approximately 1,770 net megawatts to our backlog since the last call bringing our backlog total to approximately 17,700 megawatts. Included in the additions this quarter is approximately 1,200 net megawatts of wind projects, which is the second largest quarter of wind origination in our history. In the midst of inflationary pressures and uncertainty in solar supply chain, which I will discuss further in a few moments, our continued origination success in this environment is a testament to the strength of Energy Resources' competitive advantages and the ongoing demand from our customers for low cost renewals and storage. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our team's execution and progress at both FPL and Energy Resources. Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2022, FPL reported net income of $875 million, or $0.44 per share, an increase of $0.05 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.3% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2022 capital investments at FPL to be between $7.9 billion and $8.3 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2022. Under our rate agreement, we record reserve amortization entries to achieve a predetermined regulatory ROE for each trailing 12 month period. In this case, the 11.6% that I previously mentioned. While we initially expected to earn below our targeted ROE in the early part of 2022, a combination of warm weather, operational efficiencies and outstanding execution by the team resulted in us achieving our targeted 11.6% ROE while using $124 million of reserve amortization available under our current settlement agreement during the first quarter. Turning to our development and planning efforts, FPL recently filed its Annual Ten-Year Site Plan that presents our recommended generation resource plan through 2031. The recommended Ten-Year Site Plan includes roughly 9,500 megawatts of new solar capacity across our service territory over the next ten years, which would result in nearly 20% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2031 coming from solar generation. This planned solar build-out includes nearly 1,200 megawatts of base rate solar projects inclusive of the approximately 450 megawatts placed in service during the first quarter that we plan to build over the next two years. In addition, it includes approximately 1,800 megawatts under the SoBRA mechanism of our settlement agreement, approximately 1,800 megawatts of SolarTogether community solar projects that we expect to construct over the next four years, as well as roughly 4,700 megawatts of additional solar after 2025, that is subject to approval by the Florida Public Service Commission. FPL continues to deliver what is one of the largest-ever solar expansions in the U.S. Compared to current levels, the recommended plan projects an approximately 65% increase in zero-carbon-emissions electricity produced by the FPL system over the next decade, largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan, which we now expect to complete by 2025, and the solar additions that I previously mentioned. This projected increase in zero carbon-emissions generation is significant for a utility system of our size, especially when considering that our total amount of energy delivered in 2031 is expected to be nearly 10 percentage points higher through customer growth and increased adoption of electric vehicles. Our green hydrogen pilot program plans are also reiterated in the site plan. As we've previously discussed, we intend to build an approximately 25-megawatt electrolysis system at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center that will be powered entirely by solar energy from a nearby site. The pilot is designed to test, in practice, the concept of replacing natural gas with green hydrogen as fuel for combined cycle unit use. The pilot project is expected to guide the way for future use of hydrogen as a fuel source across FPL's fleet of highly efficient combined cycle units, thus lowering or eliminating carbon emissions from FPL's fleet in the future. This pilot project is projected to go into service in late 2023. Notably, our as-filed 10-year site plan recommends a total expected deployment of approximately 3,200 megawatts of new battery storage capacity by 2031. Included in this total is approximately 1,400 megawatts of incremental battery storage to enhance readiness and reliability for our customers during potential extreme weather events. We also plan to make other smart capital investments for winterization efforts designed to support potential increased customer load during extreme winter temperature conditions, while also providing additional day-to-day reliability benefits for customers. A hallmark of our culture is taking every opportunity to learn from events that happen in our industry, not just those that directly affect FPL, to ensure we continue to deliver the best possible value to our customers. Our planned targeted investments for winterization were identified as a result of our detailed assessment of our fleet following Winter Storm Uri last year that affected Texas and much of the South. We will provide additional detail on these programs and our other capital initiatives at our June investor conference. The Florida economy remains healthy and Florida's population continues to grow at one of the fastest rates in the U.S. Florida's job market continues to show healthy results, with more than 700,000 new private sector jobs added over the last year, and Florida's labor force participation rate is up nearly 2% year-over-year. Other positive economic data across the state include the continued strength of Florida's real estate market, with the three-month moving average for new housing permits up nearly 20% year-over-year. FPL's average number of customers increased by more than 91,000, or 1.6%, versus the comparable prior-year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales increased 2.6% from the prior-year comparable period, and we estimate that approximately 0.7% of this increase can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.9%, with strong continued customer growth contributing favorably. Energy Resources reported a first quarter 2022 GAAP loss of approximately $1.5 billion, or $0.76 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $628 million, or $0.32 per share, up $0.02 versus the prior-year comparable period. The effect of the mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources' first quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. As a reminder, this quarter's GAAP results were also impacted by the write-off of our remaining investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. Contributions from new investments were roughly flat year-over-year, while our existing generation and storage assets added $0.05 per share due to favorable wind resource and the absence of Winter Storm Uri impacts. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business decreased by $0.02 per share and NextEra Energy Transmission increased results by $0.01 per share year-over-year. The comparative contribution from our gas infrastructure business decreased results by $0.02 per share following favorable performance in the first quarter of last year during Winter Storm Uri. All other impacts were roughly flat versus 2021. As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination, which is reflective of our ability to continue leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver clean energy solutions to meet the ongoing market demand for renewables. Since the last call, we added approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new wind projects for 2022, 2023 and 2024 commercial operations dates to our backlog. Our backlog additions also include approximately 440 megawatts of solar projects and approximately 130 megawatts of battery storage projects. With more than 2.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have now signed more than 85% of the megawatts needed to realize the midpoint of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a review of an anti-dumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from four Southeast Asian countries, which in recent years sourced over 80% of all solar panel imports into the United States. As we recently highlighted, we are disappointed by the Commerce Department's decision to conduct this investigation. We believe the Commerce Department already settled this issue when it concluded in 2012 that the process of converting solar wafers into electricity-producing solar cells is technologically sophisticated and the most capital intensive part of the solar panel manufacturing process, and when that occurs outside of China, the cells are not subject to the 2012 anti-dumping and countervailing duties applicable to Chinese solar cell imports. The Commerce Department's later rulings in 2014, 2020 and 2021 are consistent with this and have been relied upon by the solar industry as it continued to invest billions of dollars in new solar generating facilities in the United States over this period. In light of these four prior rulings, the reliance on them by the industry and the substantial, technologically sophisticated processing that occurs in the Southeast Asian countries, we believe it will be difficult for the Commerce Department to conclude under its circumvention standards that circumvention of the 2012 tariffs is actually occurring. If the Commerce Department were to find circumvention in the current investigation, we believe it would be unwinding a decade of consistent trade practice across the past three administrations, including the current administration just last year. We believe such a decision would create significant price uncertainty as additional tariffs on panels from the four Southeast Asian countries would likely remain unknown until close to 2025, as final tariff amounts are not determined for about two years after the year of importation. This price uncertainty would likely result in the unintended consequence of U.S. solar panel supply once again being sourced significantly from China, because the tariffs applicable to imports from China are more certain based on 10 years of assessed duty history. U.S. solar panel assemblers are, for the most part, sold out of solar panels through 2024 and, even at full capacity, are only capable of serving 10% to 20% of the U.S. solar panel demand in the first place. It should also be noted that nearly all of the large domestic solar panel assemblers in the U.S. do not support the efforts behind the circumvention claim or the Commerce Department's decision to investigate, as they also primarily rely on imported cells from Southeast Asia to produce their panels in the United States. And all of the uncertainty from the investigation is occurring at a time when natural gas, coal and oil prices have increased dramatically, leaving solar and storage as one of the few ways to alleviate inflationary pressures on electricity prices. For these reasons, among others, we are optimistic that the investigation will ultimately be resolved favorably and the Commerce Department will conclude not to impose additional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on cells and panels sourced from these Southeast Asian countries. We believe that NextEra Energy is as well positioned as any company in the industry to manage these issues. However, given that a number of suppliers are not expected to ship panels to the U.S. until the Commerce Department makes a preliminary determination as late as August, we continue to expect some of our solar and storage projects may be adversely impacted by this delay. We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to assess the potential impacts of this investigation and are optimistic about our ability to arrive at acceptable mitigation measures. Based on what we know today, we believe that approximately 2.1 gigawatts to 2.8 gigawatts of our expected 2022 solar and storage build may shift from 2022 to 2023. Despite the delay, given our competitive advantages, including the strength of our supplier relationships and contracts, we remain comfortable with our current development expectations for wind, solar and storage, which are to build roughly 23 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts over the four-year period from 2021 through the end of 2024. We run a diversified business at Energy Resources that includes multiple renewable energy technologies and provides a natural hedge against temporary disruptions like the one our industry is currently experiencing. In fact, in light of the uncertainty in the solar supply chain, we believe renewable demand will likely temporarily shift in part from solar to wind, and we believe Energy Resources has terrific competitive advantages in wind development. The accompanying slide provides additional details. Finally, during the quarter NextEra Energy Transmission, along with its partners, completed the construction of the East-West Tie Transmission Line Project. The 450-kilometer, 230-kilovolt transmission line runs from Wawa to Thunder Bay, Ontario and is expected to address long-standing regional transmission constraints, thereby increasing much-needed access to energy to support new economic growth in the region for years to come. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy, for the first quarter of 2022, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $415 [ph] million, or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy's 2022 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.46 billion and $0.74 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from the Corporate & Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended earlier this year through 2025 remain unchanged. For 2022, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.75 to $2.85. For 2023 through 2025, NextEra Energy expects to grow roughly 6% to 8% off the expected 2022 adjusted earnings per share range. NextEra Energy is in a strong position to meet its financial expectations through 2025, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings expectations ranges in each of 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. A big part of NextEra Energy's culture is a focus on continuous improvement and productivity. To that end, we are currently wrapping up our company-wide productivity initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. Project Velocity built upon the success of Project Momentum and Project Accelerate, which were launched in 2013 and 2017, respectively. The employee-generated ideas implemented through Project Momentum and Project Accelerate are projected to deliver more than $1.8 billion in average annual run-rate savings first, our cost projections just 10 years ago. In fact, the ideas generated this year in Project Velocity alone are expected to reach roughly $400 million in additional run-rate efficiencies in the next few years, representing the largest identified O&M cost savings in the history of these programs. This result is another example of the strength of our culture and team and highlights our continued focus on productivity and our team's willingness to embrace innovation and leverage technology. From 2021 to 2025, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered solid first quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA of more than 16% driven primarily by contributions from the approximately 2,400 net megawatts of renewables and storage added during 2021. Yesterday, the NEP Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.7325 per common unit, or $2.93 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distributions per unit by more than 290% since the IPO. Further building upon that strength, NextEra Energy Partners today is announcing that it has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 67% interest in an approximately 230-megawatt, four-hour battery storage facility in California that is fully contracted with an investment grade counterparty for 15 years. The acquisition will further diversify NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio with the addition of another battery storage project and is an excellent complement to NextEra Energy Partners' existing operations. NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the project interest for approximately $191 million, subject to closing adjustments, which is expected to be funded with existing debt capacity. NextEra Energy Partners' share of the asset's tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $80 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $30 million to $35 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $13 million to $18 million, each on a five-year average annual run-rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. The transaction is expected to close later this year, upon the project reaching its commercial operations date, and supports NextEra Energy Partners' projected adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution growth in 2022. Finally, NextEra Energy Partners recently closed on a transaction to sell an approximately 156-mile gas pipeline from its existing portfolio for a total consideration of approximately $203 million to a third party. The sale price of the pipeline represents an attractive and accretive EBITDA multiple and further enhances the renewable energy profile of NextEra Energy Partners. We are pleased with this transaction and look forward to redeploying the proceeds into accretive renewable energy assets, like the battery storage acquisition from Energy Resources that I just mentioned, to support NextEra Energy Partners' long-term distribution growth expectations. Turning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners' first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $412 million and cash available for distribution was $169 million. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed in the second half of 2021, contributed approximately $75 million of adjusted EBITDA and $25 million of cash available for distribution. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution existing projects declined $9 million and $29 million respectively, versus the prior year comparable quarter. Favorable performance at existing projects drove an increase in adjusted EBITDA contributions of approximately $46 million year-over-year, which was more than offset by the absence of approximately $55 million in benefits realized during the last February's Winter Storm Uri. Excluding the positive impact of Winter Storm Uri from last year's first quarter results, this quarter's adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were up nearly 38% and 31%, respectively, year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was also impacted by the timing of PAYGO payments. Wind resource for the first quarter of 2022 was 108% of the long-term average versus 98% in the first quarter of 2021. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2022, to be in the ranges of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and $675 million to $765 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2022 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2022 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We do not expect the recent solar supply chain disruption to impact our ability to deliver on these expectations. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February of 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low-80% range. In summary, both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are benefiting from our history of strong execution that has positioned us well to capitalize on the terrific growth opportunities available to us across our businesses. We look forward to sharing more detail with you on our growth plans for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners at our investor conference in New York on June 14. Before taking your questions, I'd like to turn the call over to John Ketchum. Thank you, Steve. Sure. Julien, as we've thought about the CapEx plan at FPL, as we discussed on the call today, the expectation is \u2013 for this year is roughly $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion of capital that we plan to deploy. We also laid out in the discussion around the 10-year site plan what we're thinking in terms of solar that we're going to add to the system. We feel very good about the capital program that we have at FPL over the next four years in not just generation, but as well as T&D infrastructure, hardening and undergrounding. So, we have a very good plan there at FPL. Also, I think it's important to keep in mind with respect to FPL, as we discussed on \u2013 in the prepared remarks as well, we are continuing to see just significant growth at FPL, organic growth, in terms of people coming to Florida. At 91,000 additional customers added in roughly four or five years, we're going to add the size of Gulf to the system, and that's going to continue to provide us with CapEx opportunities as well. Good morning. Thanks, Shar. Good morning. So the way to think about the process is right now, the DoC has provided questionnaires to different groups. Those questionnaires are being completed. I believe they're due this week for some. I believe others had requested some excisions and maybe have been granted. Once they have all that information, then the groups that are \u2013 that have standing are also allowed to weigh in on the matter. We do have standing in the case. So we will be weighing in on this as well. And then the DoC has all that information and reviews \u2013 essentially reviews the data and then reaches their preliminary determination, which is expected to happen by late August. Yes. We're not going to share that information at this time. I understand the reason for the question. I would just say, as we included in the press release and in the script, it was a very attractive and accretive EBITDA multiple. We're very happy with it. Thank you."

            "content": "The only \u2013 this is Eric Silagy. The only thing I would add is the 10-year site plan we just filed, a pretty good road map of the future opportunities. We are going to be adding a lot more solar into the system, pending the PSC's approval. And demand for solar together continues to remain very, very strong. And so we're going to be continuing to look at the next round for SolarTogether after the current one we just filed for. So there's going to be additional opportunities. But again, this is about smartly deploying capital and doing the right thing for customers for the long term. Absolutely."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Sure. This is Rebecca and I'll take that question. It's a matter of practice, what we do with our customers and as we're approaching the market is factor in whatever the current latest pricing is, which is certainly what we're doing now in terms of where we think the market is in terms of our cost as well as what the alternatives are for our customers. So keep in mind that, as we've talked about, some pricing pressure, whether it's consistent with the comments that Kirk and John have talked about on the solar side or on the wind side that it's against the backdrop of costs that have gone up, other alternative costs that have also gone up, whether it's oil or natural gas, overall power prices in the marketplace. And so there is still a significant incentive for our customers to procure renewable energy. And of course, as you've seen from our signed contracts for this quarter, the demand for wind has been really strong, both in terms of signed contracts and I'll also tell you in terms of our ongoing conversations with customers. And customers are also still very interested in pursuing solar projects. A lot of folks were caught off guard by this decision, surprised for all the reasons that John and Kirk highlighted that the Department of Commerce would have taken this step. And all of us would like to see the uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible and as favorably as possible, so that our customers can move forward with deploying solar. We'll talk more about where we see the market in terms of pricing and specifically pricing versus the alternatives at the investor conference. But again, the key takeaway from my perspective is they remain very attractive for customers. Yes. I'm always cautious to say anything about a given quarter's signings because I think sometimes there's too much weight put on them, sometimes too little. But as of kind of an obvious point, contract signings were terrific this quarter. And I'm really proud of the execution of the team, and it very much reflects a lot of interest from customers that has not waned at all. So we're very excited about the opportunities. Nothing has changed in terms of long-term view about excitement for renewables. They remain very attractive. And as John highlighted, they should be deflationary. Absent this uncertainty and relative to the alternatives, this is a great option for customers, and we couldn't be more excited about the future."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thank you, Kirk, and good morning, everyone. I am excited for the opportunity to talk to you in my new role. Since we announced our planned leadership succession in January, we have heard from many of our shareholders and industry analysts. Several of you have asked whether you should expect any changes in strategy under a new CEO. The short answer is that I expect our strategy to be consistent with how we have grown the company over the past several decades, but that we will continue to adapt and evolve our strategy to meet increasing customer expectations, to leverage new technologies and to lead the decarbonization of the U.S. economy. Now is the time for our company, our industry and our country to embrace low-cost renewable energy like never before. We need to create more jobs, not less, and combat the impacts of higher inflation, higher oil and natural gas prices and rising electricity demand by supporting, not stymying, solar and storage development. Our strategy going forward is to build down on our core businesses. At FPL, we expect one of the highest population growth rates of any state in the nation to continue. In fact, at our current rate of organic customer growth, FPL would add a customer base the size of Gulf Power roughly every five years. FPL's undergrounding program is just getting started, and we have visibility to billions of dollars in capital investment for the next several decades to continue hardening and strengthening the grid as we deliver industry-leading reliability to our customers. And we are also just getting started at decarbonizing the generation fleet at FPL as only about 5% of our generation in FPL is currently produced by renewable energy. I believe that FPL already is the best utility in the nation. And yet we see significant cost reduction and incremental capital investment opportunities at FPL over the next several decades that can further improve our industry-leading customer value proposition by delivering clean, low-cost energy solutions for Florida customers. Our strategy also entails doubling down on our core at Energy Resources. We intend to build more wind, more solar and more battery stores than anybody else in this country year in and year out regardless of the headwinds or tailwinds in any given year. We believe that we have the competitive advantages to win under any market conditions. And with recent technological advancements in green hydrogen and other forms of long-term storage, we see a total addressable market in this country for renewables, storage and transmission of around $8 trillion through 2050. We have said this before, and we believe it is never more true than it is today: the opportunity set for renewable energy in this country continues to expand rapidly, and we believe Energy Resources is in a terrific position for continued industry leadership and for long-term growth for shareholders. Both FPL and Energy Resources have multiple ways to grow, and each business continues to push the other to be even better. As FPL grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in Florida. As Energy Resources grows, both businesses learn what drives customer value in other markets across the country. Operational excellence is a competitive advantage for us across both businesses, so as development and construction expertise, so as supply chain management, so as financial discipline. Both businesses are constantly implementing new technologies. Both businesses are constantly finding ways to do things more efficiently and to improve our cost position. As Kirk mentioned, this year, our employees generated about 900 individual ideas translating into roughly $400 million in additional run rate O&M savings across the enterprise through Project Velocity, our best performance ever after 10 years of pursuing O&M improvement in this employee-driven annual exercise. Our strategy at NextEra Energy is to continue to do what we have done well, only better and bigger as new market opportunities present themselves. Our strategy at NextEra Energy Partners is much the same. The partnership will double down on what we have done well since our IPO in 2014. We expect to continue delivering LP distribution growth that is already best-in-class. We plan to continue to pursue growth in three ways: by acquiring assets from Energy Resources, by acquiring assets from third parties and by additional organic capital investments in the assets we own as the portfolio grows over time. Yet as at NextEra Energy, it is the future of the partnership and its long-term growth visibility that is most exciting to us. Simply put, we believe that what is good for NextEra Energy tends to be good for NextEra Energy Partners, and what is good for decarbonization of the U.S. economy is going to be terrific for shareholders of NextEra Energy as well as for unitholders of NextEra Energy Partners. We will have more to share about our long-term growth prospects at both companies at our investor conference in June. I'd like to close by once again thanking our team. In addition to the 900 Project Velocity ideas I mentioned earlier, last week, we held our annual team competition for the Highest Quality and Innovation Award at our company, followed by our Employee Expo in which 56 teams were featured. I can tell you that, as impressive as our track record has been over the last 30-plus years, our future is even brighter. Our team continues to impress with their creativity, analytical abilities, innovation, customer focus and the will to win. I truly believe that we have the best team in the industry. I believe this team can extend our long-term track record of outperformance, and I believe this is the team that can and will lead the decarbonization of the entire U.S. economy. Thank you for your continued support of our company, and I'd now look forward to taking your questions. Thank you. Yes, Steve, let me go ahead and take that. This is John speaking. That's one of the things that we're pointing out to the Commerce Department is that when they established tariffs, say they come up with a final determination of January of 2023, their practice has always been to impose the tariffs and calculate the actual amounts and release those two years later. So those tariffs would not be known until the first quarter of 2025. And so, what the industry would be forced to do perversely is actually go back and buy panels from China because the tariffs in China are known. And China is the only country in the world that would have panels available to sell because, as we said in our remarks, the U.S. panel manufacturing industry, which is incredibly small, again, even at full capacity it only has the ability to satisfy 10% to 20% of the entire U.S. demand. The U.S. industry is sold out until 2025. And if you don't know what the tariff rates are in Southeast Asia, it forces you back to China where the tariffs are known and have been known for the last 10 years, which is an absolutely perverse outcome, an outrageous outcome, quite frankly, and one we intend to make sure that the Commerce Department clearly understands because that's an unintended consequence that I don't think anybody wants. And the other point that goes along with it is if we're trying to be tough on trade, we're not. China is not the one that pays the price. Who pays the price here are American companies, American workers, the American consumer that pays higher electricity costs than they ever have before in a rapidly increasing natural gas price environment, oil prices, coal prices. Solar is actually deflationary. And you actually reward the Chinese, who then get to sell panels at the inflated rate. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. When you look at our company and our business, we are in, I think, a different position than the rest of the industry is. While all those things are not good for the industry, I think our company is in a position to be able to manage these risks fortunately. We have strong contracts in place. We do have a global supply chain and sourcing capability that gives us options that others don't. But back to the strength of our contracts, I think that that gives us the ability that others might not have to continue sourcing from our existing supply base even in South Korea without \u2013 or I mean in Southeast Asia without those tariff amounts being fully known. But the problem that this creates with that two year delay into 2025, if build back better doesn't get passed or some form of reconciliation, you're also on the ITC clock that is expiring over that same period of time. So you have to have an ability to go source those panels, find them someplace else to get your projects built. Again, we're confident in our ability to be able to do that just given the strength of our contracts that's why \u2013 and we're also optimistic that the outcome here is so outrageous and so ludicrous that the Commerce Department won't possibly, based on their four prior rulings over the last decade, 2012, 2014, 2020 and in 2021, where this exact question has been asked and answered by three separate administrations, including this one, how can you possibly pull the rug out from under the industry, makes absolutely no sense to force business back to China, which is what you were trying to prevent in the first place. Yes. Let me take those in order. So, first of all, why did they take the investigation? You saw what happened in October. They had a similar filing that was made around circumvention, the same Department of Commerce decided not to take that up in the same year that the rule that making cells and panels outside of China was okay. Here in 2022, I think, they looked at it and said okay, well, this is the second one in a row. Let's take on the investigation. We don't think the investigation itself if we just do a little bit more fact-finding will actually have an impact on the industry. They were wrong. It does. We told them it would. And you can see it in our own portfolio at 2.1 to 2.8 gigawatts potentially being moved into 2023. Luckily, we have enough cushion and enough other things that we can do or doesn't impact our financial expectations that movement. Other companies in the industry are not that fortunate. And so, our hope is that they look at the information. We don't think the information has changed. And they rely on the prior four decisions from 2012, 2014, 2020 and 2021 to follow a consistent trade practice rather than retroactively changing the rules for an industry that has been playing by the rules for the last decade, that would make absolutely no sense in an environment where you have inflation, increasing commodity prices and the only deflationary product and source of generation that also achieves clean energy goals and creates a ton of American jobs. You're stymieing rather than helping. So that's the rationale. The second question I think you had was on, where are we on BBB? So look, if you're really looking at \u2013 if you look at BBA \u2013 BBB in the current environment now is the time to move forward on it like no other. Given the inflationary pressures on energy prices now is the time to double down on renewables. Now is the time to create real manufacturing incentives if you want to re-domesticate the supply chain to the U.S., which is really, really small right now. And if you want to create those manufacturing incentives, do it with a carrot rather than a stick. So we can achieve our clean energy goals over time. So that gives us some optimism, number one, going in. Second, I think there's motivation going into the midterms to get our energy policy, right, particularly our clean energy policy, right. And I think the Democrats do need a win going into these midterms, the structure is much the same. So there wouldn't \u2013 we're not contemplating a large chain of structure, both sides are talking. I think for the first time in a while we have the Supreme Court nomination behind us. Time is, something we got to work with the reconciliation for this year expires at the end of September. So we've really got to try to get something moving forward before the August resource or recess, but remain optimistic that we will be able to get that moving forward. And if it does a much skinnier down package that I would expect to look like a focus really just on climate and clean energy and prescription drugs. And that would be I think, a smaller package that that might be able to move forward. But I think at the same time, there's going to have to be some open mindedness from the progresses, which I think we are seeing, Senator Manchin made no secret that we need pipeline infrastructure in this country projects like MVP, for example, in more of an, all of the above approach to tackling this issue. And I think there is a rational outcome there that would make sense for all parties involved. And then I think your last question was if we have to wait until 2025, what's the impact on our long-term expectations. Again, we have strong contracts, we have a global supply chain capability, we would not, based on what we know today expect any changes to our long-term financial expectations. Good morning, Julian. Julien, thank you for the question. In terms of the way we're thinking about being able to manage this and continue to still have the confidence to reaffirm our adjusted earnings expectations and reiterate that we would be disappointed if we were not able to deliver financial results at near the high end of the range. Look, we are a very large company with a diverse set of growth drivers. FPL is performing really well. We have great visibility into the next four years with the settlement agreement. We run the business with a lot of financial discipline and build a conservative financial plan. We \u2013 as we discussed today continue to find ways to run the business more efficiently and have identified through the project velocity over $400 million of run rate savings that we expect to be able to receive over the next few years. When we add all that up and particularly think about how conservatively we are with the way we structure our plan. We feel very comfortable and being able to continue to deliver on our financial expectations. Yes. And then Julian, I'll take the last piece on the \u2013 I think what I understood your question to be on the supply chain. So that's the other reason why we don't think any action is required by the department of commerce today because the supply chain is already changing for the entire industry. Polysilicon is now being sourced out to Germany. It's being sourced out to the United States. Suppliers are quickly becoming more vertically integrated and moving their ingot and wafer producing capabilities outside of China, where cells and modules are already made. And that will be a sourcing strategy that will be followed by us and much of the industry going forward, including I think by the U.S., the so-called U.S. panel manufacturers one \u2013 because one thing I want to make sure people understand. As I said before at full capacity, the U.S. panel manufacturers can satisfy only 10% to 20% of U.S. demand, but when they make panels in the U.S., they're not really making panels in the U.S. They're importing all of the products that go into a panel from outside the U.S., mainly from the Southeast Asian countries. And they have these small assembly shops in the U.S. that employ a few hundred people that go ahead and just put it together. And then they stamp the panel made in the USA when it really isn't. And that's one of the frustrating things that we're tackling here, but we are \u2013 again, as I said, moving the supply chain outside of China and the U.S. panel manufacturers I assume will be looking at some more things for their continued reliance on imports as they think about their strategy going forward as well. Yes. So on the first piece of your question, cost savings is one piece of it. We have cushion in our plan. We run the business very conservatively. We have cushion in the plan. We expect to be okay. Kirk, I'll let you take the FPL question. Sure. Shar, I'll take that. So the first point that I would make is that this is good for the wind business. I think you could see that from the results of our origination activity this quarter. So even to the extent we might see some shifting solar from 2022 to 2023 or 2023 to 2024, wind is coming online even faster. And remember, the development cycle for wind and the origination activity for wind is much shorter. We can originate a wind project and have it built in 10 months. And so to the extent you might see some solar activity drop off \u2013 and really, again, I view this as a 2022 and 2023 issue. The beauty of it is, you have wind to step in and gets placed. And that's an area where we have significant competitive advantages. And being able to sell 23 wind at a 80% PTC, we can be extremely competitive in the pricing there and in the offering. And it provides us with, I think, a mitigation measure on top of the strong supplier contracts that we already have on the solar side that others in the industry don't have. It's great to have a diversified business to be able to fall back on, and that's why we feel good about our financial expectations. Yes. I think, first of all, I want to say the CapEx is actually up at FPL, just back to \u2013 I think it was Julien's earlier question. Undergrounding is a piece of that. It's really important we get our undergrounding in service on time and on budget. We continue to look to ways to shift that to the left. And look, as we are in an increasing natural gas price environment, the right answer for Florida customers certainly is to evaluate and look at trying to get more renewables online in Florida faster. It's a hedge against rising natural gas prices in the state. And it's a hedge for the country, which is another reason why, as I've said a couple of times already, what's happening is quite silly. Yes. Let me just give a little bit of background there. We were asked a while back to provide some documentation in connection with that matter, which we did. We cooperated in full. We were told and have been told we are not a target of the investigation. And I think the article you're referring to, the reporter just got it flat out wrong. We have not been subpoenaed as a witness in that matter. Thank you."

NextEra Energy has strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources in 2023. NextEra Energy delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.17, up over 9% from 2022, exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. From solar supply chain challenges to higher inflation and interest rates, NextEra Energy navigated through a challenging environment for the last two years, delivering compound annual adjusted EPS growth of roughly 11.5% since 2021. These were unprecedented events for our sector and clear headwinds for renewables, but disruption often presents opportunity. At NextEra Energy, we relied on our 25 years of renewables experience and our culture of execution to navigate this tough environment. On the strengths of our scale and competitive advantages, our world class supply chain capabilities, customer relationships, access to and cost of capital advantages, the strength of our balance sheet, our data driven development playbook, and our team just to a name few we successfully manage through the disruption. Our scale and competitive advantages served as key differentiators and allowed us to continue to deliver for our customers and extend our long track record of earnings and dividend growth. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 2%. Notwithstanding the strong adjusted EPS results, we recognize and are disappointed by the underperformance in the share price. And as we start 2024, we remain steadfast in our continued focus on execution and creating long-term value for shareholders. We believe that disruption over the last two years has made NextEra Energy an even stronger company. Our business model is more resilient, our development platform is even more advanced, and our supply chain is more diversified than it has ever been. Bottom line, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned headed into 2024. And there is good reason for optimism at NextEra Energy. Although nobody can predict with certainty what 2024 will bring, inflation and interest rates have declined from their peak, and NextEra Energy has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to interest rate volatility through its interest rate hedging program. The Commerce Department has provided the final determination around circumvention, providing solar suppliers with more certainty around the rules and expectations of importing solar equipment. New solar supply chains have been established in the U.S. and internationally, leading to lower solar panel prices, and we see the continued longer-term push towards EVs as being incrementally positive for continued reductions in battery prices. Solar panel and battery prices have already declined by roughly 25% from their peak over the last 24 months, heading into 2024. We have proactively procured critical electrical equipment to complete our renewable projects, securing enough transformers and breakers to cover our expected build through 2027. And due to our scale and construction partnerships, we have not experienced any labor shortages impacting project timelines. Ultimately, all these tailwinds are great for customers, and we believe should drive greater renewables demand in 2024 and beyond, all on the heels of consecutive record years for new renewables originations at Energy Resources in 2022 and 2023, totaling over 17 gigawatts. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically positioned with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL, which represents more than two thirds of our company, is the nation's largest electric utility and continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition and one of the fastest growing states in the US. Energy Resources, the world's renewables leader, has differentiated itself in an industry in which scale, experience, and being well capitalized matters. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we identify investment opportunities that drive value for customers and support Florida's growing economy while keeping bills approximately 30% lower than the national average. We focus on running the business efficiently and continue to lead the industry with the lowest nonfuel O&M per megawatt hour of any large utility in the nation. Our emphasis on modernizing FPL's generation fleet to improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs has saved customers over $15 billion since 2001. We continue this trend in 2023 by placing into service approximately 1, 200 megawatts of cost effective solar and expect to add roughly 4, 800 megawatts over the current rate agreement. And by 2032, we expect to increase FPL's solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15, 000 incremental megawatts. We are also continuing to invest in FPL's grid to make it stronger and more resilient for our customers. Almost all of FPL's transmission system has been hardened with concrete or steel towers or poles, and we continue to invest in undergrounding our distribution system to further enhance reliability and resiliency for customers. The capital plan of the current rate agreement of $32 billion to $34 billion extends our customer value proposition and provides clear visibility for growth through 2025. Beyond 2025, we continue to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida's economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country. FPL is responsible for keeping the lights on for approximately $2 billion per day of Florida's GDP. These long-term growth prospects coupled with investment opportunities and renewables and transmission and distribution infrastructure enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition and support our belief that FPL is the highest quality rate regulatory utility in the country. Energy Resources' deep expertise in renewables and transmission serves as a key differentiator with customers. As a result of our data-driven development playbook, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts to our backlog. Driven in part by the roughly 5, 600 megawatts placed in service in 2023, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings almost 13% versus 2022. Energy Resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63 gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026. That would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries. Energy Resources also is extending its excellent track record of optimizing our existing footprint to create additional shareholder value. To date, we have repowered six gigawatts of our existing 24 gigawatt wind operating fleet, investing roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources' wind footprint could be roughly 32 gigawatts, and with over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering, it represents a great opportunity set. We believe there are multiple opportunities to drive value from the existing footprint, multiple wind repowers, adding solar underneath existing wind and locating battery storage with existing wind and solar. And we have dedicated teams leveraging our development playbook to optimize our existing and future fleet. We can maximize existing land, permits, interconnection capacity, and operations to provide enhanced value to customers and shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources could operate up to 53 gigawatts of generation with the potential to co-locate battery storage, which represents a great long-term opportunity, especially considering the likely future capacity needs of customers. Throughout 2023, Energy Resources also continue to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business. As growth and renewables occur throughout the U.S., there is a growing imperative to build additional or upgrade existing transmission. 2023 was a record year for our competitive transmission business. NextEra Energy transmission was awarded projects to construct transmission in PJM, CAISO and SPP that would roughly double the investments made in the existing business. We anticipate deploying approximately $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 to complete these transmission projects, which we estimate could enable up to 12 gigawatts of new renewables. Beyond 2026, Energy Resources is strategically positioned to benefit significantly from the irreversible shift towards electrification. With renewables only comprising roughly 16% of the U.S. generating mix, Energy Resources is just getting started. Renewable penetration is expected to double to over 30% by 2030, and Energy Resources is ready. We have a substantial development pipeline, including roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions for new renewables and storage projects. We believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers, both businesses complement each other, push one another to be better, and together create scale and foster innovation. We have one of the sectors strongest balance sheets and constructed and placed in the service roughly 6, 800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects in 2023. To put that into context, 6, 800 megawatts of installed U.S. renewable generating capacity is enough on its own to rank as the fourth largest U.S. renewable energy company and the 14th largest utility. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnership's transition plans and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. Last September, we made the tough decision to reduce the target distribution growth rate to 6% when NextEra Energy Partners no longer benefited from a competitive cost to capital. With a growth rate now comparable to its peers, we are focused on the partnership's cost to capital improving, which is critical for its future success. Towards that end, we are evaluating alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financings with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. We are executing against the transition plans and with the closing of the Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership has addressed two of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings. The STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing has been extinguished and we have sufficient proceeds available to complete the NEP Renewables to buyouts that are due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect the need and acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth and LP distributions per unit target and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. We are executing against the growth plans and have identified approximately 985 megawatts of wind repowers through 2026 making progress against our expectations. As we turn the page on 2023 and head into 2024, we are optimistic about the renewable sector, about our opportunity set, about customer demand, and about NextEra Energy\u2019s future. Demand for renewables has never been stronger, and yet the challenges have never been more complex, making the stakes even higher for customers. Our scale and competitive advantages are enabling us to be the partner of choice with both power and commercial and industrial customers. On March 14th, we will discuss Energy Resources development process in greater detail at our Development Investor event in Juno Beach and illustrate how our proprietary tools differentiate Energy Resources with customers. And then on June 11th, we will hold our NextEra Energy Investor Day in New York to discuss our long-term plans for both Energy Resources and FPL. Our optimism for NextEra Energy's future flows from the strength of our two world class businesses, FPL and Energy Resources, that leverage our scale and competitive advantages to differentiate themselves as leaders. Our optimism is driven from our proven playbooks of deploying capital and renewables and transmission to create value for customers. But I am most optimistic because we have spent the last two decades building a world class team at NextEra Energy, and it is, by far, our greatest competitive strength. Our team lives and breathes a culture of continuous improvement working together to solve the tough challenges of the day. We drive innovation relying on data analytics and automation to make better decisions, and we have developed and deployed smart, low cost, clean energy solutions that lead our industry. Most importantly, our team remains hyper focused on continuing our long track record of execution, serving our customers with excellence and providing long term value for shareholders. With that let me turn it over to Kirk who will review the 2023 results in more detail.\nKirk Crews : Thanks John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2023 FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.22 versus 2022. FPL's adjusted earnings results exclude the approximately $300 million after tax gain on the sale of Florida City Gas which closed on November 30th 2023. The principal driver of the 2023 full year performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.5%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth and regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the full year 2023, we used approximately $227 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a yearend 2023 balance of roughly $1.2 billion. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.4 billion. These capital investments supported the successful commissioning of roughly 1, 200 megawatts of solar in 2023, continued hardening of the grid, and our efforts to underground our distribution system. During the fourth quarter of 2023, our 25 megawatt hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center successfully achieved commercial operations. As a reminder, we plan to utilize this facility together with adjacent solar projects to create green hydrogen and blend it with natural gas at our Okeechobee plant. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Florida's economy continues to trend upward, and its GDP is now roughly $1.6 trillion, an increase of 9.3% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FPL's retail sales increased 1.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth, which increased by nearly 81, 000 from the prior year comparable quarter. For the full year 2023, FPL retail sales increased 0.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year adjusted earnings growth of approximately 12.9% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.35 per share due to strong growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from our existing clean energy assets decreased results by $0.11 per share, driven primarily by the impact of weaker wind resource. 2023 was the lowest wind resource on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.16 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses. Other decreased results by $0.26 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.22 per share, of which $0.10 was driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 2, 060 megawatts since our last call. Our 2023 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and to replace uneconomic generation and commercial and industrial customers looking to help decarbonize their operation or meet their data center and AI demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 20 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 2, 470 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our third quarter call. We believe our 20 gigawatt backlog provides clear visibility and Energy Resources\u2019 ability to deliver for shareholders through 2026 and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year adjusted earnings from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.08 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows, including the sale of tax credits as well as our historical funding sources. In 2023, we grew cash flow from operations well in excess of our adjusted earnings. We transferred approximately $400 million of tax credits, establishing relationships with numerous counterparties. We believe this will prove to be a competitive advantage as buyers look first to NextEra Energy given its size, experience, and the overall quality of its tax credit program. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2026 remain consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter earnings call. We continue to believe NextEra Energy is well positioned to manage the interest rate environment. While the recent decline in interest rates is encouraging, we remain committed to managing the business to deliver value for customers and shareholders. Overall, we believe we are well positioned with $18.5 billion of interest rate swaps and we will continue to closely monitor the interest rate environment as the clients and rates certainly represent a tail end for our sector and customers. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For the last 14 consecutive years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectation, which is a record we are proud of. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. In terms of the transition plans, NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of Texas pipeline portfolio in late December, providing net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. NextEra Energy Partners expect to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts of roughly $190 million and $950 million on their stated minimum buyout dates of June 2024 and 2025, respectively, as the partnerships continue to benefit from the low cash coupon through 2025. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners ' growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3 gigawatt of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today, we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 245 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 985 MW of repowers with strong cash available for distribution yields. While the partnership does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024, the LP distribution growth target of 6% is supported, in part with roughly 175 MW of wind repowers, which are expected to generate attractive cash available for distribution yields. Finally, we were pleased with the high yield note issuance of $750 million, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. This opportunistic refinancing allowed the partnership to pay off its corporate revolver in mid-December. Let me now turn to the financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, and cash available for distribution was $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions and the incentive distribution's right fee suspension, while cash available for distribution was also impacted by incremental debt service. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.9 billion, up 13.6% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the contribution for new projects acquired in late 2022 and during 2023 and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension. New investments added approximately $228 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension added approximately $113 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. This growth was partially offset by a decline from existing projects driven primarily by weaker wind resource. Cash available for distribution was $689 million for the full year and primarily driven by contributions from new projects of approximately $42 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension of $113 million while being partially offset by the weaker wind resource. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.88 per common unit or $3.52 per unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its third quarter 2023 distribution per unit. The partnership grew its LP distributions per unit by more than 8% year-over-year. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnership payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners is introducing December 31, 2024 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and cash available for distribution in a range of $730 million to $820 million reflecting calendar year 2025 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Just starting on NEP, if it's okay, just on the higher repowering opportunities you announced, I guess how are you sort of thinking about funding it? And really more importantly, is there any specific status on the money pool that could be looking to buy in directly into projects, whether it's dropdowns or organic growth at the NEP level? Could these sort of equity investors help solved the \u201826 growth and financing issues? And I guess when do you plan to update on that?\nKirk Crews : Sure. So with respect to repowering, Shahr, we look at that as on the project level. There are really two options there. We can look at it from a project financing standpoint and pair that with transferability, or we can look at it as tax equity. So we will look at both of those options and decide that at the time of the repowerings. With respect to your second question, there's, we're looking at all options right now, as John said, in the prepared remarks. We are exploring a number of opportunities and alternatives for addressing the convertible equity portfolio financing that are coming due in 2027 and beyond. There's really not a timeframe in terms of the update now, but we are looking at all options and with the goal of really maximizing unit holder value.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it.\nJohn Ketchum: And Shahr, this is John, just adding on to that again, on the repowers. Just like we do at the, I mean, just think about it as tax equity and project finance.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay.\nJohn Ketchum: And again, the private capital raises provide us with a number of options, but we're looking at a lot of different alternatives, that being one of them.\nShahriar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then lastly, John, we haven't had any updates from the FEC, has anything sort of been communicated to you regarding sort of the investigation how quickly you would look to settle, assuming they take up the case. And as we're kind of thinking about the process, right, it's confidential. So curious on how you're going to update investors, like would we see a press release or 8-K from you confirming the FEC process and that you'll update investors in the future on next steps, or could we see a single communication on the FEC pickup and a concurrent settlement, let's say? I'm just trying to assess how long this could be an overhang, assuming the case moves forward and whether you've already laid the groundwork for all options to get this kind of past this quick when a ruling comes out. Thank you.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, thanks for the question, Shahr. So let me just take those in order. First of all, there's no update. We have not been contacted by the FEC. And I think just to remind investors of the timing, first of all, these are just guidelines I'm going to give you. I mean, there is no prescribed timeline in terms of the FEC providing a response to us. But as you may recall, we originally received the FEC complaint, I guess is what you would call it, that had been filed by a group called CREW back in November of 2022. And if you follow the historical precedent of the FEC, it's usually 12 to 18 months after you first are notified of a complaint having been filed, that you would learn whether or not the FEC decides to find that there's reason to believe that they ought to conduct an investigation. We have not heard anything from the FEC in that regard. The second thing I would remind investors of is this is not material again these were five allegations totaling political contributions of roughly $1.3 million to $1.5 million. So we're talking about smaller dollar amounts and how and when we would update investors would depend on what exactly we hear from the FEC.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess a couple of big picture questions. First, obviously a lot more focus in the elections now as we're in \u201824 and curious your thoughts in the event of Republican trifecta so to speak just how you're thinking about the sustainability of IRA provisions.\nJohn Ketchum: Sure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that, this is John. First of all in the 21 years I've been at the company, as we've changed administrations and we've seen changes in Congress, we've never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they've taken, IRA is the form we're talking about here. So that's the first point I would make. Second, it's really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It's just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it's flowing to Republican states and it's flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we're talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it's a complete turnaround for these communities. We're providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We're providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We're providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward. Just think about hospitals and staffing doctors at county hospitals or teach -- paying teacher salaries. I mean, the property tax revenues have significant benefits. And so for those reasons, we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle. So see any repeal of IRAs being unlikely.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And I guess two other big picture questions on the renewable space. And it's just any kind of new thoughts color on your data center strategy and also your thoughts on hydrogen after the based on the proposed rules that came out.\nRebecca Kujawa : Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca. First on the data centers, clearly there's an enormous amount of demand being driven across the U.S. economy by the growth in data centers, driven by a lot of things, of course, but specifically, generative AI, and that growth is pretty explosive at this point. And I think the characteristics of that demand are a little bit unique in driving different ways in approaching the marketplace for a number of these technology companies where it is imperative that these projects get built on time, on budget, and produce the energy that they're expecting because the opportunity cost for these customers is so significant if they aren't able to power them and, of course, meet the commitments that they've made to their own stakeholders. So we're seeing those relationships expand and also deepen, where it's not just signing the megawatts of the day, but also working with them collaboratively over a long period of time to ensure that they get the energy and capacity that they need where they needed to support their projects. Just alone in our backlog, not even counting what we have installed, we have over three gigawatts of projects that we're building in the coming years for these customers. And I do believe that's the tip of the iceberg. And again, not even talking about what we already have installed. So it's pretty exciting. And our team is very ingrained in working with these customers. And we're excited about the years ahead. And then turning to hydrogen, obviously the guidance that first came out, the draft guidance in December, is really steering towards hydrogen projects that will be essentially from day one, needing to match on an hourly basis. And that, of course, increases the ultimate cost of hydrogen. And unfortunately, I think if it stands as currently drafted, would limit to an extent how much will be built for the U.S. market. We're obviously advocating more of a relaxed matching requirements of more of an annual match for a period of time and then transitioning to hourly over time so that you can kick start a hydrogen market. And hopefully the administration will hear that and know that having a kick started hydrogen economy will certainly further their ambitious goals, which of course we are very excited about meeting to see the full decarbonization of the U.S. economy over time. So more work to be done and we are excited to pursue the marketplace. Regardless, these are probably end of the decade type projects, so more of an investment in the near term for opportunities in the long term.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe on the renewables demand side of things, could you give a little bit more detail on the origination trends that you're seeing? I guess it looked like solar and storage quite strong in the quarter, but then wind a little bit lower in terms of the new bookings added. Maybe what's your latest confidence in achieving those \u201825 and \u201826 targets, particularly on the wind side of the business?\nRebecca Kujawa : Hey, David. It's Rebecca. I'll take a first cut at that. We're obviously excited about the origination, as John and Kirk have highlighted, originating 17 gigawatts over the last two years, and both years serving as a record, so this year topping last year's record is very exciting. We also, of course, see the mix being more focused towards solar and storage, and as I've commented in the past, I think some of this is an after effect of the strong demand that we saw going into 2020 when we and others thought that the production tax credit would ultimately phase down and then ultimately go to zero over a period of time, so there was a pull forward of demand. And then the second dynamic that I think has impacted the short term is that the solar production tax credit clearly stimulated near-term demand and deployments for our customers, and obviously we're very excited about that. Storage is growing at least as well as we thought, perhaps exceeding even our expectations in terms of adoption, not just in the Western markets, but now really spreading in a very constructive way through the Midwest, and we've got, as John highlighted in the prepared remarks, a really advantaged position to be able to respond quickly to the demand characteristics that we're seeing where our customers need capacity quickly, where they hadn't anticipated the demand that they would see in their underlying business. And so getting to market quickly is very much a premium and a priority, and we're there to serve them well. In that storage market, as we've talked about from a returns characteristic standpoint, it's an awful lot like wind, and it's certainly complex to deliver the value that our customers are looking for in the various streams. I'd say the other part that is at least as strong as we anticipated when we laid out the expectations is repowering. And we're excited about the economics of that and economics specifically in context to the value that it brings to our customers, bringing some incremental generation and extending the life of these projects, often extending the contracts with our customers at the same times that we do repowering. So overall, with all those comments in context, I feel really good about meeting our development expectations in aggregate. We'll continue to look at the mix in individual technologies over time. But at this point, we are obviously leaving the ranges as we've had them now for a couple of years, in part to reflect what I'm sure you recall, wind is a very short development cycle. Maybe not the actual laying the groundwork to be able to build a project, but when we enter into a contract and acquire the term and put it into service, it can be as short as nine months. So there's still a lot of time left between now and the end of \u201826 to add more wind to not only the backlog, but ultimately commission. And when I look at the forward couple of quarters, there are a couple of chunky opportunities that our teams are working on, and I feel good about bringing them some of those to fruition.\nDavid Arcaro: Excellent. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then maybe secondarily, just it sounds like the backdrop has gotten more challenging for small developers in the renewable space, wondering if you're seeing opportunities for market share gain as a result, and potentially any development pipelines to pick up from developers that might be struggling right now.\nRebecca Kujawa : Sure. We always are out in the development right acquisition market. In the recent couple of years, we've really prioritized our greenfield portfolio, in part because of our ability to work so closely with our customers and make sure that we're building the projects over the long term where they need them. But we will always be opportunistic in the development project market to be selective and create opportunities where it may be particularly attractive. The dynamic from a couple of years ago where a number of the development portfolios were acquired by folks looking to, I would say, compete with us, but certainly have a bigger presence on the development side. We haven't seen those holistically come back to market. I think that may change over time. I know the private equity cycle of wanting to be able to turn over capital quickly and realize isn't necessarily completely aligned with the development cycle where sometimes things are a little bit faster or a little bit slower than you anticipated, and you need to be patient. So I'm optimistic there'll be opportunities. But most importantly, and this is one of the things that we'll focus on in March, is we want to keep our fate, our development opportunities in our own hands. And I am super excited about what our team is working on from a greenfield development standpoint and the competitive advantages that we're investing in to make sure that we can serve our customers well, not just in the next two or three years as we often talk about with you all, but the next five, seven, 10 years plus down the road.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carly Davenport of Goldman Sachs.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I wanted to just ask about transmission. You highlighted the $1.9 billion of capital through \u201827 at NEER. And as we look at the EBITDA contributions at NEER for 2024 that piece is moving higher as well. So could you just talk a bit about what sort of growth you could see at NEER over the next several years and what that EBITDA contribution could be over time?\nRebecca Kujawa : Good morning, Carly. So from the pipeline perspective, is no doubt you appreciate transmission opportunities take a couple of years to come to fruition. So we're thrilled with the awards that the team has been able to secure in the last year on one part of it, building on investments that we already have, so expansion opportunities that are significantly enabling new renewables development headed into the California market. And then other parts of the US competitive opportunities that we won through competitive processes. In terms of timing, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, the in -service dates are out to 2027. So as we invest capital, obviously that'll start to become more of a material contribution over time. And we'll give more color as we get into the investor conference as we typically do to give more of a breakdown by business and what those contributions will look like over time. But the momentum is terrific. And as we've highlighted, everybody understands, maybe not to the extent that we think it's going to happen, but in order to unlock the renewables opportunity that we and others see across the United States, transmission needs to be built. And we stand ready to be a part of the solution wherever we can be and bring cost effective solutions to customers.\nCarly Davenport: Great, thank you for that. And then maybe just one more on the financing side for this year, just based on what you've seen so far in the markets, how are you thinking about the mix of the different avenues that you can use to monetize tax credits, whether through tax equity or transferability? How do we think about the sort of magnitude of each of those in your financing plans for \u201824?\nKirk Crews : Yes, Carly, this Kirk, the financing plan as we shared in our prepared remarks is consistent with the information, we shared on the third quarter call. And as we approach those options, we will use the historical approaches, project finance and tax equity. But we're also very encouraged by what we're seeing with the transferability market. We are having really good progress with, in those conversations, we're seeing really good demand for the NextEra Energy tax credit. And ultimately, we look at all those as options and will optimize between project finance and transferability and tax equity. And we'll use those within the ranges that we shared and the \u201824 to \u201826 funding plan that we provided between those -- between the disclosure that we provided. But we are seeing really good demand for the credits and expect to continue to utilize transferability as an option going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to build off that a little bit as what you talked about before. How do you balance, I guess, looking forward the wealth of growth opportunities and associate funding needs relative to dividend growth? Do you look at industry trends for dividend growth at all and how that might change as utility CapEx increases and just a final point there, just wondering how the EMP business competes for capital against everything else that you have in a lower gas price environment.\nKirk Crews : Sure. So we, when we look at capital allocation and you look at, we shared on the third quarter call the returns that we see within the renewable business and as we shared then at Energy Resources within for when we see returns in the low 20s on a levered ROE basis. In solar, we see returns in the mid-teens and then storage is also in the low 20s. And so it's great returns and we look to get capital allocated to the renewable business. And that as John discussed in the prepared remarks, we are allocating capital across both businesses in renewables and transmission. And so that is the priority with the way that we allocate capital. And then in terms of the funding of that, again, it's the way that we've traditionally funded the business, it\u2019s tax equity, it\u2019s project finance, and then we also use the transferability provisions.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe just pivoting a little bit towards the backlog. A lot of additions in the quarter, but there was a little bit of fell out, I think, 350 and there was a little bit more in the post 2026 timeframe that's in the backlog. So just wondering if you could talk a bit more on kind of some of the drivers, the puts and takes within the portfolio addition composition over time.\nRebecca Kujawa : Sure, I'll take that. In terms of the, obviously the backlog additions are quite strong and we're thrilled about that. And for this quarter, in terms of the removal that we had, it's really project specific items and one part is really related to higher interconnection costs for a particular project where we need to go back and do a little bit more work, very likely these project megawatts will come back into the backlog. They're good projects, but in near term we're removing them while we work through the issues. We, I think it's important to keep in mind that as we add something to the backlog, it's tremendous visibility and we're really excited about moving forward with the projects based on what we know at the time. But this is still a development business and there are things that you have to work through before you commit significant capital to a project and occasionally some of those things that we work through are better. Sometimes they're a little bit worse and we need to make the decisions that are ultimately right for our shareholders at the time that we need to make them. So in context of a 20 plus gigawatt portfolio, I think it's de minimis for what is kind of the normal run rate for development type issues. And fortunately we've worked through the issues that we had talked about over the last two years around anti -dumping, countervailing duties and the significant changes in the marketplace related to the inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rates. So at this point I think we're in kind of like normal development, every once in a while, there's something that changes our view on a specific project and we're going to do the right thing from a shareholder perspective and only commit capital where it makes sense.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. The conference has now also concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks John. Let's begin with FPL's detailed results. For the full year 2023 FPL's adjusted earnings per share increased $0.22 versus 2022. FPL's adjusted earnings results exclude the approximately $300 million after tax gain on the sale of Florida City Gas which closed on November 30th 2023. The principal driver of the 2023 full year performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.5%. We continue to expect FPL's average annual growth and regulatory capital employed to be roughly 9% over the four year term of our current rate agreement, which runs through 2025. For the full year 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the full year 2023, we used approximately $227 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a yearend 2023 balance of roughly $1.2 billion. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $9.4 billion. These capital investments supported the successful commissioning of roughly 1, 200 megawatts of solar in 2023, continued hardening of the grid, and our efforts to underground our distribution system. During the fourth quarter of 2023, our 25 megawatt hydrogen pilot at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center successfully achieved commercial operations. As a reminder, we plan to utilize this facility together with adjacent solar projects to create green hydrogen and blend it with natural gas at our Okeechobee plant. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains strong and Florida's population continues to be one of the fastest growing in the country. Florida's economy continues to trend upward, and its GDP is now roughly $1.6 trillion, an increase of 9.3% over last year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, FPL's retail sales increased 1.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, driven primarily by continued strong customer growth, which increased by nearly 81, 000 from the prior year comparable quarter. For the full year 2023, FPL retail sales increased 0.6% from the prior year on a weather normalized basis, also driven primarily by the strong customer growth in our service territory. Now, let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported full year adjusted earnings growth of approximately 12.9% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased by $0.35 per share due to strong growth in our renewables and storage portfolio. Contributions from our existing clean energy assets decreased results by $0.11 per share, driven primarily by the impact of weaker wind resource. 2023 was the lowest wind resource on record over the past 30 years. Our customer supply and trading business increased results by $0.16 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses. Other decreased results by $0.26 per share year-over-year. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.22 per share, of which $0.10 was driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources delivered our best year ever for origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts of new renewables and battery storage projects to our backlog, which includes approximately 2, 060 megawatts since our last call. Our 2023 origination performance reflects continued strong demand from power customers looking for the least cost alternative to serve load and to replace uneconomic generation and commercial and industrial customers looking to help decarbonize their operation or meet their data center and AI demand. Our renewables backlog now stands at more than 20 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 2, 470 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our third quarter call. We believe our 20 gigawatt backlog provides clear visibility and Energy Resources' ability to deliver for shareholders through 2026 and beyond. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the full year adjusted earnings from our corporate and other segment decreased by $0.08 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We successfully supported the growth in our underlying businesses from our strong operating cash flows, including the sale of tax credits as well as our historical funding sources. In 2023, we grew cash flow from operations well in excess of our adjusted earnings. We transferred approximately $400 million of tax credits, establishing relationships with numerous counterparties. We believe this will prove to be a competitive advantage as buyers look first to NextEra Energy given its size, experience, and the overall quality of its tax credit program. Overall, our funding plans for 2024 through 2026 remain consistent with the information we shared on the third quarter earnings call. We continue to believe NextEra Energy is well positioned to manage the interest rate environment. While the recent decline in interest rates is encouraging, we remain committed to managing the business to deliver value for customers and shareholders. Overall, we believe we are well positioned with $18.5 billion of interest rate swaps and we will continue to closely monitor the interest rate environment as the clients and rates certainly represent a tail end for our sector and customers. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For the last 14 consecutive years, NextEra Energy has met or exceeded its financial expectation, which is a record we are proud of. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. In terms of the transition plans, NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of Texas pipeline portfolio in late December, providing net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. NextEra Energy Partners expect to complete the NEP Renewables II buyouts of roughly $190 million and $950 million on their stated minimum buyout dates of June 2024 and 2025, respectively, as the partnerships continue to benefit from the low cash coupon through 2025. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners ' growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically repowerings of approximately 1.3 gigawatt of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today, we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 245 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 985 MW of repowers with strong cash available for distribution yields. While the partnership does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024, the LP distribution growth target of 6% is supported, in part with roughly 175 MW of wind repowers, which are expected to generate attractive cash available for distribution yields. Finally, we were pleased with the high yield note issuance of $750 million, which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2023. This opportunistic refinancing allowed the partnership to pay off its corporate revolver in mid-December. Let me now turn to the financial results for NextEra Energy Partners. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $454 million, and cash available for distribution was $86 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year comparable quarter was primarily due to new asset additions and the incentive distribution's right fee suspension, while cash available for distribution was also impacted by incremental debt service. For the full year 2023, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.9 billion, up 13.6% year-over-year, and was primarily driven by the contribution for new projects acquired in late 2022 and during 2023 and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension. New investments added approximately $228 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension added approximately $113 million of adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. This growth was partially offset by a decline from existing projects driven primarily by weaker wind resource. Cash available for distribution was $689 million for the full year and primarily driven by contributions from new projects of approximately $42 million and the Incentive Distribution Right Fee Suspension of $113 million while being partially offset by the weaker wind resource. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.88 per common unit or $3.52 per unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its third quarter 2023 distribution per unit. The partnership grew its LP distributions per unit by more than 8% year-over-year. From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnership payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners is introducing December 31, 2024 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and cash available for distribution in a range of $730 million to $820 million reflecting calendar year 2025 expectations for the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that, we will open the line for questions. Sure. So with respect to repowering, Shahr, we look at that as on the project level. There are really two options there. We can look at it from a project financing standpoint and pair that with transferability, or we can look at it as tax equity. So we will look at both of those options and decide that at the time of the repowerings. With respect to your second question, there's, we're looking at all options right now, as John said, in the prepared remarks. We are exploring a number of opportunities and alternatives for addressing the convertible equity portfolio financing that are coming due in 2027 and beyond. There's really not a timeframe in terms of the update now, but we are looking at all options and with the goal of really maximizing unit holder value. Yes, Carly, this Kirk, the financing plan as we shared in our prepared remarks is consistent with the information, we shared on the third quarter call. And as we approach those options, we will use the historical approaches, project finance and tax equity. But we're also very encouraged by what we're seeing with the transferability market. We are having really good progress with, in those conversations, we're seeing really good demand for the NextEra Energy tax credit. And ultimately, we look at all those as options and will optimize between project finance and transferability and tax equity. And we'll use those within the ranges that we shared and the \u201824 to \u201826 funding plan that we provided between those -- between the disclosure that we provided. But we are seeing really good demand for the credits and expect to continue to utilize transferability as an option going forward. Sure. So we, when we look at capital allocation and you look at, we shared on the third quarter call the returns that we see within the renewable business and as we shared then at Energy Resources within for when we see returns in the low 20s on a levered ROE basis. In solar, we see returns in the mid-teens and then storage is also in the low 20s. And so it's great returns and we look to get capital allocated to the renewable business. And that as John discussed in the prepared remarks, we are allocating capital across both businesses in renewables and transmission. And so that is the priority with the way that we allocate capital. And then in terms of the funding of that, again, it's the way that we've traditionally funded the business, it's tax equity, it's project finance, and then we also use the transferability provisions."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Good morning, Steve. It's Rebecca. First on the data centers, clearly there's an enormous amount of demand being driven across the U.S. economy by the growth in data centers, driven by a lot of things, of course, but specifically, generative AI, and that growth is pretty explosive at this point. And I think the characteristics of that demand are a little bit unique in driving different ways in approaching the marketplace for a number of these technology companies where it is imperative that these projects get built on time, on budget, and produce the energy that they're expecting because the opportunity cost for these customers is so significant if they aren't able to power them and, of course, meet the commitments that they've made to their own stakeholders. So we're seeing those relationships expand and also deepen, where it's not just signing the megawatts of the day, but also working with them collaboratively over a long period of time to ensure that they get the energy and capacity that they need where they needed to support their projects. Just alone in our backlog, not even counting what we have installed, we have over three gigawatts of projects that we're building in the coming years for these customers. And I do believe that's the tip of the iceberg. And again, not even talking about what we already have installed. So it's pretty exciting. And our team is very ingrained in working with these customers. And we're excited about the years ahead. And then turning to hydrogen, obviously the guidance that first came out, the draft guidance in December, is really steering towards hydrogen projects that will be essentially from day one, needing to match on an hourly basis. And that, of course, increases the ultimate cost of hydrogen. And unfortunately, I think if it stands as currently drafted, would limit to an extent how much will be built for the U.S. market. We're obviously advocating more of a relaxed matching requirements of more of an annual match for a period of time and then transitioning to hourly over time so that you can kick start a hydrogen market. And hopefully the administration will hear that and know that having a kick started hydrogen economy will certainly further their ambitious goals, which of course we are very excited about meeting to see the full decarbonization of the U.S. economy over time. So more work to be done and we are excited to pursue the marketplace. Regardless, these are probably end of the decade type projects, so more of an investment in the near term for opportunities in the long term. Hey, David. It's Rebecca. I'll take a first cut at that. We're obviously excited about the origination, as John and Kirk have highlighted, originating 17 gigawatts over the last two years, and both years serving as a record, so this year topping last year's record is very exciting. We also, of course, see the mix being more focused towards solar and storage, and as I've commented in the past, I think some of this is an after effect of the strong demand that we saw going into 2020 when we and others thought that the production tax credit would ultimately phase down and then ultimately go to zero over a period of time, so there was a pull forward of demand. And then the second dynamic that I think has impacted the short term is that the solar production tax credit clearly stimulated near-term demand and deployments for our customers, and obviously we're very excited about that. Storage is growing at least as well as we thought, perhaps exceeding even our expectations in terms of adoption, not just in the Western markets, but now really spreading in a very constructive way through the Midwest, and we've got, as John highlighted in the prepared remarks, a really advantaged position to be able to respond quickly to the demand characteristics that we're seeing where our customers need capacity quickly, where they hadn't anticipated the demand that they would see in their underlying business. And so getting to market quickly is very much a premium and a priority, and we're there to serve them well. In that storage market, as we've talked about from a returns characteristic standpoint, it's an awful lot like wind, and it's certainly complex to deliver the value that our customers are looking for in the various streams. I'd say the other part that is at least as strong as we anticipated when we laid out the expectations is repowering. And we're excited about the economics of that and economics specifically in context to the value that it brings to our customers, bringing some incremental generation and extending the life of these projects, often extending the contracts with our customers at the same times that we do repowering. So overall, with all those comments in context, I feel really good about meeting our development expectations in aggregate. We'll continue to look at the mix in individual technologies over time. But at this point, we are obviously leaving the ranges as we've had them now for a couple of years, in part to reflect what I'm sure you recall, wind is a very short development cycle. Maybe not the actual laying the groundwork to be able to build a project, but when we enter into a contract and acquire the term and put it into service, it can be as short as nine months. So there's still a lot of time left between now and the end of \u201826 to add more wind to not only the backlog, but ultimately commission. And when I look at the forward couple of quarters, there are a couple of chunky opportunities that our teams are working on, and I feel good about bringing them some of those to fruition. Sure. We always are out in the development right acquisition market. In the recent couple of years, we've really prioritized our greenfield portfolio, in part because of our ability to work so closely with our customers and make sure that we're building the projects over the long term where they need them. But we will always be opportunistic in the development project market to be selective and create opportunities where it may be particularly attractive. The dynamic from a couple of years ago where a number of the development portfolios were acquired by folks looking to, I would say, compete with us, but certainly have a bigger presence on the development side. We haven't seen those holistically come back to market. I think that may change over time. I know the private equity cycle of wanting to be able to turn over capital quickly and realize isn't necessarily completely aligned with the development cycle where sometimes things are a little bit faster or a little bit slower than you anticipated, and you need to be patient. So I'm optimistic there'll be opportunities. But most importantly, and this is one of the things that we'll focus on in March, is we want to keep our fate, our development opportunities in our own hands. And I am super excited about what our team is working on from a greenfield development standpoint and the competitive advantages that we're investing in to make sure that we can serve our customers well, not just in the next two or three years as we often talk about with you all, but the next five, seven, 10 years plus down the road. Good morning, Carly. So from the pipeline perspective, is no doubt you appreciate transmission opportunities take a couple of years to come to fruition. So we're thrilled with the awards that the team has been able to secure in the last year on one part of it, building on investments that we already have, so expansion opportunities that are significantly enabling new renewables development headed into the California market. And then other parts of the US competitive opportunities that we won through competitive processes. In terms of timing, as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, the in -service dates are out to 2027. So as we invest capital, obviously that'll start to become more of a material contribution over time. And we'll give more color as we get into the investor conference as we typically do to give more of a breakdown by business and what those contributions will look like over time. But the momentum is terrific. And as we've highlighted, everybody understands, maybe not to the extent that we think it's going to happen, but in order to unlock the renewables opportunity that we and others see across the United States, transmission needs to be built. And we stand ready to be a part of the solution wherever we can be and bring cost effective solutions to customers. Sure, I'll take that. In terms of the, obviously the backlog additions are quite strong and we're thrilled about that. And for this quarter, in terms of the removal that we had, it's really project specific items and one part is really related to higher interconnection costs for a particular project where we need to go back and do a little bit more work, very likely these project megawatts will come back into the backlog. They're good projects, but in near term we're removing them while we work through the issues. We, I think it's important to keep in mind that as we add something to the backlog, it's tremendous visibility and we're really excited about moving forward with the projects based on what we know at the time. But this is still a development business and there are things that you have to work through before you commit significant capital to a project and occasionally some of those things that we work through are better. Sometimes they're a little bit worse and we need to make the decisions that are ultimately right for our shareholders at the time that we need to make them. So in context of a 20 plus gigawatt portfolio, I think it's de minimis for what is kind of the normal run rate for development type issues. And fortunately we've worked through the issues that we had talked about over the last two years around anti -dumping, countervailing duties and the significant changes in the marketplace related to the inflationary pressures and changes in the interest rates.

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristen, and good morning. NextEra Energy has strong operational and financial performance at both FPL and Energy Resources in 2023. NextEra Energy delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $3.17, up over 9% from 2022, exceeding the high end of our adjusted EPS expectations range. From solar supply chain challenges to higher inflation and interest rates, NextEra Energy navigated through a challenging environment for the last two years, delivering compound annual adjusted EPS growth of roughly 11.5% since 2021. These were unprecedented events for our sector and clear headwinds for renewables, but disruption often presents opportunity. At NextEra Energy, we relied on our 25 years of renewables experience and our culture of execution to navigate this tough environment. On the strengths of our scale and competitive advantages, our world class supply chain capabilities, customer relationships, access to and cost of capital advantages, the strength of our balance sheet, our data driven development playbook, and our team just to a name few we successfully manage through the disruption. Our scale and competitive advantages served as key differentiators and allowed us to continue to deliver for our customers and extend our long track record of earnings and dividend growth. Over the past 10 years, we have delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 10%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies. Over that same period, the remaining top 10 power companies have achieved, on average, compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of roughly 2%. Notwithstanding the strong adjusted EPS results, we recognize and are disappointed by the underperformance in the share price. And as we start 2024, we remain steadfast in our continued focus on execution and creating long-term value for shareholders. We believe that disruption over the last two years has made NextEra Energy an even stronger company. Our business model is more resilient, our development platform is even more advanced, and our supply chain is more diversified than it has ever been. Bottom line, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned headed into 2024. And there is good reason for optimism at NextEra Energy. Although nobody can predict with certainty what 2024 will bring, inflation and interest rates have declined from their peak, and NextEra Energy has taken steps to mitigate its exposure to interest rate volatility through its interest rate hedging program. The Commerce Department has provided the final determination around circumvention, providing solar suppliers with more certainty around the rules and expectations of importing solar equipment. New solar supply chains have been established in the U.S. and internationally, leading to lower solar panel prices, and we see the continued longer-term push towards EVs as being incrementally positive for continued reductions in battery prices. Solar panel and battery prices have already declined by roughly 25% from their peak over the last 24 months, heading into 2024. We have proactively procured critical electrical equipment to complete our renewable projects, securing enough transformers and breakers to cover our expected build through 2027. And due to our scale and construction partnerships, we have not experienced any labor shortages impacting project timelines. Ultimately, all these tailwinds are great for customers, and we believe should drive greater renewables demand in 2024 and beyond, all on the heels of consecutive record years for new renewables originations at Energy Resources in 2022 and 2023, totaling over 17 gigawatts. NextEra Energy offers a unique value proposition with two strong businesses that we believe are strategically positioned with outstanding prospects for future growth. FPL, which represents more than two thirds of our company, is the nation's largest electric utility and continues to deliver what we believe is the best customer value proposition and one of the fastest growing states in the US. Energy Resources, the world's renewables leader, has differentiated itself in an industry in which scale, experience, and being well capitalized matters. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers, providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we identify investment opportunities that drive value for customers and support Florida's growing economy while keeping bills approximately 30% lower than the national average. We focus on running the business efficiently and continue to lead the industry with the lowest nonfuel O&M per megawatt hour of any large utility in the nation. Our emphasis on modernizing FPL's generation fleet to improve efficiency and reduce fuel costs has saved customers over $15 billion since 2001. We continue this trend in 2023 by placing into service approximately 1, 200 megawatts of cost effective solar and expect to add roughly 4, 800 megawatts over the current rate agreement. And by 2032, we expect to increase FPL's solar from 5% of our total generation today to roughly 35% by adding over 15, 000 incremental megawatts. We are also continuing to invest in FPL's grid to make it stronger and more resilient for our customers. Almost all of FPL's transmission system has been hardened with concrete or steel towers or poles, and we continue to invest in undergrounding our distribution system to further enhance reliability and resiliency for customers. The capital plan of the current rate agreement of $32 billion to $34 billion extends our customer value proposition and provides clear visibility for growth through 2025. Beyond 2025, we continue to believe FPL is strategically well positioned as Florida remains one of the fastest growing states in the U.S. with a population growth that is expected to roughly double the national average through 2030. Florida's economy is also growing and is now the 14th largest in the world if Florida were a country. FPL is responsible for keeping the lights on for approximately $2 billion per day of Florida's GDP. These long-term growth prospects coupled with investment opportunities and renewables and transmission and distribution infrastructure enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition and support our belief that FPL is the highest quality rate regulatory utility in the country. Energy Resources' deep expertise in renewables and transmission serves as a key differentiator with customers. As a result of our data-driven development playbook, Energy Resources had a record year of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 9, 000 megawatts to our backlog. Driven in part by the roughly 5, 600 megawatts placed in service in 2023, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings almost 13% versus 2022. Energy Resources continues to see strong demand and is well positioned to realize its development expectations over the four year period ending 2026. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of the range, Energy Resources will be operating a roughly 63 gigawatt renewable portfolio by the end of 2026. That would be larger than the installed renewables capacity of all but nine countries. Energy Resources also is extending its excellent track record of optimizing our existing footprint to create additional shareholder value. To date, we have repowered six gigawatts of our existing 24 gigawatt wind operating fleet, investing roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources' wind footprint could be roughly 32 gigawatts, and with over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering, it represents a great opportunity set. We believe there are multiple opportunities to drive value from the existing footprint, multiple wind repowers, adding solar underneath existing wind and locating battery storage with existing wind and solar. And we have dedicated teams leveraging our development playbook to optimize our existing and future fleet. We can maximize existing land, permits, interconnection capacity, and operations to provide enhanced value to customers and shareholders. By 2026, Energy Resources could operate up to 53 gigawatts of generation with the potential to co-locate battery storage, which represents a great long-term opportunity, especially considering the likely future capacity needs of customers. Throughout 2023, Energy Resources also continue to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business. As growth and renewables occur throughout the U.S., there is a growing imperative to build additional or upgrade existing transmission. 2023 was a record year for our competitive transmission business. NextEra Energy transmission was awarded projects to construct transmission in PJM, CAISO and SPP that would roughly double the investments made in the existing business. We anticipate deploying approximately $1.9 billion of capital through 2027 to complete these transmission projects, which we estimate could enable up to 12 gigawatts of new renewables. Beyond 2026, Energy Resources is strategically positioned to benefit significantly from the irreversible shift towards electrification. With renewables only comprising roughly 16% of the U.S. generating mix, Energy Resources is just getting started. Renewable penetration is expected to double to over 30% by 2030, and Energy Resources is ready. We have a substantial development pipeline, including roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions for new renewables and storage projects. We believe Energy Resources has the most comprehensive renewable energy business in the world and is better positioned than ever to capitalize on long-term growth prospects. FPL and Energy Resources individually have executed well, delivering value for our customers, both businesses complement each other, push one another to be better, and together create scale and foster innovation. We have one of the sectors strongest balance sheets and constructed and placed in the service roughly 6, 800 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects in 2023. To put that into context, 6, 800 megawatts of installed U.S. renewable generating capacity is enough on its own to rank as the fourth largest U.S. renewable energy company and the 14th largest utility. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnership's transition plans and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. Last September, we made the tough decision to reduce the target distribution growth rate to 6% when NextEra Energy Partners no longer benefited from a competitive cost to capital. With a growth rate now comparable to its peers, we are focused on the partnership's cost to capital improving, which is critical for its future success. Towards that end, we are evaluating alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financings with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. We are executing against the transition plans and with the closing of the Texas Pipeline portfolio sale, the partnership has addressed two of the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financings. The STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing has been extinguished and we have sufficient proceeds available to complete the NEP Renewables to buyouts that are due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect the need and acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth and LP distributions per unit target and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. We are executing against the growth plans and have identified approximately 985 megawatts of wind repowers through 2026 making progress against our expectations. As we turn the page on 2023 and head into 2024, we are optimistic about the renewable sector, about our opportunity set, about customer demand, and about NextEra Energy's future. Demand for renewables has never been stronger, and yet the challenges have never been more complex, making the stakes even higher for customers. Our scale and competitive advantages are enabling us to be the partner of choice with both power and commercial and industrial customers. On March 14th, we will discuss Energy Resources development process in greater detail at our Development Investor event in Juno Beach and illustrate how our proprietary tools differentiate Energy Resources with customers. And then on June 11th, we will hold our NextEra Energy Investor Day in New York to discuss our long-term plans for both Energy Resources and FPL. Our optimism for NextEra Energy's future flows from the strength of our two world class businesses, FPL and Energy Resources, that leverage our scale and competitive advantages to differentiate themselves as leaders. Our optimism is driven from our proven playbooks of deploying capital and renewables and transmission to create value for customers. But I am most optimistic because we have spent the last two decades building a world class team at NextEra Energy, and it is, by far, our greatest competitive strength. Our team lives and breathes a culture of continuous improvement working together to solve the tough challenges of the day. We drive innovation relying on data analytics and automation to make better decisions, and we have developed and deployed smart, low cost, clean energy solutions that lead our industry. Most importantly, our team remains hyper focused on continuing our long track record of execution, serving our customers with excellence and providing long term value for shareholders. With that let me turn it over to Kirk who will review the 2023 results in more detail. And Shahr, this is John, just adding on to that again, on the repowers. Just like we do at the, I mean, just think about it as tax equity and project finance. And again, the private capital raises provide us with a number of options, but we're looking at a lot of different alternatives, that being one of them. Yes, thanks for the question, Shahr. So let me just take those in order. First of all, there's no update. We have not been contacted by the FEC. And I think just to remind investors of the timing, first of all, these are just guidelines I'm going to give you. I mean, there is no prescribed timeline in terms of the FEC providing a response to us. But as you may recall, we originally received the FEC complaint, I guess is what you would call it, that had been filed by a group called CREW back in November of 2022. And if you follow the historical precedent of the FEC, it's usually 12 to 18 months after you first are notified of a complaint having been filed, that you would learn whether or not the FEC decides to find that there's reason to believe that they ought to conduct an investigation. We have not heard anything from the FEC in that regard. The second thing I would remind investors of is this is not material again these were five allegations totaling political contributions of roughly $1.3 million to $1.5 million. So we're talking about smaller dollar amounts and how and when we would update investors would depend on what exactly we hear from the FEC. Sure, Steve. Let me go ahead and take that, this is John. First of all in the 21 years I've been at the company, as we've changed administrations and we've seen changes in Congress, we've never seen a change or appeal of tax credits. No matter what form they've taken, IRA is the form we're talking about here. So that's the first point I would make. Second, it's really hard to overturn existing law. I think Obamacare is a very good example of that. It's just very difficult no matter what the political wins are. The third point I would make is that the IRA benefits both sides of the aisle. It certainly is advantageous for obvious reasons for Democrats, but it also has a big benefit to Republicans. Because if you think about where the investments are being made around IRA and where a lot of the benefit of IRA is flowing, it's flowing to Republican states and it's flowing to parts of those states that are really difficult to stimulate economically. And we're talking about rural communities in these states. And so when we come in and we build a wind project, we build a solar project, we build a battery storage project, it's a complete turnaround for these communities. We're providing an economic base in the form of jobs. We're providing an economic base in the form of spending that occurs in that community. We're providing an economic base in the form of property taxes and sales tax revenues. These are 180s for these rural communities and make a huge difference on their viability going forward. Just think about hospitals and staffing doctors at county hospitals or teach -- paying teacher salaries. I mean, the property tax revenues have significant benefits. And so for those reasons, we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle. So see any repeal of IRAs being unlikely."

NextEra Energy delivered strong third-quarter results, growing adjusted earnings per share approximately 10.6% year-over-year. In the quarter, FPL continued to deliver outstanding value to its customers in what we believe has been one of the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the nation. FPL's bills are well below the national average, and we are relentlessly focused on reliability and running the business efficiently. Energy Resources extended its leadership position in renewable energy during the third quarter with strong adjusted earnings growth and its best renewables and storage origination quarter in its history. NextEra Energy has clear growth visibility through FPL's capital plan and Energy Resources' over 21 gigawatt renewables and storage backlog. With the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships, we believe NextEra Energy has both significant access to capital and cost-of-capital advantages and is well positioned to continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now let's turn to FPL's detailed results. For the third quarter of 2023, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 13.6% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full-year 2023 capital investments to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion. For the 12 months ending September 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the third quarter, we reversed roughly $245 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of over $1.2 billion. Over the current four-year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL to make capital investments of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Our capital investment plan is well-established and focused on enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains healthy and Florida continues to be one of the fastest-growing states in the country. FPL's third-quarter retail sales increased 3% from the prior year-comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage for customer of approximately 2%. As a result, FPL observed solid underlying growth in third quarter retail sales of roughly 1% on a weather normalized basis. Now let's turn to energy resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 21% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.11 per share year-over-year, while our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, which includes the impact of weaker year-over-year wind resource. The comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.04 per share and $0.01 per share respectively. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs by $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy resources had a record quarter of new renewables and storage origination at approximately 3,245 megawatts to the backlog, which is the first time we have exceeded three gigawatts in a single quarter. Although we will remind you that signings can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, we do believe this is a terrific sign of strong underlying demand for new renewable generation. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 21 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1,025 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our second quarter call. We also removed roughly 1,180 megawatts from our backlog, including roughly 800 megawatts of projects in New York following an adverse decision by NYSERDA two weeks ago. We are optimistic that these projects will ultimately move forward, but are removing them from backlog for now. The remaining megawatts were removed due to permitting challenges. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our renewable development expectations of roughly 33 gigawatts to 42 gigawatts through 2026. This quarter's backlog additions include roughly 455 megawatts to repower existing wind facilities, which includes energy resources share of approximately 740 megawatts of repowers within the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, which I'm going to discuss in a few minutes. As a reminder, in a repower, we invest roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build, are able to refresh and enhance the performance of the turbine equipment, and start a new 10 years of production tax credits, collectively resulting in attractive returns. Energy Resources has previously repowered roughly 6 gigawatts of its approximately 23 gigawatt operating wind portfolio, and we believe we will be able to repower much of our existing wind portfolio in the coming years. Also included in the backlog additions are roughly 250 megawatts of standalone battery storage projects co-located with existing wind and solar facilities. The combination of the standalone storage tax credit and the ability to utilize existing interconnection capacity from our operating renewables and storage footprint positions us well to serve our customers' growing needs for capacity. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 through 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range, and we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year for at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveats. Going forward, we plan to fund the business in a manner similar to how we have historically done so at both FPL and Energy Resources. This includes utilizing cash flow from operations for roughly half of our funding needs, in addition to tax equity, project finance, and corporate debt. The sale of tax credits is serving as a new source of capital funding for NextEra Energy. We expect to transfer roughly $400 million in tax credits in 2023 and expect this amount to grow over the next couple of years to approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in 2026. This dynamic has reduced NextEra Energy's capital recycling needs, including those previously met via sales to NextEra Energy partners, which has historically averaged roughly $1 billion of annual cash proceeds. Let me address future equity issuances specifically. Our balance sheet and financial discipline remain core to our strategy. As we find attractive investments for our customers and shareholders, we expect to fund those investments in a way that maintains the strength of our balance sheet. As a reminder, over the last five years, we have issued roughly $1.5 billion annually on average of equity in the form of equity units. We do not expect to issue any equity for the balance of 2023 and expect our year-end credit metrics to exceed those specified by the agencies to support our current ratings. From 2024 through 2026, we would expect our total equity needs to be no more than $3 billion in total with continued reliance on equity units to satisfy our equity needs, which have no dilution for the first three years. We believe FPL and Energy Resources are well-positioned to manage interest rate volatility in the current environment. At FPL, we primarily rely on the surplus mechanism to offset higher interest rates for the benefit of customers. In addition, FPL's rate agreement already provided for an ROE adjustment to 11.8%, enabling it to earn a higher ROE in the current higher rate environment. We expect that FPL will be able to absorb much and potentially all of the cumulative effects of the current interest rate environment through the use of the surplus mechanism over the remaining settlement period. Consistent with the expiration of the current rate agreement, FPL expects to file a rate case in early 2025 for new rates effective 2026. For Energy Resources and corporate and other, we now have $20.5 billion of interest rate hedges in place. While the amounts vary as we add and settle hedges, the tenor of the swaps are between five years and ten years and have a weighted average rate of roughly 3.75%. Swaps allow us to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on energy resources backlog returns and capital holdings $12.8 billion of debt maturities from 2024 through 2026. Specifically, these swaps allow us to hedge the project-level debt funding we expect to issue on our renewables backlog as well as a portion of the $12.8 billion of the term maturities. To put this all in perspective, NextEra Energy's sensitivity for an immediate 50 basis point upward shift in the yield curve has essentially no expected adjusted EPS impact on 2023 and 2024 and has on average $0.03 to $0.05 of expected adjusted EPS impact in 2025 and 2026, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of our adjusted EPS expectations. This sensitivity, of course, assumes we do not implement other offsetting initiatives, including among others, our normal process of cost reductions and capital efficiency opportunities. Our backlog is in good shape and is benefiting from our interest rate swaps, global supply chain management capabilities, and the ability to procure equipment, materials and balance of plant services at scale across our portfolio. The expected returns on equity for our backlog are mid-teens for solar and over 20 for wind and storage. As we have done historically, we price our power purchase agreements commensurate with current market conditions, including our current cost of capital in order to maintain appropriate returns. In addition, at the time of our final investment decision, before we commit significant capital to our backlog projects, we are utilizing interest rate swaps on contracts that we were entered into when rates were lower to maintain our return expectations. We remain financially disciplined and pass on projects that don't meet our return expectations. Going forward, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in lower equipment pricing for solar panels and batteries, given increased competition globally, and declining prices for materials, which we believe will help offset the impacts of higher interest rates on power purchase agreement prices. We are optimistic that demand will remain resilient due to the factors you all know well, including the continued cost competitiveness of renewable energy, relative to alternative forms of generation. Importantly to date, demand has remained strong, as evidenced by our substantial new additions to backlog this quarter. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. As a reminder, the partnership is a financing vehicle that grows its distribution by acquiring assets with long-term contracted high-quality cash flows and financing those acquisitions at low cost. Over the years, NextEra Energy Partners has been able to rely on low-cost financing to help drive its distribution growth. To meet its financing needs in recent years, the partnership has relied primarily on convertible equity portfolio financing that have a low cash coupon during their term and convert into equity over time. A significant amount of the equity required to be issued to buy out these financings began coming due this year and over the next several years, which we believe contributed to the partnership's trading yield almost doubling at the same time interest rates were rising. Consequently, the partnership's cost of capital increased, which made it difficult to support a 12% growth rate in a way that is sustainable and in the best interest of unit holders over the long term. By reducing the growth rate to 6%, NextEra Energy Partners LP distribution rate is now comparable to its peers, and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In order to meet these objectives, the partnership is focused on first executing against its transition plan. As a reminder, the transition plans include successfully entering into agreement to sell the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio and natural gas pipeline assets this year and in 2025, respectively. Doing so will enable the partnership to address the equity buyouts associated with the FPL's midstream, the 2019 NEP pipelines and NEP renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing through 2025. Through the period of our current financial expectations, that would leave a small equity buyout of roughly $147 million on the genesis holding convertible equity portfolio financing in 2026. The partnership is continuing its process to sell the Texas pipeline portfolio and expects to have an update on or before our fourth quarter call in January. NextEra Energy Partners is focused on executing against its growth plan for unit holders. That plan involves organic growth, specifically repowering of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects, as well as acquiring assets from energy resources or third parties at favorable yields. Importantly, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth in distributions per unit target. Today, we're announcing plans to repower approximately 740 megawatts of wind facilities through 2026, which require the final approval of the customer's [ph] board of directors, which is expected to be received in the near term. The repowerings are projected to generate attractive CAFD yields and the partnership expects to fund the repowerings with either tax equity or project-specific debt. Repowerings represent an efficient way to support the partnership's growth targets. Overall, we are pleased with this progress and remain focused on executing additional repowering opportunities in the future across NextEra Energy Partners' roughly 8-gigawatt wind portfolio. To minimize the volatility associated with the changes in interest rates and support the growth plan, the partnership also executed roughly $1.9 billion to hedge refinancing costs for the 2024 and 2025 maturities. The resulting expected refinancing costs of the maturities are factored into our expectations. Turning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners' third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $488 million and cash available for distribution was $247 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 1,100 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2022 and the approximately the 690 net megawatts of new projects that closed in the second quarter of this year, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $32 million of cash available for distribution. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year. Third quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were positively impacted by the incentive distribution rights fee suspension and provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter, more than offsetting the cash available for distribution impacts of lower pay-go payments driven by lower wind resource at existing projects. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of 86.75 cents per common unit or $3.47 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its second quarter 2023 distribution per common unit. From a base of our second quarter 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.42, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per unit per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year, being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. For 2023, we expect an annualized rate for the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be $3.52 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023 to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. The adjusted EBITDA and related cash available for distributions associated with the Texas Pipeline portfolio have been excluded from these run rate financial expectations. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveat. While NextEra Energy Partners navigates through this current environment, it's important not to lose sight of the value of the underlying portfolio. NextEra Energy Partners is the seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and the sun in the world, with over 10 gigawatts of renewables in operation. The partnership owns renewable projects that deliver high-quality cash flows in 30 states, serving 94 customers with an average counterparty credit rating of BBB plus via contracts with an average remaining contract life of 14 years. We remain optimistic the partnership can be an attractive vehicle to own existing renewable assets over the long term. We want the partnership to be successful, and separately, to address a question we've been receiving from some investors, NextEra Energy has no plans to buy back NextEra Energy Partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to John.\nJohn Ketchum: Thanks, Kirk. Let me briefly address NextEra Energy Partners. It's been a difficult year, and we have a lot of work to do. As Kirk shared, we are focused on executing against our transition plans and look forward to providing an update on the Texas Pipeline portfolio sales process on or before the fourth quarter earnings call. We are also focused on delivering LP distribution growth of 6% through at least 2026, and the repowerings we announced today are a good start towards achieving that objective. At NextEra Energy, our foundations are rooted in FPL, the nation's largest electric utility, and NextEra Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables. Both businesses have performed very well, complement each other, and push one another to be even better. This is validated by the solid financial and operating results both continue to deliver and the excellent progress we are making against our development expectations. Over recent weeks, we met with many of our investors and have welcomed your feedback. In response, we addressed many of the questions we heard from you in our remarks today and in the presentation materials you now have. Along those lines, I want to reiterate the solid fundamentals on which NextEra Energy is built and our outstanding prospects for future growth, having just completed our annual strategy review process with our board of directors. FPL remains among the best utilities in the United States, achieving top operational performance across key metrics while maintaining the industry's lowest cost structure, one of the cleanest emissions profiles, and a customer bill that is roughly 30% lower than the national average. It is located in one of the fastest growing states with what we believe is one of the country's most constructive regulatory environments. FPL has by far the lowest non-fuel O&M of any large utility in the nation. Over the last 20 years, our relentless focus on cost, efficiency and low bills have saved customers nearly $15 billion in fuel cost alone. Year after year, FPL receives top accolades for reliability, despite operating on a peninsula and historically facing a high probability for hurricanes. It has plans to add approximately 20 gigawatts of solar over the next 10 years for the benefit of its customers while undergrounding its distribution system to lower operating costs and withstand the impacts of hurricanes to help keep the Florida economy, which is now the 16th largest in the world, running on all cylinders. We believe FPL is the highest quality regulated utility in the country. At Energy Resources, we are just getting started. Renewable penetration as part of the US generating mix currently stands at roughly 16% and is expected to double, reaching over 30% by 2030. As the world's leader in renewable energy with an approximately 20% market share in US renewables origination, Energy Resources stands to benefit significantly from the unstoppable shift towards electrification. Experience and scale matter, and with over 20 years of renewables experience, a 31 gigawatt operating portfolio, a development pipeline of roughly 300 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects, and roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions we are well positioned for future growth. In addition to our scale and competitive advantages that you all know well, our ability to finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector provides us with an access to and cost of capital advantage. We believe all of this enables us to differentiate ourselves in a complex macro environment to build even more renewables at attractive returns. In short, we believe Energy Resources has built the most competitive and complete renewable energy business in the world and is in a better position than ever to lead the decarbonization of the US economy. We have spent the last two decades building a world-class clean energy platform powered by our greatest strength, our people, and a culture of continuous improvement that drives innovation and smart clean energy solutions. I want to extend my appreciation to our team today as we remain committed to serving our customers and providing long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, and now we welcome your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah, hi. Thank you. So just a couple questions; first on the slide on the tax transferability and the billion dollars effectively creating $6.5 billion of equity content, could you just talk to that more and just, I think if I do the backward math, that's about a 15% FFO to debt kind of calculation. Is that kind of what you're using to get to that, or is there more nuance to it?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, Steve, on that slide, I'll take that. This is John. We are -- the example is a $1 dollars. You take a $1 dollars, you divide by the 18% FFO to debt, that gets you about $5.5 billion. You add the $1 billion of cash that you receive, and that gets you the $6.5 billion of equity content on a $1 billion transfer.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. And when you lay out your, that would seem to be a key part, since you talked about the transferability numbers going from $400 million to a $1.7 billion. That's a key part, and that would show up in your funding plan in the corporate debt issuances now, since it's not tax equity anymore. That might be kind of matched against that, or would it be in the tax equity and project? How do we think about where that shows up?\nJohn Ketchum: The way I think about it is it's going to show up in your cash flow from operations. That's the cash that you actually receive, and then there's also some equity content that benefits the rest of the sources, including corporate debt issuances.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then one other question on the -- so the tenor of the interest rate swap seems pretty long, which is helpful. Just, when we think of how you're using the swaps to kind of basically limit interest rate risk of the projects, how much project, if there's a $1 billion of a project, how much is project debt going forward, percent of that, let's say, that you might be using a swap against?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, the way I think about it, Steve, it's 70%. So, when you think about our backlog, just some rough math, if you take the $20.5 billion, I would think about roughly $15.5 billion of that or so going against the backlog, and then the balance going against near-term maturities that we have through 2026. But the interest rate sensitivity that we have given you includes our exposure on everything, right? So, on the project debt, on the corporate debt issuances, it includes it all.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one overall question on the renewables environment; maybe you could just talk to, just a little more color on what you're seeing, because there's been a general view that the higher cost of capital environment's really slowing, renewables growth and I just, maybe just more color on what you're seeing, and is there going to be a slowdown that comes next quarter because of the move up, or just more color on the overall environment would be helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, Steve, I'm going to turn it over to Rebecca. But one thing I would say is the renewable business is increasingly moving more and more towards the scale players, and you can see reasons why. One of them is the ability to have a balance sheet to actually enter into the kind of interest rate hedges that we can enter into. If you can't do that, that really puts you at a significant disadvantage. And then all the other competitive advantages that you're all aware of, where, we buy at scale, we build at scale, we operate at scale. And the last point I want to make is the cost of capital advantage. In today's market environment, having a strong balance sheet with an ultimate parent with an A-minus rating is really, really important, and a super big competitive advantage that we have over the smaller developers that we compete against and that's a big part of our success. But let me turn it over to Rebecca to talk more about what she's seeing in the market.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Steve. So, we are thrilled with the signings that we posted for this quarter. Obviously, Kirk highlighted that 3.2 gigawatts is a record for us. It's specifically the first time we've been over three gigawatts and it represents, all the things that I think you would want to see, which is strong returns across the portfolio, a great mix of technologies, a good mix of customer type that we signed and entered into these agreements, and also a mix of signings in terms of the date and across those technologies. There were -- our first additions to the backlog in 2027, I actually think it is slightly disproportionate to what we're seeing in terms of our overall backlog and a strong pipeline of projects that we see going into the fourth quarter, which are far more weighted to a little bit in '24 and a lot more in '25 and '26, but we're really excited about it. So, really strong and exciting development pipeline and I'll echo John's comments and it's really what we're seeing on the ground, that after some weariness over the last couple of years, our customers are really, drawn to us for our ability to execute. They understand the pipeline that we're building and the resources that we bring to bear to get projects successfully built and I think that increasingly matters and we're going to continue to address it quarterly. But, all signs are very positive for what I'm seeing today.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Steve.#\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys. Just maybe quickly touching on the embedded expectations for NEP, I guess in terms of the Texas pipeline sale, John, are there any more comprehensive updates on the process? And I guess, are you anticipating any delays or challenges in light of the market conditions and kind of the reason why I ask is there's obviously a theory out there or a thesis that you're having a little bit of an issue offloading these assets. So, I'd love to maybe if you can give a little bit more color and anticipation of your full disclosures.\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, sure. Thank you. Let me start by saying, obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, our focus is on selling these pipes, growing at 6% and putting NEP in a position to succeed going forward. So, along those lines, we continue to work very diligently on the sales process. We're working with counterparties to get it done. And at the same time, look, this is a little bit more of a challenging macroeconomic environment. These are very valuable pipes and we are looking for a transaction that maximizes value for unit holders and we're going to continue to be disciplined. But in terms of the progress that we're making, things are continuing to advance and move forward and we look forward to having a further update either on the fourth quarter call or sometime before that in terms of where we are.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just John, do you anticipate the repowering to sort of fully offset the repowers pipeline sale in '25?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hey, Shahriar, it's Rebecca, I'll take that one. So, we're super excited about repowers as part of the longer-term growth plan within NEP. And with such an extensive pipeline of renewable projects, to pursue these repowers, it'll be a nice complement to continuing to acquire assets. So, it doesn't meet the entire growth plan, but certainly is a nice part of it. As we talked about in May, we have a total of 1.3 gigawatts that we see in the near term. And obviously, this is a first step forward in order to make progress on that. So, attractive CAFD yields, as we noted, there's still some steps to finish. But we're also not done with the opportunities repower other assets in the portfolio.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just lastly for me, just on the sources and uses of cash, I think we all really appreciate the enhanced disclosures there. I guess, obviously, given the capital-intensive nature of the business, do you anticipate any incremental levers to potentially offset the $3 billion of equity and $3 billion of asset sales if, the capital market conditions become a bit more challenged? I guess any reason to rethink around flexing the payout or the balance sheet metrics? Thanks, guys.\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah. Listen, thank you. Thank you, Shahriar and obviously, we are very, very focused, as always on costs. We're very, very focused on capital productivity and efficiency as well. So, those are two levers we always have and I think our shareholder base is very familiar with the success that we've had in our annual cost reduction processes that we run across the company. But those are certainly point of focus for us and look, when I think about the $3 billion of equity and the $3 billion of asset recycling, if you look historically at what we've been able to do, I'd be pretty disappointed if we can only do $3 billion of asset recycling, not only through NEP, but third parties and as a reminder, over the last three or four years, we've been very successful in selling renewable projects, not only to NEP, but to third parties. Think about the OTPP transaction, the Apollo transaction, the KKR transaction. So, we feel very good about our sources plan that we've laid out and look forward to executing against it.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Congrats.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I'm wondering if, you mentioned returns, over 20% returns for storage and wind. I think that's higher than you've indicated in the past and assuming that's driven by higher PPA pricing, was wondering if you're seeing, just given higher PPA prices, any impacts to demand in the renewables market here? And how you think about that level of return in terms of whether it's sustainable, given the competitive dynamics in those end markets? Thanks.\nRebecca Kujawa: Dave, I'll take that. As you know, we've always characterized the backdrop for renewables as a competitive environment. So, I'm very proud of how this team, our team, is executed across an ever-changing environment. And I certainly think it's a strength of our team and most importantly, the competitive advantages that John has highlighted, investment over a long period of time, the ability to work with our supply chain, the ability to work with the folks that we partner with to build the projects and ultimately operate these projects well over time. So, I think that really contributes to our ability to maintain appropriate returns and I also think it reflects what you expect us to do, which is adjust to all of the current costs of both building, financing and operating projects over time and we believe that we are successfully able to achieve that. In terms of demand, obviously, we can't fully predict the future, but I can tell you that the two data points that I think are really top of mind and illustrated from our report today is 3.2 gigawatts is a fantastic sign I think, of demand. And as I highlighted a minute ago to Steve's question, a good underlying foundation of technology, dates, locations, etcetera. So, I'm really pleased and also, in looking at the pipeline for the fourth quarter, obviously, this is a development business. Things can change. But I believe that we're in a good position to continue realizing strong demand, particularly in that 24 timeframe to 26 timeframe. So, based on what we see today, very exciting and I think it's founded on the things that you all know well, which is a backdrop of increasing electrification, increasing demand for generation and capacity value across our sector, and renewables continuing to be the least cost form of generation. So, I would hope you would expect what I would argue is the best position company to execute well against an environment like that.\nDavid Arcaro: Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And I was also curious on the tax credit transfers market. Could you touch on what you're seeing in terms of demand and interest from counterparties? How deep is that market and what level of pricing that you're realizing when you're transferring these credits as it becomes a more important source of cash flow over the next few years?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, Dave, I'll take that question. First of all, I would argue, we have an outstanding tax department. And our tax department, yeah, together with our treasury group started early and we've already reached out to 50 of the top U.S. taxpayers in our building relationships and have had terrific execution against our '23 plan. The demand is extremely robust for tax credit transfers and we're already working on '24 as we speak, having '23 pretty much behind us. And one of the things that really helps NextEra and the tax transfer market is the fact that we have a strong balance sheet. We have an A minus rate from the parent and we're able to underwrite the credit. And being able to underwrite the credit is really, really important because we compete against a lot of really small developers that can't, that if you go to the top 50 taxpayers, they've never heard of these companies. They don't know who they are. They don't really know what they do. They know NextEra and we can provide an indemnity behind the tax credit that we transfer. It sleeves off our vest, so to speak, to be able to do that and we get preferred pricing because of it and so I feel great about where things stand in terms of our tax credit transfer program.\nRebecca Kujawa: And I'd love to add one point on that because I think it's a great complement to our broader business and particularly the C&I customers that we're working with to actually buy some of the renewable energy. Some of the customers that are most active in the market in procuring renewable energy are also the ones that are most interested in buying tax credits from us and I think they really like the value proposition, certainly of the economics, as John highlighted, but really like the value proposition supporting and enabling investment in renewable projects. So we see a really deep market, a lot of interest, and really a lot of cross-selling opportunities across the portfolio.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Appreciate all the color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, just going back to the last question a bit, how do you think about the composition of the $25 billion to $35 billion of project tax equity and tax credit transferability, how do you think about your existing tax equity commitments, and how do you think about some of the impacts from a regulatory perspective on the tax equity market? Obviously, you're talking about a robust start to the tax credit transferability. How much does it matter? How much does it play into that $25 billion to $35 billion, and ultimately, how much TE is contemplated anyway in that range, if you will?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, I'll go ahead and take that, Julien. First of all, when you look at our tax equity project finance split, things can move around. Let's just hypothetically think about it as kind of 50-50. I think that might be a decent starting place to think about and we feel very good about our ability to be able to access tax equity. the regulatory issues, I think, that you pointed out, I think, are going to get resolved. I think there were some unintended consequences around Basel III, and we have had significant discussions with the folks involved. On those issues, the administration certainly thinks this was an unintended consequence, as do, I think, folks at the Fed and the administration, I think, is very focused on trying to get a good resolution around it. But, I don't worry about it too much at the end of the day for us. I think the Basel III thing gets fixed and, worst-case scenario, the banks will find other pockets to be able to issue tax equity. We'll be issue -- we'll receive our allocation off the top of the deck like we always do. And, these relationships that I just spoke about with corporate parties, these 50 folks or so that we've been dealing with, there's no reason they can't step in and provide tax equity financing. And we'll be talking to them about those structures as well and then transferability, which we've already spent some time talking about this morning, can fill any gap. So long story short, we feel terrific about our ability to source tax equity financing going forward.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So transferability is not technically part of the $25 billion to $35 billion, but obviously it's a fluid conversation, right, if I understand that piece.\nJohn Ketchum: Can you say that again, Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: The transferability, the credit transferability, technically not included in that $25 billion to $35 billion as it stands, but it's a fluid question of how you finance going forward.\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah. The tax transferability is not in that number. Again, it shows up in cash flow from operations and then the equity content that's created really shows up in that corporate debt issuance line, but look at the corporate-the cash flow from operations in terms of the dollars that we're receiving for tax credit transfers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. And then just quickly, if I can, on the interest rate question here, thank you again for the additional sensitivities and disclosures here. How do you think about sort of a baseline and the open impact as you roll to kind of 2026? I think it's notable, for instance, you guys reaffirmed through that period with your usual commentary. How do you think about sort of the puts and takes as you roll into that longer dated '26 period, considering the roll off of the hedges here in that, I think, period more specifically, if you will? Is there a way to kind of quantify the interest rate kind of head one?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah. So a couple of points I'll make. One is you've seen the sensitivity. So zero impact in '23 or '24, $0.03 to $0.05 in '25 and '26. With the five year to 10 year tenors, with the average coupon 375 basis points, we feel very good about the protection that we have there. We've talked about where FPL sits. And then you think about the project financings that we entered into. We use those hedges. Those project financings are basically 20 year amortizing debt that have 20 year hedges that then get rolled into them that have the benefit of those swaps and so when you think about our existing project finance portfolio that we have, there's another $4 billion of interest rate swaps that aren't even in the $20.5 billion that we mentioned to you today that protect and safeguard those as they roll and do. So long story short, between the $20.5 billion that we have against the backlog the fact that our existing portfolio is already locked in and hedged, we feel very good about our interest rate exposure.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. All right, guys. Thank you very much. I'll pass it there. Have a nice one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate the incremental disclosure on the funding plan and the asset sales and just to follow up there. Are renewables the only element kind of embedded in that $3 billion in proceeds, or are there any other non-core assets and energy resources that you'd consider monetizing?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah. So when I think about it, Carly, renewables come top of mind. We've had a history over the last several years of being able to recycle capital through renewables. But remember, too, we're a large company. There are other assets that could potentially be available for capital recycling that are non-core. The FCG transaction that we just recently announced is a good example of that and we'll always look for opportunities. If there are situations where third parties value assets more than we do, then sure, we'll look to be opportunistic, but it's not a core part of the plan.\nCarly Davenport: Got it. Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just as you think about the timing cadence of the backlog additions and also the dispersion across the different technologies, I think, Rebecca, you alluded to the fact that the 4Q pipeline is shaping up to be kind of more weighted to the '24 timeframe to '26 timeframe versus this quarter being a little bit longer dated. But can you also just talk about the split across wind, solar, and storage? It seems like there's been step up in solar relative to wind. So just any thoughts on how you see that piece evolving going forward would be helpful.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Carly. It's a great question. Yes, I definitely support that first part of your comment. And it's consistent with what I had said before that I think this quarter was a little bit anomalous in terms of the waiting to 2027 and the pipeline is very much more weighted for what I see today for '24, '25, and '26, with much of it in the '25 and '26 timeframe, just given the fact that we're ending into '24. In terms of the technology, obviously, we had very strong findings for storage and as Kirk highlighted in the prepared remarks, in terms of the -- maybe not surprise is probably not the right word, but really pleased to see how we're starting to see adoption across a broader set of markets, not just California, but into the Midwest, where our utility customers and obviously some of the C&I are really valuing the ability to incorporate storage for capacity value and affirming and shaping the renewables product. So that's really positive in my mind. On the wind side, I think we're still seeing a little bit of dynamics that shaped up as a result of the tax credits that we originally we and the industry \u2013 thought were going to phase down after 2020. So we saw a significant amount of pull forward of demand. And I think that's still affecting the industry a little bit and then, obviously, the PTC being extended for solar significantly improved the economics from a relative standpoint, which has been super positive for demand. We still see a lot of geographies where wind is incredibly attractive and so I feel good about long-term demand for wind and I also feel really good about long-term demand for repowering projects. Obviously, we had a great start to the repowering initiative following the IRA extension with over 700 megawatts we talked about today. Obviously, its share for a year, it's a little bit less than that, but when you look across the entire tens of gigawatts now of renewable projects, there's lots of opportunities to repower as well. So overall, across the board, really excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us.\nCarly Davenport: That's great. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Weisel: Hey, good morning, everyone. First, a question. Can you talk a bit about supply chains? I'd be curious your latest thoughts on the availability and status of supply chains, both for solar equipment as well as for grid-level equipment like transformers or switchgears?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. Yeah, let me take that, Andrew. So, first of all, with supply chain, things are really improved a lot. As Rebecca just mentioned, we have the two issues, right? CERC convention, which has been asked and answered, provided a lot of clarity around what can be done, what can't, and with the Presidential Proclamation. So, in very good shape there. Second was forced labor and making sure that our suppliers are working constructively with Customs and Border Patrol to get their panels cleared for importation into the country. And so, for the most part all of our solar suppliers have been able to do that and so, we are in very good shape there. I think on grid power, I actually the grid-level issues that you just mentioned, we're in very good shape on. We had gone long on grid-level equipment, including transformers and so, we have a significant supply in our inventory and we've also looked forward in a plan for this in terms of trying to make sure that we have equipment available where if our customers or the transmission owner in the places that we're building renewables are short on equipment, are short on grid-level equipment in particular, that we have it in our inventory and are able to offer that up as a solution. And I think one of the big benefits that we have, given our scale and given our leverage and the ability to buy this equipment in very large quantities and really lock up a lot of the manufacturing lines for this equipment, it's a true competitive advantage for a renewable business the way I think about it.\nAndrew Weisel: Great. Just to clarify, NIR [ph] is buying this equipment, or FPL? Like, do you keep those separate inventories?\nJohn Ketchum: Both are. Both are because both need it.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, great. And one quick follow-up, if I may, I'm almost apologizing to bring this up. But the Florida State Supreme Court asked the PSU for some details on their approval of the rigged case settlement. Can you just share your expectations around timing of the process and maybe potential outcomes?\nArmando Pimentel: Hey, Andrew. It's Armando. You're right that the Supreme Court remanded the settlement agreement back to the Public Service Commission. Our view is that the Public Service Commission is going to take that up soon and will likely be in a position early next year, I would say first quarter of next year, to be able to send that back up to the Supreme Court with the additional details that the Supreme Court is looking forward to receiving. That process would be very similar to the process, both the timeline and the materials that the Public Service Commission went through with the Duke case that was remanded by the Supreme Court back to the Public Service Commission last year, where the Public Service Commission did not reopen the record. We don't expect our record to be reopened and made sure that they put together a conclusion that would be satisfactory in their view with the Supreme Court and send it back to the Supreme Court. So we think we're on the same process as that Duke case was, and we look forward to having the Public Service Commission resubmit that, again, first quarter of next year.\nAndrew Weisel: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thanks Kristin and good morning. NextEra Energy delivered strong third-quarter results, growing adjusted earnings per share approximately 10.6% year-over-year. In the quarter, FPL continued to deliver outstanding value to its customers in what we believe has been one of the most constructive regulatory jurisdictions in the nation. FPL's bills are well below the national average, and we are relentlessly focused on reliability and running the business efficiently. Energy Resources extended its leadership position in renewable energy during the third quarter with strong adjusted earnings growth and its best renewables and storage origination quarter in its history. NextEra Energy has clear growth visibility through FPL's capital plan and Energy Resources' over 21 gigawatt renewables and storage backlog. With the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships, we believe NextEra Energy has both significant access to capital and cost-of-capital advantages and is well positioned to continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now let's turn to FPL's detailed results. For the third quarter of 2023, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 13.6% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreement's four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.6 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full-year 2023 capital investments to be between $9 billion and $9.5 billion. For the 12 months ending September 2023, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the third quarter, we reversed roughly $245 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of over $1.2 billion. Over the current four-year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL to make capital investments of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Our capital investment plan is well-established and focused on enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry. Key indicators show that the Florida economy remains healthy and Florida continues to be one of the fastest-growing states in the country. FPL's third-quarter retail sales increased 3% from the prior year-comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage for customer of approximately 2%. As a result, FPL observed solid underlying growth in third quarter retail sales of roughly 1% on a weather normalized basis. Now let's turn to energy resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 21% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.11 per share year-over-year, while our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, which includes the impact of weaker year-over-year wind resource. The comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.04 per share and $0.01 per share respectively. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.08 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs by $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy resources had a record quarter of new renewables and storage origination at approximately 3,245 megawatts to the backlog, which is the first time we have exceeded three gigawatts in a single quarter. Although we will remind you that signings can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, we do believe this is a terrific sign of strong underlying demand for new renewable generation. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 21 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1,025 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our second quarter call. We also removed roughly 1,180 megawatts from our backlog, including roughly 800 megawatts of projects in New York following an adverse decision by NYSERDA two weeks ago. We are optimistic that these projects will ultimately move forward, but are removing them from backlog for now. The remaining megawatts were removed due to permitting challenges. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our renewable development expectations of roughly 33 gigawatts to 42 gigawatts through 2026. This quarter's backlog additions include roughly 455 megawatts to repower existing wind facilities, which includes energy resources share of approximately 740 megawatts of repowers within the NextEra Energy Partners portfolio, which I'm going to discuss in a few minutes. As a reminder, in a repower, we invest roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build, are able to refresh and enhance the performance of the turbine equipment, and start a new 10 years of production tax credits, collectively resulting in attractive returns. Energy Resources has previously repowered roughly 6 gigawatts of its approximately 23 gigawatt operating wind portfolio, and we believe we will be able to repower much of our existing wind portfolio in the coming years. Also included in the backlog additions are roughly 250 megawatts of standalone battery storage projects co-located with existing wind and solar facilities. The combination of the standalone storage tax credit and the ability to utilize existing interconnection capacity from our operating renewables and storage footprint positions us well to serve our customers' growing needs for capacity. Turning now to our third quarter 2023 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 through 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range, and we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year for at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveats. Going forward, we plan to fund the business in a manner similar to how we have historically done so at both FPL and Energy Resources. This includes utilizing cash flow from operations for roughly half of our funding needs, in addition to tax equity, project finance, and corporate debt. The sale of tax credits is serving as a new source of capital funding for NextEra Energy. We expect to transfer roughly $400 million in tax credits in 2023 and expect this amount to grow over the next couple of years to approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in 2026. This dynamic has reduced NextEra Energy's capital recycling needs, including those previously met via sales to NextEra Energy partners, which has historically averaged roughly $1 billion of annual cash proceeds. Let me address future equity issuances specifically. Our balance sheet and financial discipline remain core to our strategy. As we find attractive investments for our customers and shareholders, we expect to fund those investments in a way that maintains the strength of our balance sheet. As a reminder, over the last five years, we have issued roughly $1.5 billion annually on average of equity in the form of equity units. We do not expect to issue any equity for the balance of 2023 and expect our year-end credit metrics to exceed those specified by the agencies to support our current ratings. From 2024 through 2026, we would expect our total equity needs to be no more than $3 billion in total with continued reliance on equity units to satisfy our equity needs, which have no dilution for the first three years. We believe FPL and Energy Resources are well-positioned to manage interest rate volatility in the current environment. At FPL, we primarily rely on the surplus mechanism to offset higher interest rates for the benefit of customers. In addition, FPL's rate agreement already provided for an ROE adjustment to 11.8%, enabling it to earn a higher ROE in the current higher rate environment. We expect that FPL will be able to absorb much and potentially all of the cumulative effects of the current interest rate environment through the use of the surplus mechanism over the remaining settlement period. Consistent with the expiration of the current rate agreement, FPL expects to file a rate case in early 2025 for new rates effective 2026. For Energy Resources and corporate and other, we now have $20.5 billion of interest rate hedges in place. While the amounts vary as we add and settle hedges, the tenor of the swaps are between five years and ten years and have a weighted average rate of roughly 3.75%. Swaps allow us to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on energy resources backlog returns and capital holdings $12.8 billion of debt maturities from 2024 through 2026. Specifically, these swaps allow us to hedge the project-level debt funding we expect to issue on our renewables backlog as well as a portion of the $12.8 billion of the term maturities. To put this all in perspective, NextEra Energy's sensitivity for an immediate 50 basis point upward shift in the yield curve has essentially no expected adjusted EPS impact on 2023 and 2024 and has on average $0.03 to $0.05 of expected adjusted EPS impact in 2025 and 2026, which is equivalent to approximately 1% of our adjusted EPS expectations. This sensitivity, of course, assumes we do not implement other offsetting initiatives, including among others, our normal process of cost reductions and capital efficiency opportunities. Our backlog is in good shape and is benefiting from our interest rate swaps, global supply chain management capabilities, and the ability to procure equipment, materials and balance of plant services at scale across our portfolio. The expected returns on equity for our backlog are mid-teens for solar and over 20 for wind and storage. As we have done historically, we price our power purchase agreements commensurate with current market conditions, including our current cost of capital in order to maintain appropriate returns. In addition, at the time of our final investment decision, before we commit significant capital to our backlog projects, we are utilizing interest rate swaps on contracts that we were entered into when rates were lower to maintain our return expectations. We remain financially disciplined and pass on projects that don't meet our return expectations. Going forward, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing in lower equipment pricing for solar panels and batteries, given increased competition globally, and declining prices for materials, which we believe will help offset the impacts of higher interest rates on power purchase agreement prices. We are optimistic that demand will remain resilient due to the factors you all know well, including the continued cost competitiveness of renewable energy, relative to alternative forms of generation. Importantly to date, demand has remained strong, as evidenced by our substantial new additions to backlog this quarter. Now let's turn to NextEra Energy Partners. As a reminder, the partnership is a financing vehicle that grows its distribution by acquiring assets with long-term contracted high-quality cash flows and financing those acquisitions at low cost. Over the years, NextEra Energy Partners has been able to rely on low-cost financing to help drive its distribution growth. To meet its financing needs in recent years, the partnership has relied primarily on convertible equity portfolio financing that have a low cash coupon during their term and convert into equity over time. A significant amount of the equity required to be issued to buy out these financings began coming due this year and over the next several years, which we believe contributed to the partnership's trading yield almost doubling at the same time interest rates were rising. Consequently, the partnership's cost of capital increased, which made it difficult to support a 12% growth rate in a way that is sustainable and in the best interest of unit holders over the long term. By reducing the growth rate to 6%, NextEra Energy Partners LP distribution rate is now comparable to its peers, and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In order to meet these objectives, the partnership is focused on first executing against its transition plan. As a reminder, the transition plans include successfully entering into agreement to sell the Texas natural gas pipeline portfolio and natural gas pipeline assets this year and in 2025, respectively. Doing so will enable the partnership to address the equity buyouts associated with the FPL's midstream, the 2019 NEP pipelines and NEP renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing through 2025. Through the period of our current financial expectations, that would leave a small equity buyout of roughly $147 million on the genesis holding convertible equity portfolio financing in 2026. The partnership is continuing its process to sell the Texas pipeline portfolio and expects to have an update on or before our fourth quarter call in January. NextEra Energy Partners is focused on executing against its growth plan for unit holders. That plan involves organic growth, specifically repowering of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects, as well as acquiring assets from energy resources or third parties at favorable yields. Importantly, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition in 2024 to meet the 6% growth in distributions per unit target. Today, we're announcing plans to repower approximately 740 megawatts of wind facilities through 2026, which require the final approval of the customer's [ph] board of directors, which is expected to be received in the near term. The repowerings are projected to generate attractive CAFD yields and the partnership expects to fund the repowerings with either tax equity or project-specific debt. Repowerings represent an efficient way to support the partnership's growth targets. Overall, we are pleased with this progress and remain focused on executing additional repowering opportunities in the future across NextEra Energy Partners' roughly 8-gigawatt wind portfolio. To minimize the volatility associated with the changes in interest rates and support the growth plan, the partnership also executed roughly $1.9 billion to hedge refinancing costs for the 2024 and 2025 maturities. The resulting expected refinancing costs of the maturities are factored into our expectations. Turning to the detailed results, NextEra Energy Partners' third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $488 million and cash available for distribution was $247 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 1,100 net megawatts of new long-term contracted renewable projects acquired in 2022 and the approximately the 690 net megawatts of new projects that closed in the second quarter of this year, contributed approximately $66 million of adjusted EBITDA and $32 million of cash available for distribution. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects increased by approximately $5 million year-over-year. Third quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were positively impacted by the incentive distribution rights fee suspension and provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter, more than offsetting the cash available for distribution impacts of lower pay-go payments driven by lower wind resource at existing projects. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of 86.75 cents per common unit or $3.47 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its second quarter 2023 distribution per common unit. From a base of our second quarter 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.42, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per unit per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year, being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. For 2023, we expect an annualized rate for the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be $3.52 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023 to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million, respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. The adjusted EBITDA and related cash available for distributions associated with the Texas Pipeline portfolio have been excluded from these run rate financial expectations. As always, our expectations are subject to our caveat. While NextEra Energy Partners navigates through this current environment, it's important not to lose sight of the value of the underlying portfolio. NextEra Energy Partners is the seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and the sun in the world, with over 10 gigawatts of renewables in operation. The partnership owns renewable projects that deliver high-quality cash flows in 30 states, serving 94 customers with an average counterparty credit rating of BBB plus via contracts with an average remaining contract life of 14 years. We remain optimistic the partnership can be an attractive vehicle to own existing renewable assets over the long term. We want the partnership to be successful, and separately, to address a question we've been receiving from some investors, NextEra Energy has no plans to buy back NextEra Energy Partners. With that, I'll turn the call over to John."

Our view is that the Public Service Commission is going to take that up soon and will likely be in a position early next year, I would say first quarter of next year, to be able to send that back up to the Supreme Court with the additional details that the Supreme Court is looking forward to receiving. That process would be very similar to the process, both the timeline and the materials that the Public Service Commission went through with the Duke case that was remanded by the Supreme Court back to the Public Service Commission last year, where the Public Service Commission did not reopen the record. We don't expect our record to be reopened and made sure that they put together a conclusion that would be satisfactory in their view with the Supreme Court and send it back to the Supreme Court. So we think we're on the same process as that Duke case was, and we look forward to having the Public Service Commission resubmit that, again, first quarter of next year."

            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Good morning, Steve. So, we are thrilled with the signings that we posted for this quarter. Obviously, Kirk highlighted that 3.2 gigawatts is a record for us. It's specifically the first time we've been over three gigawatts and it represents, all the things that I think you would want to see, which is strong returns across the portfolio, a great mix of technologies, a good mix of customer type that we signed and entered into these agreements, and also a mix of signings in terms of the date and across those technologies. There were -- our first additions to the backlog in 2027, I actually think it is slightly disproportionate to what we're seeing in terms of our overall backlog and a strong pipeline of projects that we see going into the fourth quarter, which are far more weighted to a little bit in '24 and a lot more in '25 and '26, but we're really excited about it. So, really strong and exciting development pipeline and I'll echo John's comments and it's really what we're seeing on the ground, that after some weariness over the last couple of years, our customers are really, drawn to us for our ability to execute. They understand the pipeline that we're building and the resources that we bring to bear to get projects successfully built and I think that increasingly matters and we're going to continue to address it quarterly. But, all signs are very positive for what I'm seeing today. Thanks, Steve.# Hey, Shahriar, it's Rebecca, I'll take that one. So, we're super excited about repowers as part of the longer-term growth plan within NEP. And with such an extensive pipeline of renewable projects, to pursue these repowers, it'll be a nice complement to continuing to acquire assets. So, it doesn't meet the entire growth plan, but certainly is a nice part of it. As we talked about in May, we have a total of 1.3 gigawatts that we see in the near term. And obviously, this is a first step forward in order to make progress on that. So, attractive CAFD yields, as we noted, there's still some steps to finish. But we're also not done with the opportunities repower other assets in the portfolio. Dave, I'll take that. As you know, we've always characterized the backdrop for renewables as a competitive environment. So, I'm very proud of how this team, our team, is executed across an ever-changing environment. And I certainly think it's a strength of our team and most importantly, the competitive advantages that John has highlighted, investment over a long period of time, the ability to work with our supply chain, the ability to work with the folks that we partner with to build the projects and ultimately operate these projects well over time. So, I think that really contributes to our ability to maintain appropriate returns and I also think it reflects what you expect us to do, which is adjust to all of the current costs of both building, financing and operating projects over time and we believe that we are successfully able to achieve that. In terms of demand, obviously, we can't fully predict the future, but I can tell you that the two data points that I think are really top of mind and illustrated from our report today is 3.2 gigawatts is a fantastic sign I think, of demand. And as I highlighted a minute ago to Steve's question, a good underlying foundation of technology, dates, locations, etcetera. So, I'm really pleased and also, in looking at the pipeline for the fourth quarter, obviously, this is a development business. Things can change. But I believe that we're in a good position to continue realizing strong demand, particularly in that 24 timeframe to 26 timeframe. So, based on what we see today, very exciting and I think it's founded on the things that you all know well, which is a backdrop of increasing electrification, increasing demand for generation and capacity value across our sector, and renewables continuing to be the least cost form of generation. So, I would hope you would expect what I would argue is the best position company to execute well against an environment like that. And I'd love to add one point on that because I think it's a great complement to our broader business and particularly the C&I customers that we're working with to actually buy some of the renewable energy. Some of the customers that are most active in the market in procuring renewable energy are also the ones that are most interested in buying tax credits from us and I think they really like the value proposition, certainly of the economics, as John highlighted, but really like the value proposition supporting and enabling investment in renewable projects. So we see a really deep market, a lot of interest, and really a lot of cross-selling opportunities across the portfolio. Thanks, Carly. It's a great question. Yes, I definitely support that first part of your comment. And it's consistent with what I had said before that I think this quarter was a little bit anomalous in terms of the waiting to 2027 and the pipeline is very much more weighted for what I see today for '24, '25, and '26, with much of it in the '25 and '26 timeframe, just given the fact that we're ending into '24. In terms of the technology, obviously, we had very strong findings for storage and as Kirk highlighted in the prepared remarks, in terms of the -- maybe not surprise is probably not the right word, but really pleased to see how we're starting to see adoption across a broader set of markets, not just California, but into the Midwest, where our utility customers and obviously some of the C&I are really valuing the ability to incorporate storage for capacity value and affirming and shaping the renewables product. So that's really positive in my mind. On the wind side, I think we're still seeing a little bit of dynamics that shaped up as a result of the tax credits that we originally we and the industry \u2013 thought were going to phase down after 2020. So we saw a significant amount of pull forward of demand. And I think that's still affecting the industry a little bit and then, obviously, the PTC being extended for solar significantly improved the economics from a relative standpoint, which has been super positive for demand. We still see a lot of geographies where wind is incredibly attractive and so I feel good about long-term demand for wind and I also feel really good about long-term demand for repowering projects. Obviously, we had a great start to the repowering initiative following the IRA extension with over 700 megawatts we talked about today. Obviously, its share for a year, it's a little bit less than that, but when you look across the entire tens of gigawatts now of renewable projects, there's lots of opportunities to repower as well. So overall, across the board, really excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thanks, Kirk. Let me briefly address NextEra Energy Partners. It's been a difficult year, and we have a lot of work to do. As Kirk shared, we are focused on executing against our transition plans and look forward to providing an update on the Texas Pipeline portfolio sales process on or before the fourth quarter earnings call. We are also focused on delivering LP distribution growth of 6% through at least 2026, and the repowerings we announced today are a good start towards achieving that objective. At NextEra Energy, our foundations are rooted in FPL, the nation's largest electric utility, and NextEra Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables. Both businesses have performed very well, complement each other, and push one another to be even better. This is validated by the solid financial and operating results both continue to deliver and the excellent progress we are making against our development expectations. Over recent weeks, we met with many of our investors and have welcomed your feedback. In response, we addressed many of the questions we heard from you in our remarks today and in the presentation materials you now have. Along those lines, I want to reiterate the solid fundamentals on which NextEra Energy is built and our outstanding prospects for future growth, having just completed our annual strategy review process with our board of directors. FPL remains among the best utilities in the United States, achieving top operational performance across key metrics while maintaining the industry's lowest cost structure, one of the cleanest emissions profiles, and a customer bill that is roughly 30% lower than the national average. It is located in one of the fastest growing states with what we believe is one of the country's most constructive regulatory environments. FPL has by far the lowest non-fuel O&M of any large utility in the nation. Over the last 20 years, our relentless focus on cost, efficiency and low bills have saved customers nearly $15 billion in fuel cost alone. Year after year, FPL receives top accolades for reliability, despite operating on a peninsula and historically facing a high probability for hurricanes. It has plans to add approximately 20 gigawatts of solar over the next 10 years for the benefit of its customers while undergrounding its distribution system to lower operating costs and withstand the impacts of hurricanes to help keep the Florida economy, which is now the 16th largest in the world, running on all cylinders. We believe FPL is the highest quality regulated utility in the country. At Energy Resources, we are just getting started. Renewable penetration as part of the US generating mix currently stands at roughly 16% and is expected to double, reaching over 30% by 2030. As the world's leader in renewable energy with an approximately 20% market share in US renewables origination, Energy Resources stands to benefit significantly from the unstoppable shift towards electrification. Experience and scale matter, and with over 20 years of renewables experience, a 31 gigawatt operating portfolio, a development pipeline of roughly 300 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects, and roughly 150 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions we are well positioned for future growth. In addition to our scale and competitive advantages that you all know well, our ability to finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector provides us with an access to and cost of capital advantage. We believe all of this enables us to differentiate ourselves in a complex macro environment to build even more renewables at attractive returns. In short, we believe Energy Resources has built the most competitive and complete renewable energy business in the world and is in a better position than ever to lead the decarbonization of the US economy. We have spent the last two decades building a world-class clean energy platform powered by our greatest strength, our people, and a culture of continuous improvement that drives innovation and smart clean energy solutions. I want to extend my appreciation to our team today as we remain committed to serving our customers and providing long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you, and now we welcome your questions. Yeah, Steve, on that slide, I'll take that. This is John. We are -- the example is a $1 dollars. You take a $1 dollars, you divide by the 18% FFO to debt, that gets you about $5.5 billion. You add the $1 billion of cash that you receive, and that gets you the $6.5 billion of equity content on a $1 billion transfer. The way I think about it is it's going to show up in your cash flow from operations. That's the cash that you actually receive, and then there's also some equity content that benefits the rest of the sources, including corporate debt issuances. Yeah, the way I think about it, Steve, it's 70%. So, when you think about our backlog, just some rough math, if you take the $20.5 billion, I would think about roughly $15.5 billion of that or so going against the backlog, and then the balance going against near-term maturities that we have through 2026. But the interest rate sensitivity that we have given you includes our exposure on everything, right? So, on the project debt, on the corporate debt issuances, it includes it all. Yeah, Steve, I'm going to turn it over to Rebecca. But one thing I would say is the renewable business is increasingly moving more and more towards the scale players, and you can see reasons why. One of them is the ability to have a balance sheet to actually enter into the kind of interest rate hedges that we can enter into. If you can't do that, that really puts you at a significant disadvantage. And then all the other competitive advantages that you're all aware of, where, we buy at scale, we build at scale, we operate at scale. And the last point I want to make is the cost of capital advantage. In today's market environment, having a strong balance sheet with an ultimate parent with an A-minus rating is really, really important, and a super big competitive advantage that we have over the smaller developers that we compete against and that's a big part of our success. But let me turn it over to Rebecca to talk more about what she's seeing in the market. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Let me start by saying, obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, our focus is on selling these pipes, growing at 6% and putting NEP in a position to succeed going forward. So, along those lines, we continue to work very diligently on the sales process. We're working with counterparties to get it done. And at the same time, look, this is a little bit more of a challenging macroeconomic environment. These are very valuable pipes and we are looking for a transaction that maximizes value for unit holders and we're going to continue to be disciplined. But in terms of the progress that we're making, things are continuing to advance and move forward and we look forward to having a further update either on the fourth quarter call or sometime before that in terms of where we are. Yeah. Listen, thank you. Thank you, Shahriar and obviously, we are very, very focused, as always on costs. We're very, very focused on capital productivity and efficiency as well. So, those are two levers we always have and I think our shareholder base is very familiar with the success that we've had in our annual cost reduction processes that we run across the company. But those are certainly point of focus for us and look, when I think about the $3 billion of equity and the $3 billion of asset recycling, if you look historically at what we've been able to do, I'd be pretty disappointed if we can only do $3 billion of asset recycling, not only through NEP, but third parties and as a reminder, over the last three or four years, we've been very successful in selling renewable projects, not only to NEP, but to third parties. Think about the OTPP transaction, the Apollo transaction, the KKR transaction. So, we feel very good about our sources plan that we've laid out and look forward to executing against it. Yeah, Dave, I'll take that question. First of all, I would argue, we have an outstanding tax department. And our tax department, yeah, together with our treasury group started early and we've already reached out to 50 of the top U.S. taxpayers in our building relationships and have had terrific execution against our '23 plan. The demand is extremely robust for tax credit transfers and we're already working on '24 as we speak, having '23 pretty much behind us. And one of the things that really helps NextEra and the tax transfer market is the fact that we have a strong balance sheet. We have an A minus rate from the parent and we're able to underwrite the credit. And being able to underwrite the credit is really, really important because we compete against a lot of really small developers that can't, that if you go to the top 50 taxpayers, they've never heard of these companies. They don't know who they are. They don't really know what they do. They know NextEra and we can provide an indemnity behind the tax credit that we transfer. It sleeves off our vest, so to speak, to be able to do that and we get preferred pricing because of it and so I feel great about where things stand in terms of our tax credit transfer program. Yeah, I'll go ahead and take that, Julien. First of all, when you look at our tax equity project finance split, things can move around. Let's just hypothetically think about it as kind of 50-50. I think that might be a decent starting place to think about and we feel very good about our ability to be able to access tax equity. the regulatory issues, I think, that you pointed out, I think, are going to get resolved. I think there were some unintended consequences around Basel III, and we have had significant discussions with the folks involved. On those issues, the administration certainly thinks this was an unintended consequence, as do, I think, folks at the Fed and the administration, I think, is very focused on trying to get a good resolution around it. But, I don't worry about it too much at the end of the day for us. I think the Basel III thing gets fixed and, worst-case scenario, the banks will find other pockets to be able to issue tax equity. We'll be issue -- we'll receive our allocation off the top of the deck like we always do. And, these relationships that I just spoke about with corporate parties, these 50 folks or so that we've been dealing with, there's no reason they can't step in and provide tax equity financing. And we'll be talking to them about those structures as well and then transferability, which we've already spent some time talking about this morning, can fill any gap. So long story short, we feel terrific about our ability to source tax equity financing going forward. Can you say that again, Julien? Yeah. The tax transferability is not in that number. Again, it shows up in cash flow from operations and then the equity content that's created really shows up in that corporate debt issuance line, but look at the corporate-the cash flow from operations in terms of the dollars that we're receiving for tax credit transfers. Yeah. So a couple of points I'll make. One is you've seen the sensitivity. So zero impact in '23 or '24, $0.03 to $0.05 in '25 and '26. With the five year to 10 year tenors, with the average coupon 375 basis points, we feel very good about the protection that we have there. We've talked about where FPL sits. And then you think about the project financings that we entered into. We use those hedges. Those project financings are basically 20 year amortizing debt that have 20 year hedges that then get rolled into them that have the benefit of those swaps and so when you think about our existing project finance portfolio that we have, there's another $4 billion of interest rate swaps that aren't even in the $20.5 billion that we mentioned to you today that protect and safeguard those as they roll and do. So long story short, between the $20.5 billion that we have against the backlog the fact that our existing portfolio is already locked in and hedged, we feel very good about our interest rate exposure. Yeah. So when I think about it, Carly, renewables come top of mind. We've had a history over the last several years of being able to recycle capital through renewables. But remember, too, we're a large company. There are other assets that could potentially be available for capital recycling that are non-core. The FCG transaction that we just recently announced is a good example of that and we'll always look for opportunities. If there are situations where third parties value assets more than we do, then sure, we'll look to be opportunistic, but it's not a core part of the plan. Sure. Yeah, let me take that, Andrew. So, first of all, with supply chain, things are really improved a lot. As Rebecca just mentioned, we have the two issues, right? CERC convention, which has been asked and answered, provided a lot of clarity around what can be done, what can't, and with the Presidential Proclamation. So, in very good shape there. Second was forced labor and making sure that our suppliers are working constructively with Customs and Border Patrol to get their panels cleared for importation into the country. And so, for the most part all of our solar suppliers have been able to do that and so, we are in very good shape there. I think on grid power, I actually the grid-level issues that you just mentioned, we're in very good shape on. We had gone long on grid-level equipment, including transformers and so, we have a significant supply in our inventory and we've also looked forward in a plan for this in terms of trying to make sure that we have equipment available where if our customers or the transmission owner in the places that we're building renewables are short on equipment, are short on grid-level equipment in particular, that we have it in our inventory and are able to offer that up as a solution. And I think one of the big benefits that we have, given our scale and given our leverage and the ability to buy this equipment in very large quantities and really lock up a lot of the manufacturing lines for this equipment, it's a true competitive advantage for a renewable business the way I think about it. Both are. Both are because both need it."

Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 8.6% as we deploy capital for the benefit of FPL customers and leverage our competitive advantages to extend Energy Resources for a noble leadership position.  As our fastest growing state in the U.S., Florida has underlying population growth and an economy that continues to drive clear investment needs. For years, FPL strategy has been simple: Keep bills affordable, the grid reliable, and our customer service exceptional.  With our most recent settlement agreement, FPL has a well-established capital plan with clear visibility through 2025 to deliver on this strategy. This quarter we executed our capital plan with new solar and transmission and distribution infrastructure investments, which led to a greater than 12% increase in regulatory capital employed versus the same quarter last year.  As a result, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.07 year-over-year. We progress these capital initiatives, while keeping customer bills affordable. We continue to run the business efficiently with multiple opportunities to reduce and manage costs. We deploy smart capital that reduces O&M and fuel costs. We embrace innovation and new technologies and we identify cost savings through our various initiatives.  Customers benefit from these actions, including bills that are among the lowest in Florida and well below the national average. FPL is uniquely positioned to extend its best-class customer value proposition and deliver long-term growth.  Energy Resources, more than two decade track record of originating, developing, constructing, and operating renewables remains as strong as ever. This quarter, on the strength of new investments, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings by over 14% year-over-year. We continue to see solid renewables and storage demand.  Since our first quarter call, Energy Resources placed over 1,800 megawatts into commercial operations. And it's added approximately 1,665 megawatts of new renewable and storage projects to our backlog, which now stands at roughly 20 gigalons, keeping us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.  Given all of our competitive advantages, Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the decolonization of the U.S. economy and be the renewables partner of choice, supporting power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.  We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2023. For over 18 months we have operated in a challenging macroeconomic environment with various headwinds. And yet, we have leveraged our competitive advantages to serve customers and deliver on our financial expectations.  Through the first half of the year, both businesses have executed well, delivering adjusted EPS growth of approximately 11%. With FPL comprising more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business, our well-established capital plan through 2025 provides investors with long-term growth visibility.  At Energy Resources, we are leveraging our competitive advantages to continue adding new renewables and storage to our backlog, providing clear visibility to our future earnings growth through 2026. Combined, we believe we are well positioned with strong visibility to deliver on our expectations and create long-term value for shareholders.  With that, let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL.  For the second quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of approximately $1.152 billion or $0.57 per share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.1% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current settlement agreements four year term, which runs through 2025.  FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter and we now expect FPL's full year 2023 capital investment to be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion.  For the 12 months ending June 2023, FPLs reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the quarter, we used approximately $78 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1 billion.  Our capital projects continue to progress well. As we indicated in our recent 10-year site plan, solar continues to be the lowest cost alternative for our customers. FPL placed into service roughly 225 megawatts of cost effective solar in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date solar additions to nearly 1,200 megawatts. Over the last two years, FPL has commissioned over 1,600 megawatts of new solar generation. With two and a half years remaining under the current settlement agreement, FPL expects to add roughly 3,100 megawatts of incremental solar through 2025. FPL solar investments allow us to serve strong customer growth, while providing clean, affordable generation and avoiding volatile fuel purchases.  Over the current four year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL with a capital investment of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Of that total, we anticipate investing approximately $10 billion in new solar generation and approximately $14 billion to $16 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure. We remain confident in our total capital plan through 2025, as our cumulative capital investments of approximately $14 billion through June of 2023 are a little ahead of our original timeline.  Our capital investment plan is well-established and by executing on solar deployment and transmission and distribution investments, we are enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry.  I'll turn now to the Florida Economy, which continues to demonstrate strong growth. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 412,000 new private sector jobs, and its unemployment rate continues to decline, currently standing at approximately 2.6%, which is nearly 30% below the U.S. average. Florida consumer sentiment improved roughly 14% compared to the prior year and remains above the U.S. average, while mortgage delinquency rates decline by 55 basis points compared to the prior year. Florida's GDP continues to trend upward, an increase over 9% versus a year ago.  During the quarter, FPL had solid customer growth with the average number of customers increasing by more than 66,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased by approximately 0.3% year-over-year. We estimate that weather had a slightly negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 0.3% on a year-over-year basis.  After taking these factors into account, second quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued solid underlying population growth.  Now let's turn to Energy Resources, where second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings, we're approximately $1.462 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter we're approximately $781 million dollars or $0.39 per share, which is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 year-over-year.  Contributions from new investments increased $0.10 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.06 per share. This decline was mostly due to a large swing in year-over-year wind resource.  This quarter was the lowest second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.09 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses, compared to a relatively weak contribution in the prior year quarter.  All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. This decline reflects higher interest cost of $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments and half of which is due to higher interest rates. The remaining impact is due to a combination of other factors, including additional costs to support early stage renewable development investments as we plan for growth in the latter part of the decade.  Energy Resources had a solid quarter of new renewables and storage origination adding approximately 1,665 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now tolls roughly 20 gigawatts, after taking into account over 1,800 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our first quarter call, which keeps us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.  Having shared our new expectations just six months ago, we are already within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range and only need roughly 15 gigawatts over the next three and 1.5 years to achieve the midpoint of the 2023 to 2026 development expectations range.  As part of our backlog addition, this quarter we signed our first contract for a standalone battery storage project co-located with an existing wind facility. The 65 megawatts storage project is expected to serve our customers growing capacity needs in the southwest power pool and be available to monetize pricing arbitrage opportunities in this renewable rich area of the country.  As we have highlighted, we believe there are many more opportunities to monetize the value of our existing 29 gigawatts operating renewables portfolio, including deploying co-located storage like we did here. We are excited to bring facility into commercial operation.  During the quarter we continue to see solid demand for renewables and storage across power and commercial and industrial customers. After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations. We believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation, and position ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects.  Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early stage diligence in our current backlog, and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well positioned for growth and our renewable business for years to come.  We also remain excited about the opportunity to serve hydrogen customers by leveraging our best-in-class renewables development expertise and early stage development position. Throughout the quarter we continue to advocate for smart hydrogen policy that we believe would help the U.S. establish a robust green hydrogen market and drive increased renewables penetration.  We also progress our pipeline of potential green hydrogen opportunities by executing an additional memorandum of understanding to explore developing green hydrogen and related facilities that would integrate into our customers' operations and serve their energy needs.  Hydrogen should be thought of as simply another renewables customer class, and as all our hydrogen related projects could potentially translate into additional new renewables, and with the appropriate regulations, begin to contribute to Energy Resources growth later this decade.  Turning now to our consolidated results. For the second quarter of 2023, GAAP earnings attributed to NextEra Energy were approximately $2.795 billion or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy recorded approximately $1.777 billion of adjusted earnings and $0.88 cents of adjusted EPS in the second quarter.  Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased results by $0.04 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We continue to proactively manage interest rates in multiple ways. First, NextEra Energy has $16 billion of various interest rate swaps to help mitigate the impact of future increases in rate.  Second, FPL has features in its settlement agreement to offset higher interest rates such as reserve amortization and the ROE adjustment mechanism, which became effective on September 1, 2022 due to a sustained rise in the 30 year U.S. Treasury yield.  Finally, our focus on continuous improvement through our annual velocity productivity initiative has yielded over $725 million in annual run rate savings ideas. Over the last two years, creating cost savings opportunities to help offset higher interest costs. As always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations.  Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges. In each year, from 2023 to 2026, while the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.  From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year, through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Now, I'd like to turn to NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $486 million and $200 million respectively, reflecting weaker wind resource. NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to deliver on its 2023 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.  Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.854 per share per common unit or $3.42 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 12% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit over 355% since the IPO.  Since our last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of approximately 690 megawatts of wind and solar assets. With this acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners renewable portfolio is over 10,000 megawatts. Further strengthening its position as the world's seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and sun. The partnership is well-positioned to execute on its simplification plan to become a 100% renewables focus company.  Regarding this simplification plan, in May we launched the sales process for the Texas Natural Gas Pipeline portfolio and are pleased with our progress is we remain on track to sell the assets by later this year. NextEra Energy Partners expects to use the proceeds from the planned Texas Pipeline portfolio sales together with a mean natural gas pipeline sale in 2025 to eliminate the equity buyouts on the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financing. STX Midstream and EP Renewables 2, and 2019 NEP Pipelines. Upon successful execution of the Texas pipeline portfolio sell, the partnership does not expect to require equity through 2024, other than opportunistic equity issuances under our at the market equity program to fund future growth beyond 2024.  Now to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $486 million and $200 million respectively, reflecting the adverse impacts of weaker wind resource. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $99 million and $39 million respectively, primarily driven by a large swing in year-over-year wind resource. This quarter was the lowest-second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest.  New projects contributed approximately $49 million of adjusted EBITDA and $5 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were positively impacted by the Incentive Distribution Rights Fee Suspension and provided approximately $38 million of benefit this quarter, partially offsetting the impact of poor wind resource performance.  As we previously shared, we expect strong double-digit growth in the second half of the year and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, LP distribution per unit growth expectations range for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year and LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. However, as we previously shared with you, we expect to grow at or near the bottom end of that range. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit.  NextEra Energy Partners continue to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution and its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023 to be in the ranges of $2.2 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As always, our expectations subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.  In summary, we believe that NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders and unit holders. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple: Our two businesses are deploying capital and renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we're executing on our well-established capital investment plan, which allows us to extend our customer value proposition.  Florida\u2019s strong population growth drives smart capital investment and running the business efficiently allows us to manage costs for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. FPL comprises more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business and provides a significant amount of visibility into capital deployment and earnings growth.  At Energy Resources, we're leveraging our more than 20 years of experience, competitive advantages to grow our market share and add to our now roughly 20 gigawatts backlog, providing terrific growth visibility through 2026. We believe these competitive advantages will enable Energy Resources to serve power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.  With an opportunity set of $20 billion of capital investment, requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables, Energy Resources is well-positioned to be green hydrogen partner of choice, potentially creating new opportunities toward the end of the decade.  At NextEra Energy Partners we are executing on our plans to sell our natural gas pipelines and simplify the business. We continue to add to our renewables and storage portfolio, which now stands at over 10,000 megawatts. With the sale of the Texas Natural Gas Pipeline portfolio expected to be completed by the end of the year, NextEra Energy Partners remains on track to transition to a 100% pure play renewables company, while continuing to deliver LP distribution per unit growth for unit holders.  With that, we're happy to answer your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Res. You may now go ahead. \nSteve Fleishman : Yeah, hey good morning, thanks. Hope you're all well. So a couple \u2013 first, just on the quarter. The customer supply trading business continues to do well and you mentioned higher margins. I think Constellation has been talking about that too. Could you just talk more about what you think is driving that in the supply business? \nJohn Ketchum : Yeah, sure Steve. This is John Ketchum and a good morning to you as well. In the customer supply and trading business, we\u2019re just seeing a lot less competition, number one. And number two, remember, a lot of \u2013 most of the business activity that we do in that group is customer facing business. Our full requirements business for example, where we're working with municipalities and cooperatives to help provide their power needs and arrange the capacity and ancillaries and other regulatory requirements that need to manage their business, particularly up in the North East.  That business, because it's had a lot less competition, it has benefited from significant margins. And please, you know one of the points I want to make is, these arrangements that we enter into in the full requirements business are typically two or three years and we're immediately going at them back to back, hedging those positions. So feel great about the risk profile, and again, terrific margins that really match up well with their skill sets, our competitive advantages and our core operations. So that's really the main driver.  And I also want to remind folks that when you think about our customer and supply business we run it at a very, very low bar. For example, the last quarter we ran that business roughly at a 2% bar. So it's very, very small business, risk exposure overall for PMI. \nSteve Fleishman : Okay, next question just on\u2026 [Cross Talk]\nJohn Ketchum : Steve, one other point I want to make too on the customer supply business is that that business, historically you can go back 10 years and the customer supply and trading business, including this year has never contributed more than 10% of NextEra Energies net income and I think that's important to keep in mind as well. We run a \u2013 we have a lot of complementary businesses. Obviously, FPL has done well. We have other complementary businesses that Energy Resources on top of our renewable business. But that business has always stayed under 10% and that's one of the commitments that we make to the rating agencies, and that's true this year as well. \nSteve Fleishman : Okay, great. Just maybe just the latest year hearing on the hydrogen, green hydrogen rules from Treasury, both kind of timing in any color of where they are on some of the key issues like matching and additionality. Thanks. \nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, we have been very vocal around the hydrogen regulations that need to come together and there's been a debate for those that are familiar with it, between whether we have hourly matching or annual matching. And for us it's very simple, as part of a hydrogen project you buy an expensive asset called an electrolyzer, which everyone is familiar with. And if you have hourly matching, the net capacity factor, the number of hours a day that you use that electrolyzer are probably less than half the day in most parts of the country.  If you have an annual construct, we're able to use that electrolyzer around the clock and so it's really easy math. I mean, when you have an expensive capital asset and you can use it around the clock, the price of green hydrogen is going to be a lot lower if you can only use it less than half a time.  And so the industry has come forward with a very constructive proposal, which would have the hourly matching construct not kick in until 2028. You\u2019d have annual until that time period and we also have supported the fact that you have to have additionality if you're going to go qualify for annuals.  So if you're qualifying for annual in the hours that the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining the power, the electrolyzer behind the meter and you are buying off the grid. Well, you're buying from an additional renewable asset that has been constructed and developed to provide electrons to that newly built hydrogen facility. So from an NGO perspective, you're getting additional decarbonization benefits on the grid.  So we think we've been very constructive in what we have come forward with. We think it's really important, because we want to send the right price signal to OEMs to ramp up production on electrolyzers, because electrolyzers being produced at scale is going to be critically important to declines in green hydrogen prices over time. And so that's where we are in terms of your question around timing. We expect Treasury to probably come out with regulations now. We're hoping for August, but it's starting to sound more like September or October.  But again, we have built a significant hydrogen pipeline, parts of it work on either construct and that pipeline is well over $20 billion and we have the land team out and we've had them out, very aggressively lining up land positions for our hydrogen portfolio that the nice thing about that and which Kirk said it in the remarks, that pipeline is now about 250 gigawatts when you include early due diligence sites.  Nobody in our industry has a pipeline like that, nobody, and what's terrific about it is it can be used for dual purpose, because hydrogen customers are just a third customer class to sell renewables to. So if the site doesn't work for hydrogen, it will work for our power or C&I customers.  So I feel like we're really well positioned and hydrogen is one of those things that can really provide a nice boom to the development expectations that we've already laid out for you. So we're eager to see what the final regulations say. But I also want to remind folks that hydrogen has a long development cycle, so the contribution that we'll see from hydrogen investments you would expect over the latter part of the decade.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay, last question, just on the Texas sale. So I think you said you'd still expect to get it done by year end. When would that, when would you need or expect to or need to kind of announce transaction to make the year-end and just how should we think about the recent data points we've seen like the TransCanada, the TC sell down, Columbia sell down, and co-point. I know they're different assets, but just in the context of views on valuation of energy. Thank you. \nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, thank you Steve. So let me take those in order. So in terms of timing, we would hope to be in a position, in the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter in order to support that end of the year sales timeline that we have earmarked.  In terms of valuation, we view these assets as unique. Again as a reminder, the Texas pipelines provide 25% of the natural gas supply to Mexico through contracts with Pemex, and the other pipeline assets that support the Texas pipeline are fully integrated with that pipe, and they provide gas to Mexico, through (inaudible), which is a very liquid trading point. And if you look around that area, these are very, very strategic for a number of players.  So again, as you all know, it's hard to compare one pipe comp to another, but again, we remain pleased with the progress that we continue to make on the sales transaction. \nSteve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you. \nJohn Ketchum: Thank you, Steve. \nJohn Ketchum: Oh! And Steve. I think I said 2% on the bar, I meant $2 million on the bar for PMI, just correct that. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. You may not go ahead. \nShahriar Pourreza : Hey! Good morning, guys. \nJohn Ketchum: Good morning, Shah. \nShahriar Pourreza : Good morning. Let me just, as we kind of look at the latest renewable portfolio transactions, the valuations have come in fairly noticeably. Do you guys see any opportunities to kind of leverage NextEra platform in either picking up existing assets or developer books, especially sort of given what seems to still be a type financing and supply chain position for some of your competitors, while you're seeing improvements with yours, right? \nKirk Crews: Yeah, we are. I mean, first of all let me just comment on the valuations that you see. I mean, I think that \u2013 look, I'm not going to be critical on some of the assets that have come to sale. But, if you read through the lines and into the details of the structures of those transactions, those are not characterized as high quality renewable assets.  When you look back at what we have developed over the last 20 years and what we continue to develop are very high quality renewable assets. Most of them are bus bar. They are with high credit counterparty off-takers. They are well situated in areas that benefit from our data analytics around transmission congestion, wind resource, solar resource. Because we have 20 years of experience, I like to believe and look, we are perfect, but we don't make some of the same mistakes that you see some of the other developers make.  And so I feel like we're much better positioned. Our portfolio is in much better position than some of the other markers that you have seen. So I'd be very, very careful on how you assess portfolio to portfolio, because they are very, very different.  The second thing I would say is, we look at all third-party M&A opportunities that come available and we feel like we do have all the competitive advantages, you know some of what you mentioned. We buy cheap, we build cheap, we operate cheap, we have a cost-capable advantage. We have a terrific team that really understands how to optimize the value of existing assets, that's the key piece.  Repowering assets is something we've always had a very strong track record at. It\u2019s something that the rest of the industry has struggled with and that gives us a real leg up in terms of being able to see values that others don't. And then as Kirk mentioned on the call today, we have a benefit and an organic asset that nobody else has, which is the largest fleet in North America that we operate.  And so we have the ability not only to repower those existing assets, but to find ways to pair them up with storage and take advantage of the stand-alone storage ITC. As you all know, storage used to only be a unique opportunity to pair with solar. The rules of change with the stand-alone storage ITC under IRA. So now we can pair it with wind, we can build a stand-alone. We're making a lot of progress in that area.  We announced one project today where we are starting to see an opportunity, particularly in MISO and SPP, in ERCOT, where capacity values and reliability are being priced higher than what we've seen them in the past, given some of the shortfalls that they have in those markets and that just happens to coincide with where most of our wind is.  And given the massive existing fleet that we have, which very importantly includes an existing interconnection agreement, our ability to go and pair those assets up with solar or to repower them is unique in this industry given the two-decade head start that we have. And so that's a value that we try to bring to M&A opportunities as well when we exercise our other competitive advantages, including our cost-to-capable advantage. \nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And John, it's been a little bit quiet and it hasn't really been a focus for a lot of investors, but is there any sort of updates around the FTC case as of today? Any change in stances indicated by the disclosures? Any opportunities to settle? Thanks. \nJohn Ketchum : Yeah, thank you Shah for the question. No new developments and there's really no new news there. Again, we would expect just based on historical precedent with the FTC that we would hear back where they have a reasonable belief that they should investigate, probably sometime in the first quarter of 2024. \nShahriar Pourreza : Perfect. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Fantastic. \nJohn Ketchum: Thank you, Shah. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may now go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey! Good morning John. Good morning Kirk. Thank you guys very much. So I wanted to come back to the decade into the cadence to the backlog conditions. Just looking at, \u201823, \u201824 versus \u201825, \u201826 there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there in terms of the ability to execute in kind of the nearer term sense to execute against that first bucket versus the latter here?  And especially, give us a little bit of an update on IRS clarity and what that means for the willingness to commit to the close-on contracts here, especially maybe now that you have that in hand on transferability, etcetera. How do you think about maybe biasing towards the later years there, just given where we stand already? \nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, good question, Julien. So let me just start with \u2013 take that in chunks, because everyone knows our development expectations are \u201823 to \u201826. So let's just start with the first two years and then we'll talk about the second two years.  So for \u201823 through \u201824, we are in great shape. We are already within the range as we had expected to be. And then on \u201825 and \u201826, you know if you go back to the beginning of \u201822, and you add up where we are today, we've already added 12 gigawatts just in the last six quarters. That puts us in great shape against \u201825 and \u201826, because now we have 15 gigawatts to get to the midpoint and if you kind of work backwards from \u201826, that's 3.5 years to get 15 gigawatts.  So we feel like we are really in great position and on track on that build. And I think there's some real tailwinds that we're going to start to see come forward and I want to explain some dynamics, you know just around what we've seen in the renewable industry, which was part of your question Julien.  Let's just go back to \u201822. I mean, in \u201822 we saw a lot of supply chain issues that started to surface. And then we saw here a flip, we saw circumvention and that cost them delays. It also cost us outages supply, because some developers are scrambling for panels that they thought they could get into the country, which I think for a short period of time drove prices up.  The great thing is, all those 22 projects that got delayed in to \u201823 are now starting to go into commercial operation. That's a really good news, good news for customers, because those customers that were digesting that \u201822 build and waiting for those projects to go COD in to \u201823 are now coming back to the market. And so we're seeing really strong demand from those folks as we start to look forward.  The other benefit of that is as you see you flip up, as you start to get works work through. We're not seeing that you flip awhole back that we used to see, so we're making a lot of progress on that front. When you take that into account with the clarity that we're now seeing around circumvention, we finally have this bright line rule with the six-part test and as long as you meet four of the six, and you're importing from Southeast Asia, you're okay. And so what we've seen is a relaxation in pricing as a result of that. So now the risk premium that was being charged last year by the import market is starting to come down.  The other terrific phenomenon that we're seeing around solar pricing is that Southeast Asia still sets the price for panels in the U.S., but as that risk price premium is starting to come down and Southeast Asia really wants a big part of the U.S. market. Why do they want a big part of the U.S. market? They sell panels for $0.20 everywhere else, right? They've been selling panels for $0.40 roughly in the U.S. So they have a lot of room to move.  And so as that risk premium comes down around, you flip in and circumvention is forcing prices down in the U.S. At the same time you're seeing a lot more U.S. supply come online through new module facilities are getting announced, also through cell facilities that will come along with it. And so the bottom line is when you look at the solar picture, it's favorable from an equipped price standpoint, because I think you're starting to see a lot of capacity come online that is going to force prices down over time, particularly as you see the U.S. market evolve.  And it's no secret with some of the economic data coming out of China that some of those Southeast Asian markets are under pressure with capacity, excess capacity positions, and so they've got batteries and panels they need to find things to do with. Battery prices are coming down as well. We\u2019re finally seeing a relaxation in battery prices. Really struggling to see \u2013 really struggling in the EV market in China, which has created very much in excess capacity around batteries and so we\u2019re finally starting to see some relaxation there. I think there's been more of a movement around traditional lithium ion and some of the rare mineral exposure you see there, sodium and other battery forms, and so very encouraged about the landscape there.  And then on the wind OEM side, the wind folks are really one of the only ones that can reap the full benefit of domestic content and the full manufacturer incentive. So we feel really good about where wind sits as well.  So I think as you start to look forward and we started to move through these supply chain issues you saw in \u201822 of these projects coming online in \u201823 come combined with excess capacity globally around the supply chain, we feel great there. And let me talk about transferability for a second. There's been a lot of discussion and I've heard a lot of questions about folks saying, well, how is transferability going to be accounted for? And is it going to be part of the FFO and in the FFO-to-debt metric.  We feel very good and we've told investors for a long time that we feel very good that it's in accordance with GAAP, it flows through the tax line for tax credits that get transferred, to be included and so we feel good about where that is heading and that will end up in a good place there on that FFO-to-debt question that has surfaced around transferability.  So when you put all those pieces together, as we've worked through some of these headwinds that we've had, we feel very good about where things are heading and let's just face it, we're just getting started. Renewables are here to stay, they're not going anywhere. And so while we might \u2013 you know the development process isn\u2019t always going to be a straight line, we're in terrific shape and feel very optimistic about the future.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. Thank you and actually John, to that point though, a lot of the dynamics you just talked about are very like real time if you will versus kind of trailing into the quarter itself. How do you feel about just that contracting acceleration here in the back half? I mean a lot of the points you made would really argue that you could see an uptick versus kind of something that was more on trend in the last quarter.\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, a lot of it is going to depend on, as I said before, these \u201822 projects continuing to come online in 2023 and those customers that had a little bit of fatigue so to speak. We are around those delays coming back to market which we're starting to see and so that will be the wild card. But we feel good about how the rest of the year continues to shape up.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Will stay tuned on that front. All right, excellent. Thank you sir. \nJohn Ketchum: And Julien, one of the things to add to that is, it\u2019s hydrogen. We get the right rules there and again I can't stress it enough. I mean we've always only had two customer classes for renewable. It's been power sector, it's been the C&I sector. Now with the right rules, we have the potential to add a third customer class, which is the renewables for hydrogen customers and that's exciting as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Yes, so stayed tuned. Maybe a quarter or two after you get those rules that you\u2019ll really see that flow through in that third customer class. \nJohn Ketchum: Yes, I think that's right. And then remember, those projects that have longer lead time development cycles. So in terms of the contribution that investors should expect, it's going to come in the latter part of the decade.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent! Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey! Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe shifting a little bit to NEP. I was wondering, you know I know you don't \u2013 in terms of the financing outlook, you don't need equity for some time here. But I was wondering if you could just give any latest thoughts on alternative financing approaches to hit longer term growth projections at NEP. \nJohn Ketchum: Yes, I mean for NEP, first of all the focus is on the simplification strategy which we shared with the market back in May and we have said that our expectation as a result of that is, we don't \u2013 you know assuming a successful execution on that sale, that we don't expect to have equity requirements in 2024, other than opportunistic equity issuances under our ATM to help finance growth beyond 2024.  But if you look, and you can see in the slides here, that we have a lot of flexibility under our current metrics with the agencies, in terms of the ability to add additional, what I would call traditional debt based capital market financing, mechanisms to accommodate the growth going forward.  And we are very busy looking at the back end, three sublets that we have and some ideas around how we are going to address those as well. Because when we move on from the simplification transaction, that's going to be the next point of focus. We are not \u2013 but we're not waiting. We are continuing to look at that.  And look, there continues to be a strong bid for an interest in renewable interest, in renewable assets long term. Particularly when you think about the opportunity to do that with the world leader in renewable development, with the competitive advantages that we have, the 20 gigawatt backline log. The growth visibility that NEP has going forward, all very promising. And so we could continue to engage in those discussions as well as we think about the future.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it, got it, thanks for that color. And then also just had a question related to the transmission constraints that we've seen in the industry. But you made the comment about a very large interconnection position, 145 gigawatts. I was just wondering if you could speak to the transmission queue challenges and do you think that could potentially be a constraint on growth for the industry or at any point or how much visibility do you have into hitting long term growth targets with that massive queue that you've gotten in place.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, so let me take that in two pieces. I mean one is the 145 gigawatts that you reference and David around the 250 gigawatt pipeline that we have, already have, with the 145 interconnection position secured. I would challenge you to find anybody in the industry that has even close to that that number of projects with interconnection capacity.  And don't forget, given the demand we're seeing in the market, if you have a site ready to go with interconnection capacity, that's the hard part. Finding the customer right now is not the hard part. And so that's why we have such a focus on making sure that our early stage development program is right on track and I feel just terrific about where we stand there today. Let me take the second piece, so that you have which is just about transmission in general. We are not waiting. We are taking the transmission and interconnect issues in our own hands and we are doing that through NextEra Energy transmission. We are laser focused on competitive transmission build out around where our renewable assets are going and where they are going to be built.  We announced a project last quarter, another $400 million opportunity in Cal ISO. I'm not going to talk about them today, but we have a number of various other transmission projects, on the board right now that we are evaluating. That business is going terrific and again, the bottom line message for investors is we're not waiting. We're taking the game, we're taking that into our own hands, that\u2019s why we bought GridLiance. That's why we continue to make investments in that space and we intend to solve those problems ourselves as we go along.\nDavid Arcaro:  Excellent! That's helpful. Thanks so much for all the color. \nJohn Ketchum: Thanks David.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hi! Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to go back to the supply chain and thanks for the commentary there in the earlier question. But just in terms of rate of change from a supply chain perspective relative to recent quarters, are you seeing any divergence between trends and wind projects versus solar projects?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, I mean in terms of wind projects, let me just make a couple of comments there. I mean we do almost all of our businesses with GE. We have done a little bit with Siemens and I know there's been some press on Siemens recently. We don't have any of the Siemen\u2019s Gamesa turbines in our fleet. I just want to make that very clear. As we think about supply chain around wind versus solar, remember that wind turbines are made almost exclusively in the U.S. and so they'll be direct beneficiaries of the manufacturing incentives and we hope domestic content. They have a couple of paperwork things they have to work out with Treasury, which you know hopefully we'll get there on in terms of what kind of information they have to share with their ultimately customers and giving away the secrets to us on margins and all those things, but they continue to work through those issues. But wind just doesn't have the same exposure in the issues that we've had the deal with solar. Around you flip, around circumvention. But again as I said earlier, those issues around solar which really plague the industry back in \u201822 have been things that we've been working through in \u201823 and now we're starting to see a lot more capacity show up, not only in the U.S., but in other markets as well, and so we are capitalizing on all those opportunities and leverage in our buying power as you would expect us to do. \nCarly Davenport: Great. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just a quick one on kind of the cost environment. It seems like it's starting to improve a bit, but still challenging for many. Can you just talk about how your managing costs in this environment and kind of what levers exist that are available to pull if needed to continue to execute at a high level from an earnings perspective. \nJohn Ketchum: Yes, thanks Carly. So, we spoke on our last call about \u2013 and I know you're from there with this. We run a cost savings initiative every year at the company. This year we called it Velocity that we ran under the same name last year and we challenge every one of our business units. It\u2019s a bottoms-up process to come with cost savings ideas for how we run our company. And we've had amazing success through that program over the last 10 years, and in the last two years in fact, if you look at it, we've been able to identify over $700 million of cost savings initiatives, both at FPL and Energy Resources. So we're constantly looking for ways to continue to take cost out of the business; whether it's OEM, whether it's G&A.  And how do we leverage technology? Technology is a big piece of it as well. We recently launched a massive generative AI program that we think also leveraging all the skills that we have around technology, that we've been able to build over the last 10 to 15 years to really leverage AI in a way we never have in terms of how we run the business as well. And so all those things I think are going to contribute to cost declines over time for the business, but we're a laser focused on cost.  And then the development business, when you're selling a commodity, electricity to gain inches, you got to be better than the next developer in line in terms of buying equipment cheaper, building it cheaper, operating cheaper, financing it cheaper. And we have with the A minus balance sheet, you know terrific cost to capital advantage. When we put all those things together, we feel great about our competitive position, our market share and how we continue to progress our renewable development program. \nCarly Davenport: Great! Thanks for that color.\nOperator: Our next question \u2013 pardon me. This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thanks Kristin and good morning. NextEra Energy continued its track record of solid execution as reflected in our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share grew by approximately 8.6% as we deploy capital for the benefit of FPL customers and leverage our competitive advantages to extend Energy Resources for a noble leadership position.  As our fastest growing state in the U.S., Florida has underlying population growth and an economy that continues to drive clear investment needs. For years, FPL strategy has been simple: Keep bills affordable, the grid reliable, and our customer service exceptional.  With our most recent settlement agreement, FPL has a well-established capital plan with clear visibility through 2025 to deliver on this strategy. This quarter we executed our capital plan with new solar and transmission and distribution infrastructure investments, which led to a greater than 12% increase in regulatory capital employed versus the same quarter last year.  As a result, FPL's earnings per share increased by $0.07 year-over-year. We progress these capital initiatives, while keeping customer bills affordable. We continue to run the business efficiently with multiple opportunities to reduce and manage costs. We deploy smart capital that reduces O&M and fuel costs. We embrace innovation and new technologies and we identify cost savings through our various initiatives.  Customers benefit from these actions, including bills that are among the lowest in Florida and well below the national average. FPL is uniquely positioned to extend its best-class customer value proposition and deliver long-term growth.  Energy Resources, more than two decade track record of originating, developing, constructing, and operating renewables remains as strong as ever. This quarter, on the strength of new investments, Energy Resources grew adjusted earnings by over 14% year-over-year. We continue to see solid renewables and storage demand.  Since our first quarter call, Energy Resources placed over 1,800 megawatts into commercial operations. And it's added approximately 1,665 megawatts of new renewable and storage projects to our backlog, which now stands at roughly 20 gigalons, keeping us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.  Given all of our competitive advantages, Energy Resources is uniquely positioned to continue to lead the decolonization of the U.S. economy and be the renewables partner of choice, supporting power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.  We are pleased with the progress we have made at NextEra Energy so far in 2023. For over 18 months we have operated in a challenging macroeconomic environment with various headwinds. And yet, we have leveraged our competitive advantages to serve customers and deliver on our financial expectations.  Through the first half of the year, both businesses have executed well, delivering adjusted EPS growth of approximately 11%. With FPL comprising more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business, our well-established capital plan through 2025 provides investors with long-term growth visibility.  At Energy Resources, we are leveraging our competitive advantages to continue adding new renewables and storage to our backlog, providing clear visibility to our future earnings growth through 2026. Combined, we believe we are well positioned with strong visibility to deliver on our expectations and create long-term value for shareholders.  With that, let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL.  For the second quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of approximately $1.152 billion or $0.57 per share, an increase of $0.07 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 12.1% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 9% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current settlement agreements four year term, which runs through 2025.  FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion for the quarter and we now expect FPL's full year 2023 capital investment to be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion.  For the 12 months ending June 2023, FPLs reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the quarter, we used approximately $78 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of approximately $1 billion.  Our capital projects continue to progress well. As we indicated in our recent 10-year site plan, solar continues to be the lowest cost alternative for our customers. FPL placed into service roughly 225 megawatts of cost effective solar in the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date solar additions to nearly 1,200 megawatts. Over the last two years, FPL has commissioned over 1,600 megawatts of new solar generation. With two and a half years remaining under the current settlement agreement, FPL expects to add roughly 3,100 megawatts of incremental solar through 2025. FPL solar investments allow us to serve strong customer growth, while providing clean, affordable generation and avoiding volatile fuel purchases.  Over the current four year settlement agreement, we continue to expect FPL with a capital investment of between $32 billion to $34 billion. Of that total, we anticipate investing approximately $10 billion in new solar generation and approximately $14 billion to $16 billion in transmission and distribution infrastructure. We remain confident in our total capital plan through 2025, as our cumulative capital investments of approximately $14 billion through June of 2023 are a little ahead of our original timeline.  Our capital investment plan is well-established and by executing on solar deployment and transmission and distribution investments, we are enhancing what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in the industry.  I'll turn now to the Florida Economy, which continues to demonstrate strong growth. Over the past year, Florida has created roughly 412,000 new private sector jobs, and its unemployment rate continues to decline, currently standing at approximately 2.6%, which is nearly 30% below the U.S. average. Florida consumer sentiment improved roughly 14% compared to the prior year and remains above the U.S. average, while mortgage delinquency rates decline by 55 basis points compared to the prior year. Florida's GDP continues to trend upward, an increase over 9% versus a year ago.  During the quarter, FPL had solid customer growth with the average number of customers increasing by more than 66,000 from the comparable prior year period. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased by approximately 0.3% year-over-year. We estimate that weather had a slightly negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 0.3% on a year-over-year basis.  After taking these factors into account, second quarter retail sales increased roughly 0.6% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued solid underlying population growth.  Now let's turn to Energy Resources, where second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings, we're approximately $1.462 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter we're approximately $781 million dollars or $0.39 per share, which is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 year-over-year.  Contributions from new investments increased $0.10 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.06 per share. This decline was mostly due to a large swing in year-over-year wind resource.  This quarter was the lowest second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.09 per share, primarily due to higher margins in our customer facing businesses, compared to a relatively weak contribution in the prior year quarter.  All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.09 per share. This decline reflects higher interest cost of $0.06 per share, half of which is driven by new borrowing costs to support new investments and half of which is due to higher interest rates. The remaining impact is due to a combination of other factors, including additional costs to support early stage renewable development investments as we plan for growth in the latter part of the decade.  Energy Resources had a solid quarter of new renewables and storage origination adding approximately 1,665 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now tolls roughly 20 gigawatts, after taking into account over 1,800 megawatts of new projects placed into service since our first quarter call, which keeps us on track to achieve our renewable development expectations through 2026.  Having shared our new expectations just six months ago, we are already within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range and only need roughly 15 gigawatts over the next three and 1.5 years to achieve the midpoint of the 2023 to 2026 development expectations range.  As part of our backlog addition, this quarter we signed our first contract for a standalone battery storage project co-located with an existing wind facility. The 65 megawatts storage project is expected to serve our customers growing capacity needs in the southwest power pool and be available to monetize pricing arbitrage opportunities in this renewable rich area of the country.  As we have highlighted, we believe there are many more opportunities to monetize the value of our existing 29 gigawatts operating renewables portfolio, including deploying co-located storage like we did here. We are excited to bring facility into commercial operation.  During the quarter we continue to see solid demand for renewables and storage across power and commercial and industrial customers. After a period of underlying commodity price inflation, supply chain disruption and trade policy risk premiums, we are finally seeing signs of stability, which will be helpful in our customer conversations. We believe renewables remain economically attractive to alternative forms of generation, and position ourselves to meet long-term customer demand by expanding our significant pipeline of renewable projects.  Today, we have a pipeline of roughly 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage projects in various stages of development. This includes projects in early stage diligence in our current backlog, and is supported by roughly 145 gigawatts of interconnection queue positions. When you combine our significant competitive advantages with our renewable pipeline, we believe Energy Resources is well positioned for growth and our renewable business for years to come.  We also remain excited about the opportunity to serve hydrogen customers by leveraging our best-in-class renewables development expertise and early stage development position. Throughout the quarter we continue to advocate for smart hydrogen policy that we believe would help the U.S. establish a robust green hydrogen market and drive increased renewables penetration.  We also progress our pipeline of potential green hydrogen opportunities by executing an additional memorandum of understanding to explore developing green hydrogen and related facilities that would integrate into our customers' operations and serve their energy needs.  Hydrogen should be thought of as simply another renewables customer class, and as all our hydrogen related projects could potentially translate into additional new renewables, and with the appropriate regulations, begin to contribute to Energy Resources growth later this decade.  Turning now to our consolidated results. For the second quarter of 2023, GAAP earnings attributed to NextEra Energy were approximately $2.795 billion or $1.38 per share. NextEra Energy recorded approximately $1.777 billion of adjusted earnings and $0.88 cents of adjusted EPS in the second quarter.  Adjusted earnings from the corporate and other segment decreased results by $0.04 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. We continue to proactively manage interest rates in multiple ways. First, NextEra Energy has $16 billion of various interest rate swaps to help mitigate the impact of future increases in rate.  Second, FPL has features in its settlement agreement to offset higher interest rates such as reserve amortization and the ROE adjustment mechanism, which became effective on September 1, 2022 due to a sustained rise in the 30 year U.S. Treasury yield.  Finally, our focus on continuous improvement through our annual velocity productivity initiative has yielded over $725 million in annual run rate savings ideas. Over the last two years, creating cost savings opportunities to help offset higher interest costs. As always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations.  Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges. In each year, from 2023 to 2026, while the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.  From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year, through at least 2024, off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions. Now, I'd like to turn to NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were $486 million and $200 million respectively, reflecting weaker wind resource. NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to deliver on its 2023 run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.  Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.854 per share per common unit or $3.42 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 12% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit over 355% since the IPO.  Since our last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners completed its previously announced acquisition of approximately 690 megawatts of wind and solar assets. With this acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners renewable portfolio is over 10,000 megawatts. Further strengthening its position as the world's seventh largest producer of electricity from the wind and sun. The partnership is well-positioned to execute on its simplification plan to become a 100% renewables focus company.  Regarding this simplification plan, in May we launched the sales process for the Texas Natural Gas Pipeline portfolio and are pleased with our progress is we remain on track to sell the assets by later this year. NextEra Energy Partners expects to use the proceeds from the planned Texas Pipeline portfolio sales together with a mean natural gas pipeline sale in 2025 to eliminate the equity buyouts on the three near-term convertible equity portfolio financing. STX Midstream and EP Renewables 2, and 2019 NEP Pipelines. Upon successful execution of the Texas pipeline portfolio sell, the partnership does not expect to require equity through 2024, other than opportunistic equity issuances under our at the market equity program to fund future growth beyond 2024.  Now to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of $486 million and $200 million respectively, reflecting the adverse impacts of weaker wind resource. The adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $99 million and $39 million respectively, primarily driven by a large swing in year-over-year wind resource. This quarter was the lowest-second quarter of wind resource on record over the past 30 years, while last year was the highest.  New projects contributed approximately $49 million of adjusted EBITDA and $5 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter results for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution were positively impacted by the Incentive Distribution Rights Fee Suspension and provided approximately $38 million of benefit this quarter, partially offsetting the impact of poor wind resource performance.  As we previously shared, we expect strong double-digit growth in the second half of the year and adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, LP distribution per unit growth expectations range for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.  From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year and LP distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. However, as we previously shared with you, we expect to grow at or near the bottom end of that range. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February of 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit.  NextEra Energy Partners continue to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution and its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023 to be in the ranges of $2.2 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023. As always, our expectations subject to our usual caveats, including normal weather and operating conditions.  In summary, we believe that NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders and unit holders. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple: Our two businesses are deploying capital and renewables and transmission for the benefit of customers providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. At FPL, we're executing on our well-established capital investment plan, which allows us to extend our customer value proposition.  Florida's strong population growth drives smart capital investment and running the business efficiently allows us to manage costs for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. FPL comprises more than two-thirds of NextEra Energy's business and provides a significant amount of visibility into capital deployment and earnings growth.  At Energy Resources, we're leveraging our more than 20 years of experience, competitive advantages to grow our market share and add to our now roughly 20 gigawatts backlog, providing terrific growth visibility through 2026. We believe these competitive advantages will enable Energy Resources to serve power, commercial and industrial, and eventually hydrogen customers.  With an opportunity set of $20 billion of capital investment, requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables, Energy Resources is well-positioned to be green hydrogen partner of choice, potentially creating new opportunities toward the end of the decade.  At NextEra Energy Partners we are executing on our plans to sell our natural gas pipelines and simplify the business. We continue to add to our renewables and storage portfolio, which now stands at over 10,000 megawatts. With the sale of the Texas Natural Gas Pipeline portfolio expected to be completed by the end of the year, NextEra Energy Partners remains on track to transition to a 100% pure play renewables company, while continuing to deliver LP distribution per unit growth for unit holders.  With that, we're happy to answer your questions. Yeah, we are. I mean, first of all let me just comment on the valuations that you see. I mean, I think that \u2013 look, I'm not going to be critical on some of the assets that have come to sale. But, if you read through the lines and into the details of the structures of those transactions, those are not characterized as high quality renewable assets.  When you look back at what we have developed over the last 20 years and what we continue to develop are very high quality renewable assets. Most of them are bus bar. They are with high credit counterparty off-takers. They are well situated in areas that benefit from our data analytics around transmission congestion, wind resource, solar resource. Because we have 20 years of experience, I like to believe and look, we are perfect, but we don't make some of the same mistakes that you see some of the other developers make.  And so I feel like we're much better positioned. Our portfolio is in much better position than some of the other markers that you have seen. So I'd be very, very careful on how you assess portfolio to portfolio, because they are very, very different.  The second thing I would say is, we look at all third-party M&A opportunities that come available and we feel like we do have all the competitive advantages, you know some of what you mentioned. We buy cheap, we build cheap, we operate cheap, we have a cost-capable advantage. We have a terrific team that really understands how to optimize the value of existing assets, that's the key piece.  Repowering assets is something we've always had a very strong track record at. It's something that the rest of the industry has struggled with and that gives us a real leg up in terms of being able to see values that others don't. And then as Kirk mentioned on the call today, we have a benefit and an organic asset that nobody else has, which is the largest fleet in North America that we operate.  And so we have the ability not only to repower those existing assets, but to find ways to pair them up with storage and take advantage of the stand-alone storage ITC. As you all know, storage used to only be a unique opportunity to pair with solar. The rules of change with the stand-alone storage ITC under IRA. So now we can pair it with wind, we can build a stand-alone. We're making a lot of progress in that area.  We announced one project today where we are starting to see an opportunity, particularly in MISO and SPP, in ERCOT, where capacity values and reliability are being priced higher than what we've seen them in the past, given some of the shortfalls that they have in those markets and that just happens to coincide with where most of our wind is.  And given the massive existing fleet that we have, which very importantly includes an existing interconnection agreement, our ability to go and pair those assets up with solar or to repower them is unique in this industry given the two-decade head start that we have. And so that's a value that we try to bring to M&A opportunities as well when we exercise our other competitive advantages, including our cost-to-capable advantage."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Yeah, sure Steve. This is John Ketchum and a good morning to you as well. In the customer supply and trading business, we're just seeing a lot less competition, number one. And number two, remember, a lot of \u2013 most of the business activity that we do in that group is customer facing business. Our full requirements business for example, where we're working with municipalities and cooperatives to help provide their power needs and arrange the capacity and ancillaries and other regulatory requirements that need to manage their business, particularly up in the North East.  That business, because it's had a lot less competition, it has benefited from significant margins. And please, you know one of the points I want to make is, these arrangements that we enter into in the full requirements business are typically two or three years and we're immediately going at them back to back, hedging those positions. So feel great about the risk profile, and again, terrific margins that really match up well with their skill sets, our competitive advantages and our core operations. So that's really the main driver.  And I also want to remind folks that when you think about our customer and supply business we run it at a very, very low bar. For example, the last quarter we ran that business roughly at a 2% bar. So it's very, very small business, risk exposure overall for PMI. Steve, one other point I want to make too on the customer supply business is that that business, historically you can go back 10 years and the customer supply and trading business, including this year has never contributed more than 10% of NextEra Energies net income and I think that's important to keep in mind as well. We run a \u2013 we have a lot of complementary businesses. Obviously, FPL has done well. We have other complementary businesses that Energy Resources on top of our renewable business. But that business has always stayed under 10% and that's one of the commitments that we make to the rating agencies, and that's true this year as well. Yeah, we have been very vocal around the hydrogen regulations that need to come together and there's been a debate for those that are familiar with it, between whether we have hourly matching or annual matching. And for us it's very simple, as part of a hydrogen project you buy an expensive asset called an electrolyzer, which everyone is familiar with. And if you have hourly matching, the net capacity factor, the number of hours a day that you use that electrolyzer are probably less than half the day in most parts of the country.  If you have an annual construct, we're able to use that electrolyzer around the clock and so it's really easy math. I mean, when you have an expensive capital asset and you can use it around the clock, the price of green hydrogen is going to be a lot lower if you can only use it less than half a time.  And so the industry has come forward with a very constructive proposal, which would have the hourly matching construct not kick in until 2028. You'd have annual until that time period and we also have supported the fact that you have to have additionality if you're going to go qualify for annuals.  So if you're qualifying for annual in the hours that the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining the power, the electrolyzer behind the meter and you are buying off the grid. Well, you're buying from an additional renewable asset that has been constructed and developed to provide electrons to that newly built hydrogen facility. So from an NGO perspective, you're getting additional decarbonization benefits on the grid.  So we think we've been very constructive in what we have come forward with. We think it's really important, because we want to send the right price signal to OEMs to ramp up production on electrolyzers, because electrolyzers being produced at scale is going to be critically important to declines in green hydrogen prices over time. And so that's where we are in terms of your question around timing. We expect Treasury to probably come out with regulations now. We're hoping for August, but it's starting to sound more like September or October.  But again, we have built a significant hydrogen pipeline, parts of it work on either construct and that pipeline is well over $20 billion and we have the land team out and we've had them out, very aggressively lining up land positions for our hydrogen portfolio that the nice thing about that and which Kirk said it in the remarks, that pipeline is now about 250 gigawatts when you include early due diligence sites.  Nobody in our industry has a pipeline like that, nobody, and what's terrific about it is it can be used for dual purpose, because hydrogen customers are just a third customer class to sell renewables to. So if the site doesn't work for hydrogen, it will work for our power or C&I customers.  So I feel like we're really well positioned and hydrogen is one of those things that can really provide a nice boom to the development expectations that we've already laid out for you. So we're eager to see what the final regulations say. But I also want to remind folks that hydrogen has a long development cycle, so the contribution that we'll see from hydrogen investments you would expect over the latter part of the decade. Yeah, thank you Steve. So let me take those in order. So in terms of timing, we would hope to be in a position, in the end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter in order to support that end of the year sales timeline that we have earmarked.  In terms of valuation, we view these assets as unique. Again as a reminder, the Texas pipelines provide 25% of the natural gas supply to Mexico through contracts with Pemex, and the other pipeline assets that support the Texas pipeline are fully integrated with that pipe, and they provide gas to Mexico, through (inaudible), which is a very liquid trading point. And if you look around that area, these are very, very strategic for a number of players.  So again, as you all know, it's hard to compare one pipe comp to another, but again, we remain pleased with the progress that we continue to make on the sales transaction. Thank you, Steve. Oh! And Steve. I think I said 2% on the bar, I meant $2 million on the bar for PMI, just correct that. Thank you. Good morning, Shah. Yeah, thank you Shah for the question. No new developments and there's really no new news there. Again, we would expect just based on historical precedent with the FTC that we would hear back where they have a reasonable belief that they should investigate, probably sometime in the first quarter of 2024. Thank you, Shah. Yeah, good question, Julien. So let me just start with \u2013 take that in chunks, because everyone knows our development expectations are \u201823 to \u201826. So let's just start with the first two years and then we'll talk about the second two years.  So for \u201823 through \u201824, we are in great shape. We are already within the range as we had expected to be. And then on \u201825 and \u201826, you know if you go back to the beginning of \u201822, and you add up where we are today, we've already added 12 gigawatts just in the last six quarters. That puts us in great shape against \u201825 and \u201826, because now we have 15 gigawatts to get to the midpoint and if you kind of work backwards from \u201826, that's 3.5 years to get 15 gigawatts.  So we feel like we are really in great position and on track on that build. And I think there's some real tailwinds that we're going to start to see come forward and I want to explain some dynamics, you know just around what we've seen in the renewable industry, which was part of your question Julien.  Let's just go back to \u201822. I mean, in \u201822 we saw a lot of supply chain issues that started to surface. And then we saw here a flip, we saw circumvention and that cost them delays. It also cost us outages supply, because some developers are scrambling for panels that they thought they could get into the country, which I think for a short period of time drove prices up.  The great thing is, all those 22 projects that got delayed in to \u201823 are now starting to go into commercial operation. That's a really good news, good news for customers, because those customers that were digesting that \u201822 build and waiting for those projects to go COD in to \u201823 are now coming back to the market. And so we're seeing really strong demand from those folks as we start to look forward.  The other benefit of that is as you see you flip up, as you start to get works work through. We're not seeing that you flip awhole back that we used to see, so we're making a lot of progress on that front. When you take that into account with the clarity that we're now seeing around circumvention, we finally have this bright line rule with the six-part test and as long as you meet four of the six, and you're importing from Southeast Asia, you're okay. And so what we've seen is a relaxation in pricing as a result of that. So now the risk premium that was being charged last year by the import market is starting to come down.  The other terrific phenomenon that we're seeing around solar pricing is that Southeast Asia still sets the price for panels in the U.S., but as that risk price premium is starting to come down and Southeast Asia really wants a big part of the U.S. market. Why do they want a big part of the U.S. market? They sell panels for $0.20 everywhere else, right? They've been selling panels for $0.40 roughly in the U.S. So they have a lot of room to move.  And so as that risk premium comes down around, you flip in and circumvention is forcing prices down in the U.S. At the same time you're seeing a lot more U.S. supply come online through new module facilities are getting announced, also through cell facilities that will come along with it. And so the bottom line is when you look at the solar picture, it's favorable from an equipped price standpoint, because I think you're starting to see a lot of capacity come online that is going to force prices down over time, particularly as you see the U.S. market evolve.  And it's no secret with some of the economic data coming out of China that some of those Southeast Asian markets are under pressure with capacity, excess capacity positions, and so they've got batteries and panels they need to find things to do with. Battery prices are coming down as well. We're finally seeing a relaxation in battery prices. Really struggling to see \u2013 really struggling in the EV market in China, which has created very much in excess capacity around batteries and so we're finally starting to see some relaxation there. I think there's been more of a movement around traditional lithium ion and some of the rare mineral exposure you see there, sodium and other battery forms, and so very encouraged about the landscape there.  And then on the wind OEM side, the wind folks are really one of the only ones that can reap the full benefit of domestic content and the full manufacturer incentive. So we feel really good about where wind sits as well.  So I think as you start to look forward and we started to move through these supply chain issues you saw in \u201822 of these projects coming online in \u201823 come combined with excess capacity globally around the supply chain, we feel great there. And let me talk about transferability for a second. There's been a lot of discussion and I've heard a lot of questions about folks saying, well, how is transferability going to be accounted for? And is it going to be part of the FFO and in the FFO-to-debt metric.  We feel very good and we've told investors for a long time that we feel very good that it's in accordance with GAAP, it flows through the tax line for tax credits that get transferred, to be included and so we feel good about where that is heading and that will end up in a good place there on that FFO-to-debt question that has surfaced around transferability.  So when you put all those pieces together, as we've worked through some of these headwinds that we've had, we feel very good about where things are heading and let's just face it, we're just getting started. Renewables are here to stay, they're not going anywhere. And so while we might \u2013 you know the development process isn't always going to be a straight line, we're in terrific shape and feel very optimistic about the future. Yeah, a lot of it is going to depend on, as I said before, these \u201822 projects continuing to come online in 2023 and those customers that had a little bit of fatigue so to speak. We are around those delays coming back to market which we're starting to see and so that will be the wild card. But we feel good about how the rest of the year continues to shape up. And Julien, one of the things to add to that is, it's hydrogen. We get the right rules there and again I can't stress it enough. I mean we've always only had two customer classes for renewable. It's been power sector, it's been the C&I sector. Now with the right rules, we have the potential to add a third customer class, which is the renewables for hydrogen customers and that's exciting as well. Yes, I think that's right. And then remember, those projects that have longer lead time development cycles. So in terms of the contribution that investors should expect, it's going to come in the latter part of the decade. Yes, I mean for NEP, first of all the focus is on the simplification strategy which we shared with the market back in May and we have said that our expectation as a result of that is, we don't \u2013 you know assuming a successful execution on that sale, that we don't expect to have equity requirements in 2024, other than opportunistic equity issuances under our ATM to help finance growth beyond 2024.  But if you look, and you can see in the slides here, that we have a lot of flexibility under our current metrics with the agencies, in terms of the ability to add additional, what I would call traditional debt based capital market financing, mechanisms to accommodate the growth going forward.  And we are very busy looking at the back end, three sublets that we have and some ideas around how we are going to address those as well. Because when we move on from the simplification transaction, that's going to be the next point of focus. We are not \u2013 but we're not waiting. We are continuing to look at that.  And look, there continues to be a strong bid for an interest in renewable interest, in renewable assets long term. Particularly when you think about the opportunity to do that with the world leader in renewable development, with the competitive advantages that we have, the 20 gigawatt backline log. The growth visibility that NEP has going forward, all very promising. And so we could continue to engage in those discussions as well as we think about the future. Yes, so let me take that in two pieces. I mean one is the 145 gigawatts that you reference and David around the 250 gigawatt pipeline that we have, already have, with the 145 interconnection position secured. I would challenge you to find anybody in the industry that has even close to that that number of projects with interconnection capacity.  And don't forget, given the demand we're seeing in the market, if you have a site ready to go with interconnection capacity, that's the hard part. Finding the customer right now is not the hard part. And so that's why we have such a focus on making sure that our early stage development program is right on track and I feel just terrific about where we stand there today. Let me take the second piece, so that you have which is just about transmission in general. We are not waiting. We are taking the transmission and interconnect issues in our own hands and we are doing that through NextEra Energy transmission. We are laser focused on competitive transmission build out around where our renewable assets are going and where they are going to be built.  We announced a project last quarter, another $400 million opportunity in Cal ISO. I'm not going to talk about them today, but we have a number of various other transmission projects, on the board right now that we are evaluating. That business is going terrific and again, the bottom line message for investors is we're not waiting. We're taking the game, we're taking that into our own hands, that's why we bought GridLiance. That's why we continue to make investments in that space and we intend to solve those problems ourselves as we go along. Thanks David. Yes, I mean in terms of wind projects, let me just make a couple of comments there. I mean we do almost all of our businesses with GE. We have done a little bit with Siemens and I know there's been some press on Siemens recently. We don't have any of the Siemen's Gamesa turbines in our fleet. I just want to make that very clear. As we think about supply chain around wind versus solar, remember that wind turbines are made almost exclusively in the U.S. and so they'll be direct beneficiaries of the manufacturing incentives and we hope domestic content. They have a couple of paperwork things they have to work out with Treasury, which you know hopefully we'll get there on in terms of what kind of information they have to share with their ultimately customers and giving away the secrets to us on margins and all those things, but they continue to work through those issues. But wind just doesn't have the same exposure in the issues that we've had the deal with solar. Around you flip, around circumvention. But again as I said earlier, those issues around solar which really plague the industry back in \u201822 have been things that we've been working through in \u201823 and now we're starting to see a lot more capacity show up, not only in the U.S., but in other markets as well, and so we are capitalizing on all those opportunities and leverage in our buying power as you would expect us to do. Yes, thanks Carly. So, we spoke on our last call about \u2013 and I know you're from there with this. We run a cost savings initiative every year at the company. This year we called it Velocity that we ran under the same name last year and we challenge every one of our business units. It's a bottoms-up process to come with cost savings ideas for how we run our company. And we've had amazing success through that program over the last 10 years, and in the last two years in fact, if you look at it, we've been able to identify over $700 million of cost savings initiatives, both at FPL and Energy Resources. So we're constantly looking for ways to continue to take cost out of the business; whether it's OEM, whether it's G&A.  And how do we leverage technology? Technology is a big piece of it as well. We recently launched a massive generative AI program that we think also leveraging all the skills that we have around technology, that we've been able to build over the last 10 to 15 years to really leverage AI in a way we never have in terms of how we run the business as well. And so all those things I think are going to contribute to cost declines over time for the business, but we're a laser focused on cost.  And then the development business, when you're selling a commodity, electricity to gain inches, you got to be better than the next developer in line in terms of buying equipment cheaper, building it cheaper, operating cheaper, financing it cheaper. And we have with the A minus balance sheet, you know terrific cost to capital advantage. When we put all those things together, we feel great about our competitive position, our market share and how we continue to progress our renewable development program."

Adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 13.5% year-over-year building on the success of last year's strong execution and financial performance. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in our sector on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies for the 16th time in 17 years. We are extremely proud of the team and culture we have built that has enabled us to deliver low-cost clean and reliable power to our customers, while also providing long-term value to our shareholders. FPL is the largest electric utility in the US and Florida is now officially the fastest-growing state in America. At FPL, our focus remains the same deploying smart capital to deliver on what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in our industry. Key to that strategy is keeping customer bills affordable. And this quarter, we proposed using projected 2023 fuel savings to reduce unbilled fuel costs from 2022 to provide bill relief to customers. To further manage fuel price volatility, we are also helping customers by adding more solar to the FPL grid. This quarter, we placed into service approximately 970 megawatts of new low-cost solar. Putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at nearly 4,600 megawatts, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. We believe solar is now the lowest cost generation option for Florida customers, but represents only about 5% of FPL's delivered energy. In order to extend the benefits of low-cost solar to customers, FPL's recently filed 10-year site plan, now includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of new solar. Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, remains laser-focused on executing a strategy of decarbonizing the power sector and helping commercial and industrial customers outside the power sector, reduce their energy cost and decarbonize their operations by moving to low-cost renewables and other clean energy solutions. This quarter, Energy Resources added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. Energy Resources also closed on its previously announced acquisition of a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, providing the foundation for our growing RNG business. We are also excited to announce a new memorandum of understanding with CF Industries to create green hydrogen, establishing what we expect will be a long-term relationship with the world's largest ammonium producer. And finally, Energy Resources continues to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business to help support growth in renewables. We are pleased to announce that the California ISO recently recommended for approval approximately $400 million in new transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission. We believe, NextEra Energy continues to be anchored by two great businesses that leverage each other's expertise to make them even better. We do not believe anyone in our industry has our set of skills, scale and breadth of opportunities. We believe NextEra Energy is able to buy, build operate and finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. We also believe our best-in-class development skills and unparalleled data set enable us to provide innovative technology and low-cost clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. The opportunities and products demanded by the market are becoming more complex, requiring significant scale and a combination of skills that we believe few of our competitors can offer, further enhancing our competitive advantages and creating even more growth opportunities for our business going forward. We have a culture rooted and continuous improvement, always striving to be better. Along those lines, we just completed our annual employee-led productivity initiative, which we now call Velocity. For over 11 years, our employees have generated approximately $2.6 billion in annual run rate savings ideas, as part of this process. In 2023 alone, our team generated ideas expected to produce roughly $325 million in annual run rate savings, which when combined with last year's results of over $400 million is the most productive two-year period in this program's history and that's after doing it for over a decade. We believe we have the best team in the industry, and these results are indicative of the breadth and depth of capabilities and the commitment to excellence that our team brings to our business every day and executing on behalf of our customers and shareholders. With that let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of $1.07 billion, or $0.53 per share an increase of $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.2% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2023 capital investments at FPL to be between $8.0 billion and $9.0 billion, as we continue to invest capital smartly for the continued benefit of our customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ending March 2023. During the quarter, we utilized $373 million of reserve amortization to achieve our targeted regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $1.07 billion. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs from 2022 partially offset by projected 2023 fuel savings of approximately $1.4 billion. Amid high natural gas prices in 2022, FPL's decades-long modernization of its generation fleet has saved customers more than $2 billion in fuel costs in 2022 alone. The commission also recently approved recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of hurricane costs from 2022 over a 12-month period. Taking all approved adjustments together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills will remain well below the projected national average and among the lowest of all Florida utilities. Turning to our development planning and efforts. FPL recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our generation resource plan for the next decade. The 2023 plan includes roughly 20,000 megawatts of new low-cost solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years, which would result in nearly 35% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2032 coming from cost-effective solar generation up significantly from roughly 5% in 2022. Given the increasing customer benefits of low-cost renewables FPL's post-2025 solar capacity additions and this year's plan are more than double last year's approved plan and also includes 2 gigawatts of battery storage over the next decade. We believe the expansion of cost-effective solar and storage will provide a valuable hedge for our customers against volatile natural gas prices and meet the electricity demand of FPL's growing customer base with a low-cost generation source. Finally, construction of our green hydrogen pilot at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center is on track and projected to go into service later this year. Turning now to the Florida economy. Florida became the fastest-growing state in the nation in 2022 and its population continues to increase with over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. Over the last five years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 7% compound annual growth rate and is now approximately $1.4 trillion which is up approximately 8% versus a year ago. Based on GDP, if Florida was a country, it would have the 14th largest economy in the world. FPL's first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% from the prior year comparable period driven by continued solid underlying population growth with FPL's average number of customers increasing by approximately 65,000, even after removing roughly 15,000 inactive customers due to Hurricane Ian. For the first quarter, we estimate that the positive impact of warmer weather was more than offset by a decline in underlying usage for our customers. As we have often pointed out, underlying usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, particularly during periods when temperatures deviate significantly from normal, as we experienced this winter with average temperatures greater than four degrees above normal. Our long-term expectations of underlying usage growth continues to average between zero and approximately negative 0.5% per year. Energy Resources report first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of approximately $1.440 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $732 million or $0.36 per share up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. Contributions from new investments increased $0.07 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing Clean Energy portfolio were lower by $0.03 per share primarily due to less favorable wind and solar resource compared to the prior year. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.06 per share primarily due to higher margin in our customer-facing business and compared to a relatively weaker contribution in the prior year comparable quarter. Gas infrastructure and all other impacts reduced earnings by $0.01 and $0.05 per share respectively versus 2022. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination capitalizing on strong global demand environment. Since the last call, we added approximately 2020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog including roughly 1370 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of storage and 200 megawatts of wind. With these additions, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at over 20.4 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into our future growth. With more than 1.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we are now within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range. Given the volatility in gas and power prices over the last 1.5 years, we continue to see economics driving long-term decision-making and renewables remain the clear low-cost option for many customers. On the supply -- solar supply chain front, we continue to take constructive steps to mitigate potential future disruption. Nearly every one of our suppliers has repositioned their supply chains to manufacture solar panels in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China, and all our suppliers are expected to meet the criteria established in the Commerce Department's preliminary determination in the 2022 circumvention case by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are focused on further diversifying our supply chain and are currently advancing discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Finally, we are encouraged by the improvement in the flow of panels into the US as suppliers continue to provide the requested traceability documentation to US Customs and Border Protection. Also, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities that I mentioned earlier. The approximately $1.1 billion transaction represents an attractive opportunity for energy resources to realize double-digit returns on this investment, while expanding its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and growing its in-house capabilities and rapidly expanding renewable fuel market. Turning to green hydrogen, we are excited about the role it is expected to play as a solution to help our customers cost effectively lower emissions. As the world leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, we believe we are the logical partner for green hydrogen with significant interconnection and land inventory positions and deep market expertise to help our potential partners optimize some of the best green hydrogen sites around the country. As a result, with the right regulation, we see hydrogen quickly becoming a significant technology for our customers and a new growth driver for energy resources given the number and size of the opportunities we are evaluating. Earlier this month, NextEra Energy joined a coalition of 45 other companies with a combined approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization and sending a letter to the Secretaries of Energy & Treasury and the White House advocating for programmatic policies for the implementation of the IRAs green hydrogen production tax credit. This coalition is advocating for prudent policy that will foster investment in green hydrogen technology paving the way for the US to become the world leader in hydrogen technology. A key aspect of this policy is for the electricity consumed for green hydrogen production to be matched to its renewable power generation on an annual rather than an hourly basis. We believe that an annual matching construct has several benefits over hourly including lower green hydrogen prices, more renewables being built, a significant reduction in carbon emissions, and green hydrogen achieving cost parity with gray and blue hydrogen both of which rely on fossil fuels for their production. This viewpoint is supported by numerous third-party studies from respected entities such as Wood Mackenzie, Rhodium Group, Energy Futures Initiative, Energy and Environmental Economics, and MIT Energy Institute. As we continue to work with the industry and government representatives to progress a smart hydrogen policy, we are also advancing our green hydrogen development efforts including a recently executed Memorandum of Understanding for a joint venture with CF Industries, the world's largest producer of ammonia to develop -- to deliver green hydrogen to an existing CF Industries ammonia production facility which it intends to expand and incorporate green hydrogen into its production process. The proposed facility includes an approximately 450-megawatt renewable energy solution, powering a 40 tons per day hydrogen facility. This project combined with other opportunities we are pursuing represent significant momentum for green hydrogen, which we believe will continue to be a driver of new renewables growth going forward. Our team continues to engage with multiple potential partners and customers on hydrogen projects, representing over $20 billion of capital investments and requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables to support. As we focus on leading the decarbonization of the US economy, building additional transmission is essential to support long-term renewables deployment. We believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission as a key competitive advantage for our renewables business, in addition to being a terrific investment opportunity. We are pleased that the California ISO recently recommended for approval of approximately $400 million in transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission, subject to approval by the CAISO Board of Governors in May. We believe these projects along with others could unlock up to 11 gigawatts of new renewable generation that could be built to support California's ambitious clean energy goals. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2023 GAAP earnings attributable to NextEra Energy were $2.086 billion or $1.04 per share. NextEra Energy's 2023 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.678 billion and $0.84 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings for the Corporate and Other segment decreased results by $0.03 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest rates. In March, S&P affirmed all its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 20% to the current level of 18%. In making this favorable adjustment, S&P acknowledged improvement in Energy Resources business risk following the passage of the IRA, particularly noting the improved visibility and clarity into long-term cash flows. At the same time, S&P adjusted its treatment of non-recourse project debt associated with FERC Regulated investments to bring it back on credit. We believe this overall favorable adjustment, which creates roughly 50 bps of additional headroom against the downgrade threshold, highlights the attractive risk profile of renewables and acknowledges the long-term stable cash flows and Energy Resources business, particularly given the benefits of the IRA. Finally as we have discussed in the past, we actively enter into various interest rate swaps products to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuance. Today, we have $21 billion of interest rate swaps at NextEra Energy to help mitigate the impact of potential future increases in rates, which exceeds the notional value of our 2023 and 2024 maturities. And as always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations which we extended earlier this year through 2026 remain unchanged. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. From 2021 to 2026, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. We believe, we have never had more visible growth opportunities than we have today. We have the ability to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from Energy Resources, growing organically and buying assets from other third parties. With significant tailwinds from the IRA, Energy Resources' operating portfolio, combined with its backlog of projects and development expectations through 2026, total approximately 58 gigawatts, providing terrific visibility for NextEra Energy Partners and Energy Resources is continuing to grow in innovative ways, adding new technologies and clean energy assets to its portfolio, such as RNG and hydrogen. In addition to acquiring assets from Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners also has the ability to repower its existing assets, with approximately 1,300 megawatts of potential wind repowerings, already identified, and many more opportunities expected to come, as well as potential to locate storage at its existing renewable assets, given the new stand-alone storage ITC. Finally, there are significant acquisition opportunities with renewable portfolios, continuously being brought to market. NextEra Energy Partners also has numerous ways that can finance this growth and we believe, it can do so efficiently, given its ample liquidity and access to capital. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners had $2.8 billion of liquidity and approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps to manage future interest rate volatility on debt maturities through 2026. With regard to convertible equity portfolio financing, we can fund equity buyouts by delivering common units or utilizing our at-the-market or ATM program or a combination of both and we believe we have ample liquidity to fund cash payments. Importantly, we have flexibility and we expect to leverage this flexibility to manage future buyouts to select the most efficient option. Using this flexibility, NextEra Energy Partners has now bought out 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing through funds generated from a combination of the ATM program, where NextEra Energy Partners was able to be opportunistic and cash from a subsidiary's revolving credit facility. With the buyouts of the 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing and 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing complete, we estimate that the convertible equity portfolio financing structure has resulted in approximately 55% and 64% respectively or 16 million fewer units being issued, compared to raising capital with underwritten block equity, all for the benefit of unitholders. For the balance of the year, files are now expected to be limited to the remaining 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity [ph] portfolio financing and 15% of the net renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing with the equity portion of these buyouts requiring common units of approximately $280 million and $130 million respectively. Over the next eight months, we have flexibility and time to opportunistically manage these buyouts in the most efficient way. For each buyout, we have the flexibility to deliver common units to the convertible equity portfolio financing investor, utilize the ATM program or some combination of the two. Ultimately, we will select the most efficient option. In any event, the potential unit issuance from these buyouts are not expected to exceed an average of three days of total trading volume per quarter, which we expect will make them quite manageable. Most importantly, NextEra Energy Partners' growth expectations through 2026 already factor in its financing plan, including convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts at current trading yields. Turning to distribution growth. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8425 per common unit or $3.37 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit up nearly 350% since the IPO. Today we are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 690-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind and solar projects and attractive cash available for distribution yield. The high-quality portfolio has a cash available for distribution, weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 16 years, an average customer credit rating of BBB at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's Investors Service. NextEra Energy Partners is expected to acquire the portfolio for approximately $708 million, subject to closing adjustments and is inclusive of the portfolio's existing project debt and interest rate swaps which are estimated to be approximately $142 million. In addition to the approximately $708 million purchase price, NextEra Energy Partners is also expected to assume the portfolio's existing tax equity financing balance. The remaining purchase price is expected to be funded by a combination of new project finance debt and the corporate revolving credit facility. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million to $130 million and cash available for distribution prior to the existing project debt service of approximately $62 million to $72 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis, beginning December 31 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEnergy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Next Energy Partners will remain opportunistic pursuing acquisitions in 2023. And with the closing of the transaction announced today, NextEnergy Partners expects to be well positioned to meet its year-end 2023 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution results in line with management's expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $447 million increased by $35 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by favorable contributions from the approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new projects acquired in 2022. Both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were negatively affected by lower resource from existing projects. Additionally, cash available from distribution was lower versus the prior year comparable period due to incremental debt service and timing of payable payments. Looking forward in the second half of 2023, we expect strong double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, distribution per unit growth expectation range of 12% to 15% for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contribution from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to remain comfortable with these growth expectations. And in fact even at the current trade yield, Energy Resources portfolio alone is just one way NextEra Energy Partners believes it can meet its growth expectations through 2026. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2023 distribution growth of 12% to 15%. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering on their long-term growth prospects. At FPL that means executing on smart capital investments to deliver on its customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. At Energy Resources that means leading the decarbonization of both the power sector and non-power sector and leveraging its competitive advantages to capitalize on low-cost renewals and new emerging technologies like green hydrogen. In NextEra Eneregy Partners, we expect to capitalize on its unmatched growth visibility to further expand its best-in-class clean energy portfolio to provide long-term distribution growth for unit holders. With that, we are happy to address your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fleishman: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. So first a couple of questions on the NEP drop. So just -- should -- I think you're looking at the CAFD yield is the midpoint of the CAFD range over the $708 million, which I guess would be about 9.5%. If you were to over time exclude the project debt and exclude the project debt from the base and exclude the payments of the project debt how does that compare to the 9.5% yield?\nKirk Crews: Yeah. So good morning, Steve. Thank you for the question. So you're right the math you're doing is correct. So you're taking the -- on an unlevered basis, it is 9.5% CAFD yield. So the -- at the midpoint of the CAFD that we provided is a 9.5% CAFD yield. And the reason for that Steve is because the debt that is included is going to be paid off in about three years. And so we felt like that was the appropriate way to present the CAFD yield. If you included the debt it would actually be a much higher CAFD yield. It would be 10.4% CAFD yields. And so -- but as you're probably aware, we've typically provided that figure as an unlevered number.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then the amount of tax equity just to kind of round this out. \nKirk Crews: Sure. Sure. Yeah the amount of tax equity is $165 million and that will be disclosed in the 10-Q that we'll be filing either later today or tomorrow. \nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And Kirk, I think you said something about the growth through 2026 could just come from the I don't know if that was from the NEP portfolio or I guess maybe from the near portfolio. Could you just clarify what you said there? \nKirk Crews: Sure. Yeah. Yeah happy to do that Steve. So look as I shared in our prepared remarks we have Energy partners the growth visibility that NextEra Energy Partners has is never been better. And when you think about the visibility that has been enhanced really with the passage of the IRA and just take through the three steps that we go through the three ways that NextEra Energy Partners can grow and Energy Resources and you look at the existing portfolio that exists today at Energy Resources and then you combine that with the current backlog which today is 20.4 gigawatts and then you combine that with the development expectations as we disclosed that's 58 gigawatts. And then you also consider the organic growth opportunities that NextEra Energy Partners has. And the passage of the IRA has really unlocked optionality that exists in the portfolio at NextEra Energy Partners. And so we now have tremendous opportunity to grow organically through re-powerings. And as we said we're pursuing 1.3 gigawatts of repowerings now. And we also have the ability to look at co-locating storage within the footprint as well. And then obviously as you see there's just a tremendous number of renewable portfolios coming to the market. And NextEra Energy Partners has had a history of being able to execute on those opportunities those third-party opportunities because of many of the advantages that we have in terms of being able to operate and cost of capital advantages. So NextEra Energy Partners has tremendous growth visibilities. But with respect to your question the statement we made is when you're looking -- when we look at the ability to achieve the 12% to 15% LP distribution growth we believe we can achieve that just looking at Energy Resources portfolio alone. And that space at the current trading yield as well and includes our current financing plan that assumes the buyout of all the convertible equity portfolio financing as well. \nSteve Fleishman: Okay. That's helpful. I'm sure others will have questions on that topic. But one other thing I guess just on the overall renewable development environment. Maybe Rebecca you could just talk to what the -- we've now seen I think some stabilization and a lot of the pressures last year, but we've also seen lower gas prices. Just when you look at the overall environment, could you give us some kind of color on what you're seeing and conviction on hitting the development targets that you have out there or maybe hopefully better? Thanks.\nRebecca Kujawa : Steve, good morning. So we continue to see a very strong renewables development environment. And I think the 2 gigawatts that we added to the backlog is a great sign of that, and it's a mix of wind solar and battery storage in that portfolio and the conversations that we continue to have both with customers in the power sector as well as customers outside of the power sector remain quite robust. And if anything I'm concerned about whether or not we have -- we and everybody else have enough renewables in order to support the demand in short. And of course longer-term, we are planning accordingly to make sure that we have all the projects available for our customers. I'd say if there is one thing that I've seen change over the last year in our discussions with our customers, it's really an increased emphasis on partners that have the ability to execute. It's not lost on anybody inside the power sector or outside the power sector that the demand for renewables is really strong and there are challenges to building projects successfully and ultimately operating them long-term for the benefit of customers. And our conversations with customers now reflect that I think appropriately. And we've had some terrific engagements with customers across the board about making sure that we are building what they need for the long-term and their needs are quite significant. The other thing I would highlight that's been very significant development over the last year and really in the last nine months since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is really around hydrogen. And I know we've talked about it lot. And today we wanted to give you some additional color on what we're seeing. And I think that $20 billion of pipeline projects with partners and customers that we're now working on. And honestly that's growing by day and requires just for that $20 billion worth of projects over 15 gigawatts of new renewables to be built to support them. This is unlike any time that we've seen in our industry and of course in our customer -- in our company's history of being able to have significant visibility to tremendous growth and tremendous innovation across the board. We couldn't be more excited about with that.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Thank you.\nRebecca Kujawa : Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Hi. Good morning, team. Thank you for the time here. Just first following up with the backlog. Just can you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing here? It seems like you're adding beyond 2026. How are you thinking about potential for acceleration here off of the numbers that you've articulated thus far in the four-year period? And then related how much of that is hydrogen in total if you can kind of give us at least some initial disclosure on that front. \nRebecca Kujawa : Thanks Julien. It's Rebecca. I'll take that. So we continue to feel and I didn't directly answer Steve's question, so I appreciate you giving me another shot at it. I feel very good about our development expectations across the board. Obviously, we're now -- we're at the low end of the range for 2023 and 2024 and continue to feel very well positioned to meet the longer-term expectations across the four-year period. And with the comments I just made and Kirk made on the call, we couldn't be more excited about what's beyond the 2026 time frame. I do think the hydrogen opportunity is probably more -- not probably, it is definitively more past 2026 than in 2026 for a lot of practical reasons, not the least of which is needing clarity on the treasury guidance, which of course affects the customer discussions that we're having today. It also affects the way manufacturers are committing to their ramp-up of their capabilities to produce electrolyzers in particular. And, of course, as that clarity comes to fruition and hopefully in particular we realize the annual matching guidance for the hydrogen production tax credit all of that will start to accelerate. And then on top of that, we continue to see tremendous innovation across the clean tech space. Just over the last two years I was looking at the numbers from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and its $100 billion invested in clean tech across the venture capital space. So just tremendously exciting innovations that we're seeing and I think will really make a huge difference in the latter part of this decade.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And just quickly going back to NEP quickly. How do you think about using ATM to buy out the remaining CPIF [ph] they come due? Further should we assume issuing new CPIF on a rolling basis as credit facilities are refinanced right again obviously right now this is temporary financing in some respects. And then ultimately how do you think about the IDR potential holidays and other tools in the current environment?\nKirk Crews: All right. So Julien I'll try to work off all those questions and the team will make sure I get to them all. So the first question was around the use of the ATM. So look as we shared in the prepared remarks, we have the flexibility to be opportunistic to use -- to deliver to the investor either directly units or to use the ATM on the buyouts. And so you should expect us to use that flexibility and to be opportunistic around those options. And so if we go to the ATM, there's some value to go into the ATM at times to deliver. And there's also -- there will be times where it's just beneficial to deliver the units. So we have both those tools and we can use them. In terms of using unit CPIF in the future. As we share today the CPIF have provided benefits for unitholders. And when you compare it to the alternative, which is doing an underwritten block equity deal when you compare those two as we presented on the slide, it has saved unitholders considerably more than 16 million units. And when you compare those two, I think that slide is -- does a really nice job laying out the benefits. And so as we've always done, we will look at what's the best financing option when it's time to finance an acquisition. And we look at all the different financing tools that we have. And as we shared today when we build our financing plan and when we think about delivering on our LP distribution growth, we build a financing plan into those financing expectations and that includes the conversion of the outstanding units. And certainly, if we're going to use a new CEPF, we will build that into the financing plan and what that means in terms of being able to continue to deliver on the expectations. And I believe your third question was around what are the other -- is there going to be something around an IDR holiday or something like that. Look, as I shared in responding to Steve's comment, we have tremendous growth opportunities and in tremendous growth visibility at NextEra Energy Partners. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to finance that growth. The acquisition that we announced today I think is a really strong indication of how we can acquire a very attractive set of assets for unitholders. And so we feel very good about being able to acquire assets and support growth. And so we're focused on being able to tap into that growth visibility and deliver to unitholders that way.\nJohn Ketchum: Julien this is John. Let me just add on a little bit about the ATM and the ability to issue shares directly to CEPF investors. Our first preference I think would be to issue shares directly to CEPF investors. This was a situation where we were able to use the ATM for the first 50% of the STX buyout very opportunistically and we could do it basically at a zero discount and it made a lot of sense to be able to do it that way. It's great to have the flexibility when you have opportunities like that that are presented by the ATM to be able to execute on them. So it's a nice tool to have in the toolkit. But again, we have ultimate flexibility in terms of -- if opportunities present themselves that are very attractive under the ATM, we can explore those opportunities. But again, we always have the chance to just give the shares directly to the CEPF holder. We're always going to do whatever is most efficient for unitholders. We had a slide in the deck today that I think demonstrates the value of the CEPF, the 54% savings on the BlackRock conversion back in 2018, roughly the 65% 66% savings in the 50% STX buyout that we've accomplished so far today. But at NEP, right now we are very focused on execution for the things that Kirk has already gone through. We've got great growth visibility, attractive acquisition today at a 9.5% CAFD yield. And we have a lot of ways to finance the business going forward. There's never been more capital chasing renewables than there is today. There are billions and billions and billions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, waiting to find a home around renewable assets. So I feel very good about the way NEP is positioned. NEP is also very important to NEE. It's a great way to recycle capital that provides tax optimization benefits. We continue to get distributions from assets that we drop into NEP. So the relationship between the two companies is very strong and has been very successful for both. We've got a lot of levers, NEP is very well positioned.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just real quick on rounding out on NEP. So I guess the latest portfolio acquisition, the midpoint CAFD yield, 9.5%. It's a bit higher than some of the prior ones. I guess, do you still see attractive economics on new acquisitions? Is it enough to balance out the dilution from the legacy CEPF conversions. So I guess I'm kind of asking a question on accretive economics versus the cost of capital there? \nRebecca Kujawa: Shar, I think the answer very simply is, yes. We think there are tremendously attractive acquisitions for NEP. And as John just highlighted, Energy Resources finds itself in a position of wanting to recycle capital. So there's a lot of synergy in that. And I think we will always continue to focus on current market conditions when we're thinking about divestitures from a year perspective and acquisitions from a net perspective. And as Kirk highlighted and John emphasized, we factor all of that in as we think about the expectations for NEP going forward and remain very comfortable with NEP's ability to grow the 12% to 15% distributions per unit through 2026 as we reiterated. And having a tremendous amount of both financing flexibility and visibility to that growth through all the avenues that Kirk highlighted.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just on NextEra in general in terms of sort of the inputs we've seen, you guys have announced several earnings accretive data points since last year, right? You've got RNG acquisition hydrogen, organic transmission growth and some incremental visibility on FPL solar deployment. Do any of these investments kind of displace the CapEx, you guys embedded in plan at the Analyst Day? Is there any sort of headwinds we should be thinking about? And ultimately, do you anticipate this to start being accretive to your plan from let's say 2025 to 2026 time frame especially, as we're thinking about the six to eight.\nKirk Crews: So Shar, this is Kirk. Look, we are always \u2013 as you know capital is fungible. We're always looking at what all kinds of investment opportunities we have. We lay out \u2013 when we laid out the plan at the investor conference, that was certainly pre-IRA. The world has changed a little bit as a result of that. But fundamentally, we feel very good about executing and delivering on the adjusted EPS expectations that we laid out. We obviously are before \u2013 at the time of the Investor Day, hydrogen wasn't an economic product. Green hydrogen was not an economic product. It is today because of the IRA and so we're running hard at it. But as Rebecca also outlined, the reality is that is probably a post-2026 realization in terms of what \u2013 how it's going to translate into benefits. So there's a lot that we're running after and a lot we're looking at. But most of this is things that we were evaluating and thinking about at the time of the investor conference or things that are going to really come to fruition post-2026 and really either part of the plans post plans but all things that are supporting ultimately the things that we laid out and feel comfortable about in terms of delivering adjusted EPS for 2026. \nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nKirk Crews: Hi, good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base a little bit more on supply chain if you could. If you might be able to provide a bit more commentary on how flow panels stand today versus a few years back and also as well as bringing the supply chain onshore. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on how what time line you see that finalizing?\nKirk Crews: Sure. So, as we shared in our prepared remarks I mean we've spent a lot of time thinking about supply chain working with suppliers. It has been a very comprehensive effort. It's been looking both globally and then obviously here domestically as well. Look there's lots of things to think through domestically. We're continuing to work through that as well. It is about trying to evaluate where in the supply chain there might be opportunities in terms of how to participate. But the way to think about that Jeremy is our view has always been we could be supportive through an anchor order, we could help provide support through that mechanism. That continues to be our preferred approach. And we're working with various potential partners in discussions that way and that's continued those discussions continue to occur.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And just flow panels today, just wondering how that stacks up versus where it was a few years ago?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. This is John. So, the flow of panels is going very well. As Kirk said we've been active with Customs Border Patrol and panels are now flowing through the ports, really don\u2019t see any material delays to any of our projects, so we feel good about that. And as Kirk said I mean we're in active -- the great thing about a company like NextEra with the capital spend that we have and the sophistication that we have around running a global supply chain, we have a lot of options -- a lot of options, a diversified set of options globally and we're exercising those options and we're exploring new opportunities as well. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in working directly with NextEra given the amount of buying power that we have. We will always be the preferred customer for each of these -- just given the scale at which we purchase and that allows us to drive attractive arrangements, which we think will really help make the business even more competitive going forward. And so, we have launched a number of those efforts, both domestically and looking at some other diversification opportunities globally that will even better position the business, than it's ever been before, going forward to really capitalize on the competitive advantage we have in terms of the buying power around the supply chain.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. All my other questions have been asked and answered. Just quickly, I wanted to follow up on the 10-year pipeline. Maybe, can you just remind us, what are sort of the key milestones for us to watch from here on from a regulatory standpoint for you to get approvals et cetera, et cetera? And then, just second, would this be the spending here you mentioned post-2025. Would some of this spending investment be accretive to the current plan you have through 2026? Thank you.\nArmando Pimentel: So, it's Armando. The way to think about it is for the rest of the time under the settlement agreement that we have at FPL, so through the end of 2025, what you see in the 10-year site plan is what we have in our plan, right? There's no additional amounts that will be added to that CapEx. So it's really about '26 moving forward. In terms of approval at the Public Service Commission, you'll see that, as we provide the information for our next rate case, most of that -- well, all of that -- all of the big generation in there is solar and there's also some storage in there. So, there's no additional CapEx through 2025 and most of that, you will see when we update our expectations at some point beyond '26. \nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So the approval -- Armando, thank you for that, I appreciate it. The approval of this plan comes through to the rate case process?\nArmando Pimentel: While the approval comes through either the rate case process, because we've got CapEx that we've invested just as general infrastructure or it will come through one of the two solar programs that we have today. So our Sombra solar program and also our SolarTogether solar program. The Sombra and SolarTogether solar program as long as we stick within the guidelines that we reached in the last settlement, those will get approved on an annual basis.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks, so much. Much appreciated. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristen, and good morning everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a strong start in 2023. Adjusted earnings per share increased by approximately 13.5% year-over-year building on the success of last year's strong execution and financial performance. During the quarter, we were honored that NextEra Energy was again ranked number one in our sector on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies for the 16th time in 17 years. We are extremely proud of the team and culture we have built that has enabled us to deliver low-cost clean and reliable power to our customers, while also providing long-term value to our shareholders. FPL is the largest electric utility in the US and Florida is now officially the fastest-growing state in America. At FPL, our focus remains the same deploying smart capital to deliver on what we believe is one of the best customer value propositions in our industry. Key to that strategy is keeping customer bills affordable. And this quarter, we proposed using projected 2023 fuel savings to reduce unbilled fuel costs from 2022 to provide bill relief to customers. To further manage fuel price volatility, we are also helping customers by adding more solar to the FPL grid. This quarter, we placed into service approximately 970 megawatts of new low-cost solar. Putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at nearly 4,600 megawatts, which is the largest solar portfolio of any utility in the country. We believe solar is now the lowest cost generation option for Florida customers, but represents only about 5% of FPL's delivered energy. In order to extend the benefits of low-cost solar to customers, FPL's recently filed 10-year site plan, now includes nearly 20,000 megawatts of new solar. Energy Resources, the world's leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, remains laser-focused on executing a strategy of decarbonizing the power sector and helping commercial and industrial customers outside the power sector, reduce their energy cost and decarbonize their operations by moving to low-cost renewables and other clean energy solutions. This quarter, Energy Resources added approximately 2,020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. Energy Resources also closed on its previously announced acquisition of a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities, providing the foundation for our growing RNG business. We are also excited to announce a new memorandum of understanding with CF Industries to create green hydrogen, establishing what we expect will be a long-term relationship with the world's largest ammonium producer. And finally, Energy Resources continues to build what we believe is the nation's leading competitive transmission business to help support growth in renewables. We are pleased to announce that the California ISO recently recommended for approval approximately $400 million in new transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission. We believe, NextEra Energy continues to be anchored by two great businesses that leverage each other's expertise to make them even better. We do not believe anyone in our industry has our set of skills, scale and breadth of opportunities. We believe NextEra Energy is able to buy, build operate and finance cheaper with one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. We also believe our best-in-class development skills and unparalleled data set enable us to provide innovative technology and low-cost clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. The opportunities and products demanded by the market are becoming more complex, requiring significant scale and a combination of skills that we believe few of our competitors can offer, further enhancing our competitive advantages and creating even more growth opportunities for our business going forward. We have a culture rooted and continuous improvement, always striving to be better. Along those lines, we just completed our annual employee-led productivity initiative, which we now call Velocity. For over 11 years, our employees have generated approximately $2.6 billion in annual run rate savings ideas, as part of this process. In 2023 alone, our team generated ideas expected to produce roughly $325 million in annual run rate savings, which when combined with last year's results of over $400 million is the most productive two-year period in this program's history and that's after doing it for over a decade. We believe we have the best team in the industry, and these results are indicative of the breadth and depth of capabilities and the commitment to excellence that our team brings to our business every day and executing on behalf of our customers and shareholders. With that let's turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the first quarter of 2023, FPL reported net income of $1.07 billion, or $0.53 per share an increase of $0.09 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.2% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter. We expect our full year 2023 capital investments at FPL to be between $8.0 billion and $9.0 billion, as we continue to invest capital smartly for the continued benefit of our customers. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% for the 12 months ending March 2023. During the quarter, we utilized $373 million of reserve amortization to achieve our targeted regulatory ROE leaving FPL with a balance of $1.07 billion. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's proposed plan to recover approximately $2.1 billion of incremental fuel costs from 2022 partially offset by projected 2023 fuel savings of approximately $1.4 billion. Amid high natural gas prices in 2022, FPL's decades-long modernization of its generation fleet has saved customers more than $2 billion in fuel costs in 2022 alone. The commission also recently approved recovery of approximately $1.3 billion of hurricane costs from 2022 over a 12-month period. Taking all approved adjustments together, we anticipate that FPL's typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bills will remain well below the projected national average and among the lowest of all Florida utilities. Turning to our development planning and efforts. FPL recently filed its annual 10-year site plan that presents our generation resource plan for the next decade. The 2023 plan includes roughly 20,000 megawatts of new low-cost solar capacity across our service territory over the next 10 years, which would result in nearly 35% of FPL's forecasted energy delivery in 2032 coming from cost-effective solar generation up significantly from roughly 5% in 2022. Given the increasing customer benefits of low-cost renewables FPL's post-2025 solar capacity additions and this year's plan are more than double last year's approved plan and also includes 2 gigawatts of battery storage over the next decade. We believe the expansion of cost-effective solar and storage will provide a valuable hedge for our customers against volatile natural gas prices and meet the electricity demand of FPL's growing customer base with a low-cost generation source. Finally, construction of our green hydrogen pilot at our Okeechobee Clean Energy Center is on track and projected to go into service later this year. Turning now to the Florida economy. Florida became the fastest-growing state in the nation in 2022 and its population continues to increase with over 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. Over the last five years, Florida's GDP has grown at a roughly 7% compound annual growth rate and is now approximately $1.4 trillion which is up approximately 8% versus a year ago. Based on GDP, if Florida was a country, it would have the 14th largest economy in the world. FPL's first quarter retail sales increased 0.4% from the prior year comparable period driven by continued solid underlying population growth with FPL's average number of customers increasing by approximately 65,000, even after removing roughly 15,000 inactive customers due to Hurricane Ian. For the first quarter, we estimate that the positive impact of warmer weather was more than offset by a decline in underlying usage for our customers. As we have often pointed out, underlying usage can be somewhat volatile on a quarterly basis, particularly during periods when temperatures deviate significantly from normal, as we experienced this winter with average temperatures greater than four degrees above normal. Our long-term expectations of underlying usage growth continues to average between zero and approximately negative 0.5% per year. Energy Resources report first quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of approximately $1.440 billion or $0.72 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $732 million or $0.36 per share up $0.04 versus the prior year comparable period. Contributions from new investments increased $0.07 per share year-over-year. Contributions from our existing Clean Energy portfolio were lower by $0.03 per share primarily due to less favorable wind and solar resource compared to the prior year. The contribution from our customer supply and trading business increased by $0.06 per share primarily due to higher margin in our customer-facing business and compared to a relatively weaker contribution in the prior year comparable quarter. Gas infrastructure and all other impacts reduced earnings by $0.01 and $0.05 per share respectively versus 2022. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of origination capitalizing on strong global demand environment. Since the last call, we added approximately 2020 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects to our backlog including roughly 1370 megawatts of solar, 450 megawatts of storage and 200 megawatts of wind. With these additions, our renewables and storage backlog now stands at over 20.4 gigawatts net of projects placed in service and provides strong visibility into our future growth. With more than 1.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we are now within the 2023 to 2024 development expectations range. Given the volatility in gas and power prices over the last 1.5 years, we continue to see economics driving long-term decision-making and renewables remain the clear low-cost option for many customers. On the supply -- solar supply chain front, we continue to take constructive steps to mitigate potential future disruption. Nearly every one of our suppliers has repositioned their supply chains to manufacture solar panels in Southeast Asia using wafers and cells produced outside of China, and all our suppliers are expected to meet the criteria established in the Commerce Department's preliminary determination in the 2022 circumvention case by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are focused on further diversifying our supply chain and are currently advancing discussions to support the domestic production of solar panels. Finally, we are encouraged by the improvement in the flow of panels into the US as suppliers continue to provide the requested traceability documentation to US Customs and Border Protection. Also, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a large portfolio of operating landfill gas-to-electric facilities that I mentioned earlier. The approximately $1.1 billion transaction represents an attractive opportunity for energy resources to realize double-digit returns on this investment, while expanding its portfolio of renewable natural gas assets and growing its in-house capabilities and rapidly expanding renewable fuel market. Turning to green hydrogen, we are excited about the role it is expected to play as a solution to help our customers cost effectively lower emissions. As the world leader in renewables and a leader in battery storage, we believe we are the logical partner for green hydrogen with significant interconnection and land inventory positions and deep market expertise to help our potential partners optimize some of the best green hydrogen sites around the country. As a result, with the right regulation, we see hydrogen quickly becoming a significant technology for our customers and a new growth driver for energy resources given the number and size of the opportunities we are evaluating. Earlier this month, NextEra Energy joined a coalition of 45 other companies with a combined approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization and sending a letter to the Secretaries of Energy & Treasury and the White House advocating for programmatic policies for the implementation of the IRAs green hydrogen production tax credit. This coalition is advocating for prudent policy that will foster investment in green hydrogen technology paving the way for the US to become the world leader in hydrogen technology. A key aspect of this policy is for the electricity consumed for green hydrogen production to be matched to its renewable power generation on an annual rather than an hourly basis. We believe that an annual matching construct has several benefits over hourly including lower green hydrogen prices, more renewables being built, a significant reduction in carbon emissions, and green hydrogen achieving cost parity with gray and blue hydrogen both of which rely on fossil fuels for their production. This viewpoint is supported by numerous third-party studies from respected entities such as Wood Mackenzie, Rhodium Group, Energy Futures Initiative, Energy and Environmental Economics, and MIT Energy Institute. As we continue to work with the industry and government representatives to progress a smart hydrogen policy, we are also advancing our green hydrogen development efforts including a recently executed Memorandum of Understanding for a joint venture with CF Industries, the world's largest producer of ammonia to develop -- to deliver green hydrogen to an existing CF Industries ammonia production facility which it intends to expand and incorporate green hydrogen into its production process. The proposed facility includes an approximately 450-megawatt renewable energy solution, powering a 40 tons per day hydrogen facility. This project combined with other opportunities we are pursuing represent significant momentum for green hydrogen, which we believe will continue to be a driver of new renewables growth going forward. Our team continues to engage with multiple potential partners and customers on hydrogen projects, representing over $20 billion of capital investments and requiring more than 15 gigawatts of new renewables to support. As we focus on leading the decarbonization of the US economy, building additional transmission is essential to support long-term renewables deployment. We believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission as a key competitive advantage for our renewables business, in addition to being a terrific investment opportunity. We are pleased that the California ISO recently recommended for approval of approximately $400 million in transmission and substation upgrades for NextEra Energy Transmission, subject to approval by the CAISO Board of Governors in May. We believe these projects along with others could unlock up to 11 gigawatts of new renewable generation that could be built to support California's ambitious clean energy goals. Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2023 GAAP earnings attributable to NextEra Energy were $2.086 billion or $1.04 per share. NextEra Energy's 2023 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were approximately $1.678 billion and $0.84 per share respectively. Adjusted earnings for the Corporate and Other segment decreased results by $0.03 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by higher interest rates. In March, S&P affirmed all its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operations or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 20% to the current level of 18%. In making this favorable adjustment, S&P acknowledged improvement in Energy Resources business risk following the passage of the IRA, particularly noting the improved visibility and clarity into long-term cash flows. At the same time, S&P adjusted its treatment of non-recourse project debt associated with FERC Regulated investments to bring it back on credit. We believe this overall favorable adjustment, which creates roughly 50 bps of additional headroom against the downgrade threshold, highlights the attractive risk profile of renewables and acknowledges the long-term stable cash flows and Energy Resources business, particularly given the benefits of the IRA. Finally as we have discussed in the past, we actively enter into various interest rate swaps products to manage interest rate exposure on future debt issuance. Today, we have $21 billion of interest rate swaps at NextEra Energy to help mitigate the impact of potential future increases in rates, which exceeds the notional value of our 2023 and 2024 maturities. And as always, the current interest rate environment is taken into account in our financial expectations. Our long-term financial expectations which we extended earlier this year through 2026 remain unchanged. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in each year from 2023 to 2026, while at the same time maintaining our strong balance sheet and credit ratings. From 2021 to 2026, we also continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2024 off a 2022 base. As always, our expectations assume our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. We believe, we have never had more visible growth opportunities than we have today. We have the ability to grow in three ways: acquiring assets from Energy Resources, growing organically and buying assets from other third parties. With significant tailwinds from the IRA, Energy Resources' operating portfolio, combined with its backlog of projects and development expectations through 2026, total approximately 58 gigawatts, providing terrific visibility for NextEra Energy Partners and Energy Resources is continuing to grow in innovative ways, adding new technologies and clean energy assets to its portfolio, such as RNG and hydrogen. In addition to acquiring assets from Energy Resources, NextEra Energy Partners also has the ability to repower its existing assets, with approximately 1,300 megawatts of potential wind repowerings, already identified, and many more opportunities expected to come, as well as potential to locate storage at its existing renewable assets, given the new stand-alone storage ITC. Finally, there are significant acquisition opportunities with renewable portfolios, continuously being brought to market. NextEra Energy Partners also has numerous ways that can finance this growth and we believe, it can do so efficiently, given its ample liquidity and access to capital. At the end of the first quarter, NextEra Energy Partners had $2.8 billion of liquidity and approximately $6 billion of interest rate swaps to manage future interest rate volatility on debt maturities through 2026. With regard to convertible equity portfolio financing, we can fund equity buyouts by delivering common units or utilizing our at-the-market or ATM program or a combination of both and we believe we have ample liquidity to fund cash payments. Importantly, we have flexibility and we expect to leverage this flexibility to manage future buyouts to select the most efficient option. Using this flexibility, NextEra Energy Partners has now bought out 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing through funds generated from a combination of the ATM program, where NextEra Energy Partners was able to be opportunistic and cash from a subsidiary's revolving credit facility. With the buyouts of the 2018 convertible equity portfolio financing and 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing complete, we estimate that the convertible equity portfolio financing structure has resulted in approximately 55% and 64% respectively or 16 million fewer units being issued, compared to raising capital with underwritten block equity, all for the benefit of unitholders. For the balance of the year, files are now expected to be limited to the remaining 50% of the STX Midstream convertible equity [ph] portfolio financing and 15% of the net renewables to convertible equity portfolio financing with the equity portion of these buyouts requiring common units of approximately $280 million and $130 million respectively. Over the next eight months, we have flexibility and time to opportunistically manage these buyouts in the most efficient way. For each buyout, we have the flexibility to deliver common units to the convertible equity portfolio financing investor, utilize the ATM program or some combination of the two. Ultimately, we will select the most efficient option. In any event, the potential unit issuance from these buyouts are not expected to exceed an average of three days of total trading volume per quarter, which we expect will make them quite manageable. Most importantly, NextEra Energy Partners' growth expectations through 2026 already factor in its financing plan, including convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts at current trading yields. Turning to distribution growth. Yesterday the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8425 per common unit or $3.37 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this quarter, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its LP distribution per unit up nearly 350% since the IPO. Today we are pleased to announce that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement with Energy Resources to acquire an approximately 690-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind and solar projects and attractive cash available for distribution yield. The high-quality portfolio has a cash available for distribution, weighted average remaining contract life of approximately 16 years, an average customer credit rating of BBB at S&P and Baa2 at Moody's Investors Service. NextEra Energy Partners is expected to acquire the portfolio for approximately $708 million, subject to closing adjustments and is inclusive of the portfolio's existing project debt and interest rate swaps which are estimated to be approximately $142 million. In addition to the approximately $708 million purchase price, NextEra Energy Partners is also expected to assume the portfolio's existing tax equity financing balance. The remaining purchase price is expected to be funded by a combination of new project finance debt and the corporate revolving credit facility. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million to $130 million and cash available for distribution prior to the existing project debt service of approximately $62 million to $72 million, each on a five-year average annual run rate basis, beginning December 31 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEnergy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. Next Energy Partners will remain opportunistic pursuing acquisitions in 2023. And with the closing of the transaction announced today, NextEnergy Partners expects to be well positioned to meet its year-end 2023 adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution run rate expectations. Turning to the detailed results. NextEra Energy Partners delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution results in line with management's expectations. Adjusted EBITDA of $447 million increased by $35 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by favorable contributions from the approximately 1,200 net megawatts of new projects acquired in 2022. Both adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions were negatively affected by lower resource from existing projects. Additionally, cash available from distribution was lower versus the prior year comparable period due to incremental debt service and timing of payable payments. Looking forward in the second half of 2023, we expect strong double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to support NextEra Energy Partners, distribution per unit growth expectation range of 12% to 15% for the full year 2023. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distributions from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2023, to be in the ranges of $2.22 billion to $2.42 billion and $770 million to $860 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2023 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2024 contribution from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2023 and include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. As always, our expectations are subject to our usual caveats including normal weather and operating conditions. From a base of our fourth quarter 2022 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.25, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to remain comfortable with these growth expectations. And in fact even at the current trade yield, Energy Resources portfolio alone is just one way NextEra Energy Partners believes it can meet its growth expectations through 2026. For 2023, we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2023 distribution that is payable in February 2024 to be in a range of $3.64 to $3.74 per common unit. We also continue to expect to achieve our 2023 distribution growth of 12% to 15%. In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners are well-positioned to continue delivering on their long-term growth prospects. At FPL that means executing on smart capital investments to deliver on its customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. At Energy Resources that means leading the decarbonization of both the power sector and non-power sector and leveraging its competitive advantages to capitalize on low-cost renewals and new emerging technologies like green hydrogen. In NextEra Eneregy Partners, we expect to capitalize on its unmatched growth visibility to further expand its best-in-class clean energy portfolio to provide long-term distribution growth for unit holders. With that, we are happy to address your questions. Yeah. So good morning, Steve. Thank you for the question. So you're right the math you're doing is correct. So you're taking the -- on an unlevered basis, it is 9.5% CAFD yield. So the -- at the midpoint of the CAFD that we provided is a 9.5% CAFD yield. And the reason for that Steve is because the debt that is included is going to be paid off in about three years. And so we felt like that was the appropriate way to present the CAFD yield. If you included the debt it would actually be a much higher CAFD yield. It would be 10.4% CAFD yields. And so -- but as you're probably aware, we've typically provided that figure as an unlevered number. Sure. Sure. Yeah the amount of tax equity is $165 million and that will be disclosed in the 10-Q that we'll be filing either later today or tomorrow. Sure. Yeah. Yeah happy to do that Steve. So look as I shared in our prepared remarks we have Energy partners the growth visibility that NextEra Energy Partners has is never been better. And when you think about the visibility that has been enhanced really with the passage of the IRA and just take through the three steps that we go through the three ways that NextEra Energy Partners can grow and Energy Resources and you look at the existing portfolio that exists today at Energy Resources and then you combine that with the current backlog which today is 20.4 gigawatts and then you combine that with the development expectations as we disclosed that's 58 gigawatts. And then you also consider the organic growth opportunities that NextEra Energy Partners has. And the passage of the IRA has really unlocked optionality that exists in the portfolio at NextEra Energy Partners. And so we now have tremendous opportunity to grow organically through re-powerings. And as we said we're pursuing 1.3 gigawatts of repowerings now. And we also have the ability to look at co-locating storage within the footprint as well. And then obviously as you see there's just a tremendous number of renewable portfolios coming to the market. And NextEra Energy Partners has had a history of being able to execute on those opportunities those third-party opportunities because of many of the advantages that we have in terms of being able to operate and cost of capital advantages. So NextEra Energy Partners has tremendous growth visibilities. But with respect to your question the statement we made is when you're looking -- when we look at the ability to achieve the 12% to 15% LP distribution growth we believe we can achieve that just looking at Energy Resources portfolio alone. And that space at the current trading yield as well and includes our current financing plan that assumes the buyout of all the convertible equity portfolio financing as well. All right. So Julien I'll try to work off all those questions and the team will make sure I get to them all. So the first question was around the use of the ATM. So look as we shared in the prepared remarks, we have the flexibility to be opportunistic to use -- to deliver to the investor either directly units or to use the ATM on the buyouts. And so you should expect us to use that flexibility and to be opportunistic around those options. And so if we go to the ATM, there's some value to go into the ATM at times to deliver. And there's also -- there will be times where it's just beneficial to deliver the units. So we have both those tools and we can use them. In terms of using unit CPIF in the future. As we share today the CPIF have provided benefits for unitholders. And when you compare it to the alternative, which is doing an underwritten block equity deal when you compare those two as we presented on the slide, it has saved unitholders considerably more than 16 million units. And when you compare those two, I think that slide is -- does a really nice job laying out the benefits. And so as we've always done, we will look at what's the best financing option when it's time to finance an acquisition. And we look at all the different financing tools that we have. And as we shared today when we build our financing plan and when we think about delivering on our LP distribution growth, we build a financing plan into those financing expectations and that includes the conversion of the outstanding units. And certainly, if we're going to use a new CEPF, we will build that into the financing plan and what that means in terms of being able to continue to deliver on the expectations. And I believe your third question was around what are the other -- is there going to be something around an IDR holiday or something like that. Look, as I shared in responding to Steve's comment, we have tremendous growth opportunities and in tremendous growth visibility at NextEra Energy Partners. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to finance that growth. The acquisition that we announced today I think is a really strong indication of how we can acquire a very attractive set of assets for unitholders. And so we feel very good about being able to acquire assets and support growth. And so we're focused on being able to tap into that growth visibility and deliver to unitholders that way. So Shar, this is Kirk. Look, we are always \u2013 as you know capital is fungible. We're always looking at what all kinds of investment opportunities we have. We lay out \u2013 when we laid out the plan at the investor conference, that was certainly pre-IRA. The world has changed a little bit as a result of that. But fundamentally, we feel very good about executing and delivering on the adjusted EPS expectations that we laid out. We obviously are before \u2013 at the time of the Investor Day, hydrogen wasn't an economic product. Green hydrogen was not an economic product. It is today because of the IRA and so we're running hard at it. But as Rebecca also outlined, the reality is that is probably a post-2026 realization in terms of what \u2013 how it's going to translate into benefits. So there's a lot that we're running after and a lot we're looking at. But most of this is things that we were evaluating and thinking about at the time of the investor conference or things that are going to really come to fruition post-2026 and really either part of the plans post plans but all things that are supporting ultimately the things that we laid out and feel comfortable about in terms of delivering adjusted EPS for 2026. Hi, good morning. Sure. So, as we shared in our prepared remarks I mean we've spent a lot of time thinking about supply chain working with suppliers. It has been a very comprehensive effort. It's been looking both globally and then obviously here domestically as well. Look there's lots of things to think through domestically. We're continuing to work through that as well. It is about trying to evaluate where in the supply chain there might be opportunities in terms of how to participate. But the way to think about that Jeremy is our view has always been we could be supportive through an anchor order, we could help provide support through that mechanism. That continues to be our preferred approach. And we're working with various potential partners in discussions that way and that's continued those discussions continue to occur."

            "name": "Armando Pimentel",
            "content": "So, it's Armando. The way to think about it is for the rest of the time under the settlement agreement that we have at FPL, so through the end of 2025, what you see in the 10-year site plan is what we have in our plan, right? There's no additional amounts that will be added to that CapEx. So it's really about '26 moving forward. In terms of approval at the Public Service Commission, you'll see that, as we provide the information for our next rate case, most of that -- well, all of that -- all of the big generation in there is solar and there's also some storage in there. So, there's no additional CapEx through 2025 and most of that, you will see when we update our expectations at some point beyond '26. While the approval comes through either the rate case process, because we've got CapEx that we've invested just as general infrastructure or it will come through one of the two solar programs that we have today. So our Sombra solar program and also our SolarTogether solar program. The Sombra and SolarTogether solar program as long as we stick within the guidelines that we reached in the last settlement, those will get approved on an annual basis."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Julien this is John. Let me just add on a little bit about the ATM and the ability to issue shares directly to CEPF investors. Our first preference I think would be to issue shares directly to CEPF investors. This was a situation where we were able to use the ATM for the first 50% of the STX buyout very opportunistically and we could do it basically at a zero discount and it made a lot of sense to be able to do it that way. It's great to have the flexibility when you have opportunities like that that are presented by the ATM to be able to execute on them. So it's a nice tool to have in the toolkit. But again, we have ultimate flexibility in terms of -- if opportunities present themselves that are very attractive under the ATM, we can explore those opportunities. But again, we always have the chance to just give the shares directly to the CEPF holder. We're always going to do whatever is most efficient for unitholders. We had a slide in the deck today that I think demonstrates the value of the CEPF, the 54% savings on the BlackRock conversion back in 2018, roughly the 65% 66% savings in the 50% STX buyout that we've accomplished so far today. But at NEP, right now we are very focused on execution for the things that Kirk has already gone through. We've got great growth visibility, attractive acquisition today at a 9.5% CAFD yield. And we have a lot of ways to finance the business going forward. There's never been more capital chasing renewables than there is today. There are billions and billions and billions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, waiting to find a home around renewable assets. So I feel very good about the way NEP is positioned. NEP is also very important to NEE. It's a great way to recycle capital that provides tax optimization benefits. We continue to get distributions from assets that we drop into NEP. So the relationship between the two companies is very strong and has been very successful for both. We've got a lot of levers, NEP is very well positioned. Yes. This is John. So, the flow of panels is going very well. As Kirk said we've been active with Customs Border Patrol and panels are now flowing through the ports, really don't see any material delays to any of our projects, so we feel good about that. And as Kirk said I mean we're in active -- the great thing about a company like NextEra with the capital spend that we have and the sophistication that we have around running a global supply chain, we have a lot of options -- a lot of options, a diversified set of options globally and we're exercising those options and we're exploring new opportunities as well. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in working directly with NextEra given the amount of buying power that we have. We will always be the preferred customer for each of these -- just given the scale at which we purchase and that allows us to drive attractive arrangements, which we think will really help make the business even more competitive going forward. And so, we have launched a number of those efforts, both domestically and looking at some other diversification opportunities globally that will even better position the business, than it's ever been before, going forward to really capitalize on the competitive advantage we have in terms of the buying power around the supply chain."

            "content": "Steve, good morning. So we continue to see a very strong renewables development environment. And I think the 2 gigawatts that we added to the backlog is a great sign of that, and it's a mix of wind solar and battery storage in that portfolio and the conversations that we continue to have both with customers in the power sector as well as customers outside of the power sector remain quite robust. And if anything I'm concerned about whether or not we have -- we and everybody else have enough renewables in order to support the demand in short. And of course longer-term, we are planning accordingly to make sure that we have all the projects available for our customers. I'd say if there is one thing that I've seen change over the last year in our discussions with our customers, it's really an increased emphasis on partners that have the ability to execute. It's not lost on anybody inside the power sector or outside the power sector that the demand for renewables is really strong and there are challenges to building projects successfully and ultimately operating them long-term for the benefit of customers. And our conversations with customers now reflect that I think appropriately. And we've had some terrific engagements with customers across the board about making sure that we are building what they need for the long-term and their needs are quite significant. The other thing I would highlight that's been very significant development over the last year and really in the last nine months since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is really around hydrogen. And I know we've talked about it lot. And today we wanted to give you some additional color on what we're seeing. And I think that $20 billion of pipeline projects with partners and customers that we're now working on. And honestly that's growing by day and requires just for that $20 billion worth of projects over 15 gigawatts of new renewables to be built to support them. This is unlike any time that we've seen in our industry and of course in our customer -- in our company's history of being able to have significant visibility to tremendous growth and tremendous innovation across the board. We couldn't be more excited about with that. Thanks, Steve. Thanks Julien. It's Rebecca. I'll take that. So we continue to feel and I didn't directly answer Steve's question, so I appreciate you giving me another shot at it. I feel very good about our development expectations across the board. Obviously, we're now -- we're at the low end of the range for 2023 and 2024 and continue to feel very well positioned to meet the longer-term expectations across the four-year period. And with the comments I just made and Kirk made on the call, we couldn't be more excited about what's beyond the 2026 time frame. I do think the hydrogen opportunity is probably more -- not probably, it is definitively more past 2026 than in 2026 for a lot of practical reasons, not the least of which is needing clarity on the treasury guidance, which of course affects the customer discussions that we're having today. It also affects the way manufacturers are committing to their ramp-up of their capabilities to produce electrolyzers in particular. And, of course, as that clarity comes to fruition and hopefully in particular we realize the annual matching guidance for the hydrogen production tax credit all of that will start to accelerate. And then on top of that, we continue to see tremendous innovation across the clean tech space. Just over the last two years I was looking at the numbers from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and its $100 billion invested in clean tech across the venture capital space. So just tremendously exciting innovations that we're seeing and I think will really make a huge difference in the latter part of this decade. Shar, I think the answer very simply is, yes. We think there are tremendously attractive acquisitions for NEP. And as John just highlighted, Energy Resources finds itself in a position of wanting to recycle capital. So there's a lot of synergy in that. And I think we will always continue to focus on current market conditions when we're thinking about divestitures from a year perspective and acquisitions from a net perspective. And as Kirk highlighted and John emphasized, we factor all of that in as we think about the expectations for NEP going forward and remain very comfortable with NEP's ability to grow the 12% to 15% distributions per unit through 2026 as we reiterated. And having a tremendous amount of both financing flexibility and visibility to that growth through all the avenues that Kirk highlighted."

NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and remains well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased approximately 10% year-over-year, reflecting continued solid financial and operating -- operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. As a sign of the robust underlying demand for new renewables generation and storage, we are pleased to announce that for the second quarter in a row, we have added approximately 3 gigawatts to our backlog, bringing our running four quarter total to approximately 11 gigawatts. We are also pleased to announce incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts between now and 2030, none of which is in our backlog today. When combined with our Entergy joint development agreement from last quarter, our recent announced framework agreements now totaled up to a potential 15 gigawatts, demonstrating our unique position in the market and our customers' confidence in our ability to help meet the nation's need for power. Before I turn it over to Brian to take you through the detailed results, I want to spend a moment on FPL and Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I then will discuss our view of the industry at this transformative time. I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by these two hurricanes over the last month. Hurricane Helene was one of the most destructive hurricanes to ever make landfall in the continental United States. The powerful and destructive storm hit Florida as a high end Category 4 hurricane, with devastating storm surges and sustained winds of approximately 140 miles per hour, causing approximately 680,000 FPL customers to lose power. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a high end Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of approximately 120 miles per hour, producing numerous tornadoes, widespread flooding, and causing approximately 2 million FPL customers to lose power. Hurricane Milton made landfall on the West Coast of Florida in FPL service territory in Sarasota County and exited on the East Coast of Florida in FPL service territory in Brevard County. In preparation for the hurricanes, FPL assembled a combined restoration workforce of more than 30,000 workers across these two storms. This preparation and coordinated response enabled FPL to restore service to roughly 95 affected customers after the second full day of restoration following Hurricane Helene's landfall and 95% of affected customers after the fourth full day of restoration following Hurricane Milton's landfall. I would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation, their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. Finally, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Governor DeSantis for his unwavering leadership and support during these devastating hurricanes. We're also deeply grateful for the resources provided by our industry partners, who came from 41 different states in Canada to help support our customers during Hurricane Helene and Milton. Mutual aid in times of disaster was one of the hallmarks of our industry and we were proud to be able to assist other utilities to help rebuild some of the damaged southeastern power grid that saw significant impacts from Hurricane Helene in Georgia and the Carolinas. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient grid. The performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening, undergrounding, automation and smart grid investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. During sustained winds of approximately 140 miles per hour during Hurricane Helene and 120 miles per hour during Hurricane Milton, our smart grid technology investments avoided 185,000 outages during Hurricane Helene and avoided 554,000 outages during Hurricane Milton. Additionally, initial performance data shows that FPL's underground distribution power lines perform more than 6x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Florida. We are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained no significant damage. Despite 66 of FPL's 88 existing solar sites or approximately 16 million panels being exposed to storm conditions during Hurricanes Helene and Milton, less than 0.05% of our solar panels were affected. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. The recent storms underscore the importance of a reliable and resilient power grid and this need will only intensify, as we face a period of unprecedented growth in power demand. Over the last 80 years, our sector has experienced many demand cycles from growth emerging out of the World War 2 and the Industrial Revolution to multiple decades of essentially little to flat demand. That's all changed. Today, there are forecasts for an approximate 6x increase in power demand growth in the next 20 years versus the prior 20. That significant projected shift in fundamental demand is across industries, driven in large part by 7/24 loads from data centers, reshoring to manufacturing and electrification of industry, including oil and gas and chemicals to name a few. U.S. data center power demand alone is expected to increase substantially, adding approximately 460 terawatt hours of new electricity demand at a compound annual growth rate of 22% from 2023 to 2030, which could potentially enable 150 gigawatts of new renewables and storage demand over the same period. With all of that demand -- with all of that power demand, it's important to consider what it will take to meet that demand, what type of generation will be required over the next decade or so, and importantly, when can it practically be brought to market? If that demand is not met in a smart prudent way, power prices could escalate over time and affordability could become an increasing concern, driving inflation and making U.S. industry uncompetitive on a global scale. Fortunately, at FPL, we have a playbook in place. We have been addressing the benefits and challenges of fundamental growth for years now, while continuing to deliver on our strong customer value proposition, which is anchored in bills that are nearly 40% below the national average and maintaining top decile reliability. We are making smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage, which are continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost and when combined with generation modernizations, have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001. We are delivering best-in-class non-fuel O&M, where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. Our experience at FPL puts Energy Resources in a unique position to help our customers meet their power demands. We know what it is going to take to successfully meet the challenge that is in front of our industry. We need low cost reliable energy that can also deliver the capacity needed to support grid and we need it now. Cost, capacity and speed are the three big issues that need to be addressed in meeting power demand. And as we have demonstrated in Florida, a mix of new renewable storage and gas generation is the solution. When it comes to economics, renewables and storage are the lowest cost generation and capacity resource for customers in many parts of the U.S. We believe new wind is up to 60% cheaper and new solar up to 40% cheaper than new gas power generation, and that's on a nearly firm basis when paired with a 4 hour battery. Incentives for wind, solar, and storage flow directly to customers in the form of lower bills. Over the past several years, we have seen the customer benefits of low cost solar and storage at FPL, where the two combined resources are currently the lowest cost option for customers, beating out new build gas and combined cycle units in our 10 year site plan. As a result, FPL now has the largest utility owned solar portfolio in the country. What FPL is seeing in Florida is also playing out across the rest of the country, whether with investor owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives or commercial and industrial customers. And when it comes to speed to market, no technology is quicker to deploy than renewables and storage. Wind, solar and storage not only can be built quicker, but they're already in the interconnection queue. But don't just take our word for it, look at our backlog. We've added another approximately 3 gigawatts of renewables and storage this quarter, our second quarter in a row. As a top operator of all forms of power generation, we often get asked about nuclear and gas. Let me start with nuclear. Nuclear will play a role, but there are some practical limitations. Remember, on a national level, we expect we are going to need to add 900 gigawatts of new generation to the grid by 2040. There are only a few nuclear plants that can be recommissioned in an economic way. We are currently evaluating the recommissioning of our Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa as one example. But even with a 100% success rate on those recommissionings, we would still only meet less than 1% of that demand. Existing merchant nuclear generation is also limited in its ability to meet that demand, given there are only approximately 20 merchant nuclear plants in this country. That nuclear capacity is also not evenly spread across the U.S. And is not in many places. We know hyperscalers are looking to develop data centers or manufacturing -- manufacturers are looking to expand their footprint. For example, there are only two merchant nuclear plants west of the Mississippi. Nuclear plants across the country are already serving existing demand. So even if they are contracted by specific customers, new resources need to be built to meet new demand. And alternatives such as new utility scale nuclear and SMRs are unproven, expensive and again, not expected to be commercially viable at scale until the latter part of the next decade. Turning to gas, when it comes to gas power generation, nobody has built more over the last two decades in NextEra Energy. We understand the benefits and the challenges and we know what it all costs and how long it takes to build. The power sector is going to need to build more gas power generation and battery storage to meet growing capacity needs over the next decade. And as we build more, we also enable more renewables to come to market as the lowest cost generation source of energy. Renewables will be built for energy and battery storage and gas for capacity. That being said, while we are going to need both, storage has an advantage because it's ready now as it can be paired with renewables at the same interconnect and there are no wait times or permitting hurdles for batteries. And renewables and storage will only get cheaper and cheaper over time, and we believe will continue to make up the lion's share of new additions over the long haul. To summarize, we believe power demand is at an inflection point and we expect much of that demand to be met by renewables and storage because they're low cost, fast to deploy and in the transmission queue now. And the potential opportunity is significant. Forecasts are projecting a tripling in renewables growth over the next seven years compared to what we've seen over the prior seven. No one is better positioned to capitalize on that demand growth in NextEra Energy, and we have the track record to prove it. Since 2021 at Energy Resources, we have originated more than 33 gigawatts of renewables and storage, while placing nearly 18 gigawatts into commercial operation. We have advanced from originating on average 8 gigawatts per year from 2021 to 2023 to approximately 11 gigawatts over the last four quarters. If we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations, this pace of development is expected to more than double our combined renewable generation portfolio, growing from 38 gigawatts today to potentially 81 gigawatts by the end of 2027. It's hard to overstate the advantage this would give us as we head into the end of the decade. This potential growth in the portfolio would enable a long-term co-located storage opportunity set of more than 50 gigawatts by the end of 2027, creating a meaningful opportunity for us to win new business and continue to deliver superior returns. Our new framework agreements with Fortune 50 companies as well as our Entergy joint development agreement announced last quarter, together with our continued origination success are key examples of our leadership in power generation. While these additions clearly demonstrate that some of the most sophisticated customers in the country understand the value proposition of renewables and storage, I want to close with a reminder of the broader economic impact to build out of renewables has had and continues to have on the U.S. economy. We have invested tens of billions of dollars in the nation's energy infrastructure, creating tens of thousands of jobs, increased tax revenues and economic stimulus for the communities we invest in. And we are powering millions of American homes and businesses with low cost, reliable and clean electricity. The fact is that renewables are a critical part of the energy infrastructure in this country. Wind, solar and storage are not only ready now and fast to deploy, but also present a cost effective solution for meeting our country's energy needs. Tens of thousands of good jobs have already been created with many more yet to come over the next several years, boosting manufacturing and helping to revitalize rural communities across America. With scale, experience and technology across the energy value chain, and sites ready to develop and interconnect today, NextEra Energy was built for this moment. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results.\nBrian Bolster : Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investment to be between $8 billion and $8.8 billion. Over the current four year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $34 billion. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 1% from the prior year comparable period. FPL grew retail sales by roughly 1.6% on a weather normalized basis, offset by milder weather. During the quarter, FPL reversed approximately $231 million of reserve amortization and FPL ended the quarter with a balance of roughly $817 million. With regard to costs associated with storm recovery, as a reminder, we have both the storm reserve and a surcharge mechanism to the extent the reserve has been fully utilized. Following Hurricane Debby, we had depleted our storm reserve and have deferred the remaining incremental cost for Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton to the balance sheet. We intend to recover those deferred costs and replenish the storm reserve via storm surcharge on customers' bills over the calendar year 2025. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.2 billion inclusive of $150 million, which will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve. Of course, the restoration cost will be subject to a final review and prudence determination by the Florida Public Service Commission. For the 12 months ending September 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. We still expect the regulatory ROE for the 12 months ending December 2024 and 2025 to be 11.4%. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 11% year-over-year. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.04 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.10 per share driven by normalization of origination activity and margins, which is consistent with our expectations. Contributions from both NextEra Energy transmission and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 3 gigawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 24 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1 gigawatt of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver on our development program expectations. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next several years. Turning now to our third quarter 2024 consolidated results, adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other were flat to last year's comparable quarter. At NextEra Energy, our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. In 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a base -- off a 2024 base. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.9175 per common unit or $3.67 per common unit on an annualized basis, up nearly 6% from a year earlier. Today, NextEra Energy Partners is pleased to announce the expected wind repowering of another approximately 225 megawatts of wind facilities, bringing its total backlog of wind repowering to approximately 1.6 gigawatts through 2026. The partnership's organic growth opportunities have expanded and we are increasing our wind repowering target to approximately 1.9 gigawatts of wind projects owned by NextEra Energy Partners through 2026, which is up from the previous target of 1.3 gigawatts. NextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high quality long-term contracted clean energy assets and has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. NextEra Energy Partners remains focused on executing additional wind repowering opportunities in the future, which we believe would provide improved operating performance and higher generation. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $453 million and cash available for distribution was $155 million. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $35 million and $92 million respectively from the same period last year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution reflect the year-over-year impact of the divestiture of the Texas Pipeline portfolio. In addition, third quarter cash available for distribution in 2024 was negatively impacted by the first interest payment on the partnership's December 2023 HoldCo debt issuance, as well as $23 million of higher project level debt service relating in large part to the 2023 acquisition financing. NextEra Energy Partners continue to expect the run rate contribution for adjusted EBITDA from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. The year end 2024 run rate projections reflect expected calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. The partnership also continues to evaluate alternatives to address its remaining convertible equity portfolio financing obligations and its cost of capital, focusing on its capital structure and the potential for redeployment of more cash flow toward driving organic cash flow growth. Given the demand for power, NextEra Energy Partners has many ways in which it can seek to grow, which could include not only acquiring assets, but also wind repowerings and potential other organic growth opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners plans to complete its review by no later than the fourth quarter 2024 call and intends to provide its distribution and run rate cash available for distribution expectations at that time. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Maybe if it's possible, I would love to get more color on the framework agreements. And I think when Brookfield announced one of these with Microsoft, you kind of downplayed wanting to do things in a framework fashion just due to the fact that you wanted to maximize the value of each site. So, could you maybe talk to the change in kind of now having framework agreements?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes, sure, Steve. This is John. First of all, the framework agreements that we have been able to strike with Entergy and with the two Fortune 50 companies that we mentioned that total over 10.5 gigawatts and 4.5 on the Entergy side, give us an enormous amount of flexibility in terms of which assets that we allocate towards those programs. And so, we're not stuck tying up inventory. And it creates a close partnership arrangement with each of these three counterparties that gives us a huge leg up in being able to secure incremental business. And what we would look for on the Entergy side, for example, is kind of a 50-50 on BOTs and PPAs, but I would think what we're doing with the framework agreements with the Fortune 50 customers would be more in the lines of power purchase agreements. I'll turn it over to Rebecca to see if she has anything to add.\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure, Steve. I think if you take a step back and you think about what's happening in our industry, and you know as well as many of us on the call, the change in demand is significant. And it has changed rapidly over the last couple of years. And the customers that we're referencing today as well as quite a number of others with whom we're in discussions with have big, important and urgent energy needs that they need to have visibility to how those are going to be met. And they want to make sure that we and they are aligned, so that they have access to our substantial pipeline of projects. You know very well there is no one else out there that has a pipeline of 100 of gigawatts of projects in various stages of development. There's no one out there that has 150 gigawatts interconnect queue positions ready to go. And these customers want to make sure we're focused on their business. And how do we do that? We get visibility to what their needs are so that we're working with them collaboratively, so that ultimately we can work to put these projects into the backlog. I think the biggest takeaway that I would have if I were in your shoes is that this is a sign of how we are differentiated from others, and how we're getting incremental visibility to the significant demand that's related to the characteristics that we all know well. And I think it's also a great sign of what John and Brian just went through about specifically the demand for renewables. Low cost, ready to deploy and aligned with the goals and objectives of the customers with which we're working. I think it's just one more sign of the great environment in which we're operating.\nSteve Fleishman: And maybe just a follow-up or two on this still. Is there a point in time when you'll be able to disclose who these agreements are with? And obviously, you can't do that now, but just are -- is it fair to say these are both hyperscalar tech type customers or other industries?\nJohn Ketchum : So, I'll take the first one, Steve. Is there a point of time where we can give names? Probably. And I think the preference of the counterparties and our preference is to go ahead and make an announcement of who they are side by side with the transaction, once we bring a deal to the table with them. And Rebecca, you want to handle the second question?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes. I think the second part of it, and we were careful to write Fortune 50 companies. These are not technology companies. And I think that's another great point is, yes, absolutely we're so many of us are talking about demand from hyperscalers and colocation datacenter developers and that demand is real and significant and we're having quite a number of conversations with all of them. But these are actually with customers that are outside of the technology industry. They are folks that are building facilities that they need to get power to. They are folks that are concerned and care about ensuring that they are low cost, ready to deploy and ideally low carbon forms of energy and capacity. So I think this is again robust sign of significant broad based demand.\nJohn Ketchum : And one thing I'll add to that, Steve, which I think is important color as investors think about the value proposition that we have going forward, given all of the demand that we're seeing from data centers, it's actually and the compression of supply and available sites ready to go. It's creating more -- even more of a premium on other industries outside of data centers to try to lock up low-cost renewable generation. And so, all ships are rising with the tide here, so to speak. So as data centers are increasing their demand, which is also increasing price, which is also increasing returns, you're also seeing other industries that are looking to secure and hedge their power exposure because they believe that power prices, they may be facing higher power prices down the road. And so it's kind of an across sector phenomenon that we're seeing, and it's so encouraging because it's very consistent with what we've been saying that this is not just the data center movement. This is a movement across industry, the electrification of industry, manufacturing, looking to decouple from China, and they're all looking for ways to control energy prices at the lowest cost possible going forward.\nSteve Fleishman: Last quick question. Just on the Duane Arnold. Is there any milestones or key steps that we should be watching out for on that opportunity?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. So we are very busy looking at Duane Arnold. We're very interested in recommissioning the plant. We're doing all the things right now that you would expect us to do. We're doing all the assessments, which include engineering assessments, includes working with the NRC. It includes working with local stakeholders. So we are continuing to advance that project. And they're obviously -- it goes without saying there's very strong interest from customers, really data center customers, in particular, around that site. But we will keep all of you posted as our evaluation progresses.\nOperator: Next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just on Steve's question on Duane Arnold. I guess, John, any sort of sense on the cost to restart that plant and other structural items we should be thinking about as you approach a decision? And ultimately, if you strike a contract with a counterparty, is this an asset you'd want to own over the long-term? Or could that be a monetization opportunity as we're thinking about your kind of ongoing balance sheet needs?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. Sure. I'll start with the first one and then go to the second. So I'm not going to give you a cost number yet because that's part of the evaluation that we're going through currently. Remember, this is a BWR, boiling water reactor. They are a lot less complex to bring back and to recommission. It's a simpler design because they don't have a steam generator like PWRs do. And so that gives us optimism at being able to do this at an attractive price and be able to execute it without as much risk that might be associated with recommissioning a plant that does not have a boiling water reactor, but is a PWR design. On the second question, our desires to own versus monetize. For us, look, I mean, this is be a very attractive asset to own. We would hope to be able to get an attractive PPA. And this would be a long-term asset that I think would fit nicely in our portfolio.\nShahriar Pourreza : And then, John, just on the NEP side, I mean, obviously, there's been a subtle change in language around timing, obviously, concluding the financial review by the year-end call. I guess, what's given the confidence this quarter to put that time line out there? Is there kind of a range of preferred outcomes that you can at least highlight to investors, especially as you've kind of removed the language around the distribution growth targets? I guess what should we read into that? I mean, obviously, the market is a little bit jittery around that language change. And can you at least confirm if you see yourself as remaining the owner of this entity into the future?\nJohn Ketchum : So as we have said to investors over the last several months, we're completing our review regarding how to address [SEPFs] and NEPs cost of capital. We've been exploring a number of options as part of that. And as we said today, we're also really reflecting on the YieldCo model itself and contemplating the strategic shift in how we allocate capital. One of the things that we are evaluating is should we put -- deploying more of our capital towards really growing the underlying cash flow of the business and maybe less towards distributions. And so that's one of the things that we're thinking about. Obviously, we have to also address the back-end convertible equity portfolio financings. But what we wanted to do is just be upfront with investors that this review is coming to a conclusion, and we'll be prepared to provide updated feedback on our distribution policy going forward on the fourth quarter call.\nShahriar Pourreza : So just reflecting on sort of the YieldCo model, it sounds like even NextEra remaining the ultimate owner of NEP is something that's a question mark as well too, right?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. Look, I think going forward our preference would be to remain the owner of NextEra Energy Partners. We've looked at -- we consider all available options and alternatives. They don't discount any potential options going forward, but our base case would be to remain the owner of NEP going forward. And Shar, the thing I want to add is we talked a lot about on this call about the underlying dynamics in the industry. We're in a period of substantial power demand in this industry. And there are many things where NextEra Energy is -- has a superior position in markets and there are going to be a number of potential growth opportunities that could favor not only NextEra Energy, but also potentially NextEra Energy Partners. Going forward, obviously, data centers being a big part of that as well. And so, we have a number of things that we're looking at that could potentially lead to attractive growth opportunities for NEP going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : John -- I know you guys are always a step ahead of everyone else here. So I wanted to get ahead here, how do you frame the discussion on safe harboring assets heading into the election outcome, whatever it may be? How would you assess derisking your plans through '27, as you guys have talked about or even frankly, beyond the '27 point in terms of proactively safe harboring your outlook, whether that's storage, solar or wind?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. We have fully derisked our safe harbor program. I mean, we're bought through '29. So those that are familiar with the safe harbor program that would -- the moves that we have made and the investments that we have made have protected our development program through the 4 year safe harbor through 2029. First -- so that's the first thing that I would say. The second piece is, don't forget, we're always very forward-looking from a supply chain perspective. And we've also -- we're very long transformers, we're very long switchgears, other electrical equipment that have caused problems for others in the industry. So we have planned ahead. We've taken all the necessary steps on safe harboring and we've also taken all the necessary steps in terms of locking up critical electric infrastructure that is leading to delays of projects by small developers, which, again, the small developers have fallen down. I think the tolerance level of our utility customer base and our C&I customer base is weathered thin and so they're now looking to -- they have too much to lose too much on the line and they want to do business with established developers like NextEra that they know are going to get their projects built on time and that plan ahead. And don't get caught off guard by some of these issues that have chronically impacted the small developer in the renewable space.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : You guys are always a step ahead as you say. Quick nuance here at Seabrook. I'm just curious, we talk about Duane here, but what's the situation there with the thoughts about New England on any further, should we say colocation or long-term off-take arrangements there with potential counterparties?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. So for us, I mean, we look at our entire nuclear fleet as part of our data center strategy. So we're sort of technology agnostic as we approach it. Most of the conversations that we have with data center customers are around renewables. But obviously, we have a comprehensive expertise across the energy value chain, whether it's wind, whether it's solar, whether it's battery storage, whether it's transmission, whether it's gas, coupled with the renewable solution and whether it's nuclear. And I think we're uniquely positioned in that regard because we do it all. We know what it all costs. We have the data to support it all. And what we try to do is have educated discussions with our customer base to provide them with the low-cost, most comprehensive clean energy solution that addresses the demands that they see going forward to satisfy their business needs.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro : Wondering if you could expand a little bit on your thoughts on SMRs as an asset. And in particular, if you might consider that at FPL over time within your resource mix?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. On SMR, so let me start with -- we have a small SMR team inside the company, right? So we have been following SMRs for a very long time. We actually advised a couple of Fortune 100 companies on SMRs today. But here's what we see. We're very close to the SMR market. There's really 9, 11, it depends on your count of how many OEMs there are in the SMR area. We look at them all. We know we do technology reviews around them. We do financial reviews around them. A lot of them are very strained financially. They are only a handful that really have capitalization that could actually carry them through the next several years. And so that's one piece. The second piece is, look, you're looking at a first-of-a-kind technology that are unproven, that comes with a ton of risk associated with that. They're still very expensive. I don't see that changing. Really as things move forward. There -- particularly as you see renewables getting cheaper, and I think renewables used for energy and storage and gas use for capacity I think, on an economic basis, tougher SMRs to compete. The other thing that doesn't get a lot of attention is nuclear fuel. The nuclear fuel supply chain has a lot of repair and work that has to occur. I think most of you know, we passed sanctions against Russia on enrichment and conversion. We basically have to start enrichment and conversion industry here in the U.S. It's going to take a lot of time to get that up and running. Some SMRs, they don't run off of low-enriched uranium, they run off of HALEU, HALEU remains a bit unproven as well. And so when we stack all that together, David, that's why we're just not bullish SMRs. We think it's kind of next -- end of the next decade alternative. But it is also something that we stay close to. And we have capacity at our existing generation facilities to be able to add SMRs. And it's something that FPL will continue to keep a close eye on also as we move forward. But again, it's so far out in the future from a viability standpoint at scale. It's -- we're prioritizing other generation resources at this time and I think renewables are, as I said in my prepared remarks are here for the long haul.\nDavid Arcaro : And then you had mentioned renewables returns earlier, just given the strong demand backdrop. Wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of the trend of renewable returns for incremental projects right now?\nJohn Ketchum : Sure. I'm going to turn that over to Rebecca.\nRebecca Kujawa : As you might expect from our comments on not only the second quarter in a row of 3 gigawatt signings and the real excitement for us on these framework agreements, not just the ones we announced, but also ones that we haven't gotten to the point of announcing. It is clearly a change dynamic in terms of need for what we have to offer. And it's safe to say that there are opportunities for us to improve margin and where that makes sense, we certainly are taking advantage of that. So I would say it's much more of an upward trajectory than staying the same and certainly not going down. And you should also expect that we will continue to be very disciplined in both the capital allocation as well as being aware of where cost of capital are. So as we've seen changes in rates, you should also expect us to respond appropriately to that. But the market dynamic for us and our unique position in this industry is a very positive tailwind for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet : Just want to turn to the near backlog additions. It looks like 3 gigs has been added the past few quarters here, and it looks like about 11 over the past year. Just wondering, I guess, your expectation for run rate backlog additions over an extended period of time. Should we be thinking kind of like 12 a year roughly? Or do you see that increasing over time? And then on Slide 5, you lay out significant demand growth there for renewables. And just wondering how you think about NextEra market share going forward there?\nRebecca Kujawa : I'll take the first stab at both of those. In terms of the run rate, just in lower gigawatt signings, I'll say the similar comments in higher quarterly signings which is we shouldn't expect these to be perfectly linear. And there will be changes quarter-to-quarter. So I'd be hesitant to say that 3 gigawatts is the new normal for now and forever more. But it is very clear and we made the comments for a reason that we have seen the change in demand that we've been talking about, and we've been expecting given both the color commentary in the marketplace as well as what's actually happening in the ground for real demand of new electrons, both in the form of energy and capacity. And I'm really proud of our team. We've invested a lot in our greenfield development program over years and developed a lot of technology and capability to ensure that we can scale that effectively and that is proving out to bring high-quality projects to market with teams that are working closely with our customers to ensure that we're getting those right projects to them at the right time, the right place and in the right price for us mutually. So clearly, a positive tailwind. And at this point, I would say we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we laid out in greater detail at the investor conference in June, where we think our overall 4 year development expectations are in aggregate through 2027. So I think this is a great quarter on route to being in those ranges. In terms of I forgot the second part of your question, actually, Jeremy, did that cover the checking part too?\nJeremy Tonet : Just market share going forward.\nRebecca Kujawa : Listen, we've over a long period of time, had ranges in the market share, I would say, across the technologies, roughly a 20% market share has been a rough consistent performance over time. I think that is certainly achievable and potentially higher. And as you know, we'll continue to balance both higher market share and higher margin, and they are interrelated to an extent. And we're going to make sure that we continue to optimize that. I don't want to build every single project that we could possibly sell to somebody. I want to build the projects that have great returns that create value for our shareholders and build incremental value for our platform over time. And that's what we are going to continue staying focused on.\nJeremy Tonet : And just quickly, I guess, on origination opportunity set, how do you see solar versus wind stacking up at this point and also big addition in batteries there. So just wondering what you're seeing currently on that front?\nRebecca Kujawa : I would say the trends are consistent with what we've talked about for the last couple of quarters and specifically in more detail at the investor conference. There's clearly a tailwind for solar and even more so for storage, relatively speaking, over the last couple of years. For solar, I think it's a couple of things. It's relatively attractive to the other generation technologies and specifically attractive with the addition of the PTC relative to what it had before, which is ITC and therefore, made it more economic and more regions in the last five to seven years. On storage, it's really about capacity value, as John outlined in our prepared remarks. It is clear that we need both energy and capacity to meet the incremental demand that utilities are seeing for the first time in decades. And storage is ready to deploy and in the places where it is needed most. So our customers are really interested in seeing those storage projects come to market. Wind has continued to be a little bit weaker relatively speaking to how strong it was for the first couple of decades of our renewables development program. There's still quite a number of customers that are interested in it. We have a good pipeline of projects in discussions with a variety of customers across the United States. And we see a mix of those resources being a good complement to one another to meet these 7/24 solutions. So having a pipeline of all three technologies has served us well, and we'll continue to pursue that path.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.\nAndrew Weisel : Just a quick couple of follow-ups actually. So first on Duane Arnold, I don't want to get too bogged down on the details, but one question I had is about transmission constraints. I know when the nuclear unit shut down, you agreed with Alliant to build a lot of solar and best storage -- battery storage. Given that the new capacity addition will take up some of the preexisting transmission capacity, will you need to expand transmission opportunity there if you were to restart the [Nuke]? And if so, would that add a lot of time in addition to the cost?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. Andrew, this is one of the benefits of having a very large pipeline. So because we have a very large pipeline, we have the ability to convert queue positions over to different types of technologies. So not concerned about the transmission.\nAndrew Weisel : Second, on the framework agreement between Entergy and the two new ones, it's about 15 gigawatts. I understand it's kind of the outer years. My question is, would any of that come to the roughly 40 gigawatts you're planning to add between now and 2027? Or should we think of this as all being helping to sustain growth beyond that -- the planning period?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. I think for now, look, we look at these opportunities as contributing to the midpoint of our expectations. Obviously, we always hope to do better and these framework agreements put us in a position to do better.\nAndrew Weisel : You don't use the word midpoint very often. Okay. Fair enough. One -- sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Ketchum : I was just going to say, midpoint is just a reference to our current development expectations. Obviously, we're pushing the team to do far better than the midpoint. And again, the framework agreement, I think gives us opportunities that we otherwise would not have had.\nAndrew Weisel : Then one subtle question about the quarterly results. Customer supply was a negative $0.10 year-over-year drag. And I know last quarter, it was minus $0.03 as well, although it was positive in the first quarter. I know it's a bit of a more volatile business, but can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for customer supply at near and maybe some thoughts on the outlook?\nJohn Ketchum : Yes. I think what you're seeing at our customer supply business. Number one is you got to remember, coming off of 2022, we had very high gas prices, which created a lot of volatility and high margins in that business, not only for us, but for others that participate in that business. Obviously, as gas prices have subsided, we've seen less volatility in that market. Some of the margins have come in a bit and more normalized. And I think we've seen that carry over to the origination activity as well. So look, that business has done great, and we expect it continue to be a solid contributor going forward, but some of what we saw coming off of '22 has subsided and that's really the commentary that we were trying to get across in our prepared remarks today.\nAndrew Weisel : And congratulations on swift storm restoration efforts.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rebecca Kujawa",
            "content": "Sure, Steve. I think if you take a step back and you think about what's happening in our industry, and you know as well as many of us on the call, the change in demand is significant. And it has changed rapidly over the last couple of years. And the customers that we're referencing today as well as quite a number of others with whom we're in discussions with have big, important and urgent energy needs that they need to have visibility to how those are going to be met. And they want to make sure that we and they are aligned, so that they have access to our substantial pipeline of projects. You know very well there is no one else out there that has a pipeline of 100 of gigawatts of projects in various stages of development. There's no one out there that has 150 gigawatts interconnect queue positions ready to go. And these customers want to make sure we're focused on their business. And how do we do that? We get visibility to what their needs are so that we're working with them collaboratively, so that ultimately we can work to put these projects into the backlog. I think the biggest takeaway that I would have if I were in your shoes is that this is a sign of how we are differentiated from others, and how we're getting incremental visibility to the significant demand that's related to the characteristics that we all know well. And I think it's also a great sign of what John and Brian just went through about specifically the demand for renewables. Low cost, ready to deploy and aligned with the goals and objectives of the customers with which we're working. I think it's just one more sign of the great environment in which we're operating. Yes. I think the second part of it, and we were careful to write Fortune 50 companies. These are not technology companies. And I think that's another great point is, yes, absolutely we're so many of us are talking about demand from hyperscalers and colocation datacenter developers and that demand is real and significant and we're having quite a number of conversations with all of them. But these are actually with customers that are outside of the technology industry. They are folks that are building facilities that they need to get power to. They are folks that are concerned and care about ensuring that they are low cost, ready to deploy and ideally low carbon forms of energy and capacity. So I think this is again robust sign of significant broad based demand. As you might expect from our comments on not only the second quarter in a row of 3 gigawatt signings and the real excitement for us on these framework agreements, not just the ones we announced, but also ones that we haven't gotten to the point of announcing. It is clearly a change dynamic in terms of need for what we have to offer.

            "name": "Brian Bolster",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.05 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investment to be between $8 billion and $8.8 billion. Over the current four year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $34 billion. FPL's third quarter retail sales increased 1% from the prior year comparable period. FPL grew retail sales by roughly 1.6% on a weather normalized basis, offset by milder weather. During the quarter, FPL reversed approximately $231 million of reserve amortization and FPL ended the quarter with a balance of roughly $817 million. With regard to costs associated with storm recovery, as a reminder, we have both the storm reserve and a surcharge mechanism to the extent the reserve has been fully utilized. Following Hurricane Debby, we had depleted our storm reserve and have deferred the remaining incremental cost for Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton to the balance sheet. We intend to recover those deferred costs and replenish the storm reserve via storm surcharge on customers' bills over the calendar year 2025. Although FPL has not completed the final accounting, our preliminary estimate of restoration costs that we plan to recover from customers through a surcharge is approximately $1.2 billion inclusive of $150 million, which will be utilized to replenish the storm reserve. Of course, the restoration cost will be subject to a final review and prudence determination by the Florida Public Service Commission. For the 12 months ending September 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. We still expect the regulatory ROE for the 12 months ending December 2024 and 2025 to be 11.4%. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 11% year-over-year. At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.04 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Comparative contribution from our customer supply and trading business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.10 per share driven by normalization of origination activity and margins, which is consistent with our expectations. Contributions from both NextEra Energy transmission and gas infrastructure businesses increased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.03 per share. Energy Resources had another strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 3 gigawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals over 24 gigawatts after taking into account roughly 1 gigawatt of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into Energy Resources' ability to deliver on our development program expectations. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next several years. Turning now to our third quarter 2024 consolidated results, adjusted EPS was $1.03 per share. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other were flat to last year's comparable quarter. At NextEra Energy, our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. In 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a base -- off a 2024 base. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.9175 per common unit or $3.67 per common unit on an annualized basis, up nearly 6% from a year earlier. Today, NextEra Energy Partners is pleased to announce the expected wind repowering of another approximately 225 megawatts of wind facilities, bringing its total backlog of wind repowering to approximately 1.6 gigawatts through 2026. The partnership's organic growth opportunities have expanded and we are increasing our wind repowering target to approximately 1.9 gigawatts of wind projects owned by NextEra Energy Partners through 2026, which is up from the previous target of 1.3 gigawatts. NextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high quality long-term contracted clean energy assets and has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. NextEra Energy Partners remains focused on executing additional wind repowering opportunities in the future, which we believe would provide improved operating performance and higher generation. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $453 million and cash available for distribution was $155 million. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $35 million and $92 million respectively from the same period last year. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution reflect the year-over-year impact of the divestiture of the Texas Pipeline portfolio. In addition, third quarter cash available for distribution in 2024 was negatively impacted by the first interest payment on the partnership's December 2023 HoldCo debt issuance, as well as $23 million of higher project level debt service relating in large part to the 2023 acquisition financing. NextEra Energy Partners continue to expect the run rate contribution for adjusted EBITDA from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. The year end 2024 run rate projections reflect expected calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. The partnership also continues to evaluate alternatives to address its remaining convertible equity portfolio financing obligations and its cost of capital, focusing on its capital structure and the potential for redeployment of more cash flow toward driving organic cash flow growth. Given the demand for power, NextEra Energy Partners has many ways in which it can seek to grow, which could include not only acquiring assets, but also wind repowerings and potential other organic growth opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners plans to complete its review by no later than the fourth quarter 2024 call and intends to provide its distribution and run rate cash available for distribution expectations at that time. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open the line for questions."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results and remains well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter increased approximately 10% year-over-year, reflecting continued solid financial and operating -- operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources. As a sign of the robust underlying demand for new renewables generation and storage, we are pleased to announce that for the second quarter in a row, we have added approximately 3 gigawatts to our backlog, bringing our running four quarter total to approximately 11 gigawatts. We are also pleased to announce incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts between now and 2030, none of which is in our backlog today. When combined with our Entergy joint development agreement from last quarter, our recent announced framework agreements now totaled up to a potential 15 gigawatts, demonstrating our unique position in the market and our customers' confidence in our ability to help meet the nation's need for power. Before I turn it over to Brian to take you through the detailed results, I want to spend a moment on FPL and Hurricanes Helene and Milton. I then will discuss our view of the industry at this transformative time. I would like to extend our deepest sympathies to all those who have been affected by the widespread destruction caused by these two hurricanes over the last month. Hurricane Helene was one of the most destructive hurricanes to ever make landfall in the continental United States. The powerful and destructive storm hit Florida as a high end Category 4 hurricane, with devastating storm surges and sustained winds of approximately 140 miles per hour, causing approximately 680,000 FPL customers to lose power. Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a high end Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of approximately 120 miles per hour, producing numerous tornadoes, widespread flooding, and causing approximately 2 million FPL customers to lose power. Hurricane Milton made landfall on the West Coast of Florida in FPL service territory in Sarasota County and exited on the East Coast of Florida in FPL service territory in Brevard County. In preparation for the hurricanes, FPL assembled a combined restoration workforce of more than 30,000 workers across these two storms. This preparation and coordinated response enabled FPL to restore service to roughly 95 affected customers after the second full day of restoration following Hurricane Helene's landfall and 95% of affected customers after the fourth full day of restoration following Hurricane Milton's landfall. I would like to thank all of our employees who made personal sacrifices leaving their own homes to serve our customers, our communities and our state. It was because of their training, their preparation, their dedication and their commitment that we were able to restore power to our customers so quickly. I would also like to thank other members of the restoration team, including the contractors, vendors and first responders that supported our efforts for their dedicated assistance during this critical time. Finally, I would like to express our sincere gratitude to Governor DeSantis for his unwavering leadership and support during these devastating hurricanes. We're also deeply grateful for the resources provided by our industry partners, who came from 41 different states in Canada to help support our customers during Hurricane Helene and Milton. Mutual aid in times of disaster was one of the hallmarks of our industry and we were proud to be able to assist other utilities to help rebuild some of the damaged southeastern power grid that saw significant impacts from Hurricane Helene in Georgia and the Carolinas. For nearly two decades, FPL has invested significantly in building a stronger, smarter and more storm resilient grid. The performance of our system demonstrates that FPL's hardening, undergrounding, automation and smart grid investments are providing significant benefits to our customers. During sustained winds of approximately 140 miles per hour during Hurricane Helene and 120 miles per hour during Hurricane Milton, our smart grid technology investments avoided 185,000 outages during Hurricane Helene and avoided 554,000 outages during Hurricane Milton. Additionally, initial performance data shows that FPL's underground distribution power lines perform more than 6x better in terms of outage rates than existing overhead distribution power lines in Florida. We are proud to report that our generation fleet, including our solar sites, sustained no significant damage. Despite 66 of FPL's 88 existing solar sites or approximately 16 million panels being exposed to storm conditions during Hurricanes Helene and Milton, less than 0.05% of our solar panels were affected. We believe these investments, together with our preparation and coordinated response have improved FPL's overall reliability and resiliency, providing significant value to our customers. The recent storms underscore the importance of a reliable and resilient power grid and this need will only intensify, as we face a period of unprecedented growth in power demand. Over the last 80 years, our sector has experienced many demand cycles from growth emerging out of the World War 2 and the Industrial Revolution to multiple decades of essentially little to flat demand. That's all changed. Today, there are forecasts for an approximate 6x increase in power demand growth in the next 20 years versus the prior 20. That significant projected shift in fundamental demand is across industries, driven in large part by 7/24 loads from data centers, reshoring to manufacturing and electrification of industry, including oil and gas and chemicals to name a few. U.S. data center power demand alone is expected to increase substantially, adding approximately 460 terawatt hours of new electricity demand at a compound annual growth rate of 22% from 2023 to 2030, which could potentially enable 150 gigawatts of new renewables and storage demand over the same period. With all of that demand -- with all of that power demand, it's important to consider what it will take to meet that demand, what type of generation will be required over the next decade or so, and importantly, when can it practically be brought to market? If that demand is not met in a smart prudent way, power prices could escalate over time and affordability could become an increasing concern, driving inflation and making U.S. industry uncompetitive on a global scale. Fortunately, at FPL, we have a playbook in place. We have been addressing the benefits and challenges of fundamental growth for years now, while continuing to deliver on our strong customer value proposition, which is anchored in bills that are nearly 40% below the national average and maintaining top decile reliability. We are making smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage, which are continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost and when combined with generation modernizations, have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001. We are delivering best-in-class non-fuel O&M, where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. Our experience at FPL puts Energy Resources in a unique position to help our customers meet their power demands. We know what it is going to take to successfully meet the challenge that is in front of our industry. We need low cost reliable energy that can also deliver the capacity needed to support grid and we need it now. Cost, capacity and speed are the three big issues that need to be addressed in meeting power demand. And as we have demonstrated in Florida, a mix of new renewable storage and gas generation is the solution. When it comes to economics, renewables and storage are the lowest cost generation and capacity resource for customers in many parts of the U.S. We believe new wind is up to 60% cheaper and new solar up to 40% cheaper than new gas power generation, and that's on a nearly firm basis when paired with a 4 hour battery. Incentives for wind, solar, and storage flow directly to customers in the form of lower bills. Over the past several years, we have seen the customer benefits of low cost solar and storage at FPL, where the two combined resources are currently the lowest cost option for customers, beating out new build gas and combined cycle units in our 10 year site plan. As a result, FPL now has the largest utility owned solar portfolio in the country. What FPL is seeing in Florida is also playing out across the rest of the country, whether with investor owned utilities, municipalities, cooperatives or commercial and industrial customers. And when it comes to speed to market, no technology is quicker to deploy than renewables and storage. Wind, solar and storage not only can be built quicker, but they're already in the interconnection queue. But don't just take our word for it, look at our backlog. We've added another approximately 3 gigawatts of renewables and storage this quarter, our second quarter in a row. As a top operator of all forms of power generation, we often get asked about nuclear and gas. Let me start with nuclear. Nuclear will play a role, but there are some practical limitations. Remember, on a national level, we expect we are going to need to add 900 gigawatts of new generation to the grid by 2040. There are only a few nuclear plants that can be recommissioned in an economic way. We are currently evaluating the recommissioning of our Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa as one example. But even with a 100% success rate on those recommissionings, we would still only meet less than 1% of that demand. Existing merchant nuclear generation is also limited in its ability to meet that demand, given there are only approximately 20 merchant nuclear plants in this country. That nuclear capacity is also not evenly spread across the U.S. And is not in many places. We know hyperscalers are looking to develop data centers or manufacturing -- manufacturers are looking to expand their footprint. For example, there are only two merchant nuclear plants west of the Mississippi. Nuclear plants across the country are already serving existing demand. So even if they are contracted by specific customers, new resources need to be built to meet new demand. And alternatives such as new utility scale nuclear and SMRs are unproven, expensive and again, not expected to be commercially viable at scale until the latter part of the next decade. Turning to gas, when it comes to gas power generation, nobody has built more over the last two decades in NextEra Energy. We understand the benefits and the challenges and we know what it all costs and how long it takes to build. The power sector is going to need to build more gas power generation and battery storage to meet growing capacity needs over the next decade. And as we build more, we also enable more renewables to come to market as the lowest cost generation source of energy. Renewables will be built for energy and battery storage and gas for capacity. That being said, while we are going to need both, storage has an advantage because it's ready now as it can be paired with renewables at the same interconnect and there are no wait times or permitting hurdles for batteries. And renewables and storage will only get cheaper and cheaper over time, and we believe will continue to make up the lion's share of new additions over the long haul. To summarize, we believe power demand is at an inflection point and we expect much of that demand to be met by renewables and storage because they're low cost, fast to deploy and in the transmission queue now. And the potential opportunity is significant. Forecasts are projecting a tripling in renewables growth over the next seven years compared to what we've seen over the prior seven. No one is better positioned to capitalize on that demand growth in NextEra Energy, and we have the track record to prove it. Since 2021 at Energy Resources, we have originated more than 33 gigawatts of renewables and storage, while placing nearly 18 gigawatts into commercial operation. We have advanced from originating on average 8 gigawatts per year from 2021 to 2023 to approximately 11 gigawatts over the last four quarters. If we achieve the midpoint of our development expectations, this pace of development is expected to more than double our combined renewable generation portfolio, growing from 38 gigawatts today to potentially 81 gigawatts by the end of 2027. It's hard to overstate the advantage this would give us as we head into the end of the decade. This potential growth in the portfolio would enable a long-term co-located storage opportunity set of more than 50 gigawatts by the end of 2027, creating a meaningful opportunity for us to win new business and continue to deliver superior returns. Our new framework agreements with Fortune 50 companies as well as our Entergy joint development agreement announced last quarter, together with our continued origination success are key examples of our leadership in power generation. While these additions clearly demonstrate that some of the most sophisticated customers in the country understand the value proposition of renewables and storage, I want to close with a reminder of the broader economic impact to build out of renewables has had and continues to have on the U.S. economy. We have invested tens of billions of dollars in the nation's energy infrastructure, creating tens of thousands of jobs, increased tax revenues and economic stimulus for the communities we invest in. And we are powering millions of American homes and businesses with low cost, reliable and clean electricity. The fact is that renewables are a critical part of the energy infrastructure in this country. Wind, solar and storage are not only ready now and fast to deploy, but also present a cost effective solution for meeting our country's energy needs. Tens of thousands of good jobs have already been created with many more yet to come over the next several years, boosting manufacturing and helping to revitalize rural communities across America. With scale, experience and technology across the energy value chain, and sites ready to develop and interconnect today, NextEra Energy was built for this moment. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results. Yes, sure, Steve. This is John. First of all, the framework agreements that we have been able to strike with Entergy and with the two Fortune 50 companies that we mentioned that total over 10.5 gigawatts and 4.5 on the Entergy side, give us an enormous amount of flexibility in terms of which assets that we allocate towards those programs. And so, we're not stuck tying up inventory. And it creates a close partnership arrangement with each of these three counterparties that gives us a huge leg up in being able to secure incremental business. And what we would look for on the Entergy side, for example, is kind of a 50-50 on BOTs and PPAs, but I would think what we're doing with the framework agreements with the Fortune 50 customers would be more in the lines of power purchase agreements. I'll turn it over to Rebecca to see if she has anything to add. So, I'll take the first one, Steve. Is there a point of time where we can give names? Probably. And I think the preference of the counterparties and our preference is to go ahead and make an announcement of who they are side by side with the transaction, once we bring a deal to the table with them. And Rebecca, you want to handle the second question? And one thing I'll add to that, Steve, which I think is important color as investors think about the value proposition that we have going forward, given all of the demand that we're seeing from data centers, it's actually and the compression of supply and available sites ready to go. It's creating more -- even more of a premium on other industries outside of data centers to try to lock up low-cost renewable generation. And so, all ships are rising with the tide here, so to speak. So as data centers are increasing their demand, which is also increasing price, which is also increasing returns, you're also seeing other industries that are looking to secure and hedge their power exposure because they believe that power prices, they may be facing higher power prices down the road. And so it's kind of an across sector phenomenon that we're seeing, and it's so encouraging because it's very consistent with what we've been saying that this is not just the data center movement. This is a movement across industry, the electrification of industry, manufacturing, looking to decouple from China, and they're all looking for ways to control energy prices at the lowest cost possible going forward. Yes. So we are very busy looking at Duane Arnold. We're very interested in recommissioning the plant. We're doing all the things right now that you would expect us to do. We're doing all the assessments, which include engineering assessments, includes working with the NRC. It includes working with local stakeholders. So we are continuing to advance that project. And they're obviously -- it goes without saying there's very strong interest from customers, really data center customers, in particular, around that site. But we will keep all of you posted as our evaluation progresses. Yes. Sure. I'll start with the first one and then go to the second. So I'm not going to give you a cost number yet because that's part of the evaluation that we're going through currently. Remember, this is a BWR, boiling water reactor. They are a lot less complex to bring back and to recommission. It's a simpler design because they don't have a steam generator like PWRs do. And so that gives us optimism at being able to do this at an attractive price and be able to execute it without as much risk that might be associated with recommissioning a plant that does not have a boiling water reactor, but is a PWR design. On the second question, our desires to own versus monetize. For us, look, I mean, this is be a very attractive asset to own. We would hope to be able to get an attractive PPA. And this would be a long-term asset that I think would fit nicely in our portfolio. So as we have said to investors over the last several months, we're completing our review regarding how to address [SEPFs] and NEPs cost of capital. We've been exploring a number of options as part of that. And as we said today, we're also really reflecting on the YieldCo model itself and contemplating the strategic shift in how we allocate capital. One of the things that we are evaluating is should we put -- deploying more of our capital towards really growing the underlying cash flow of the business and maybe less towards distributions. And so that's one of the things that we're thinking about. Obviously, we have to also address the back-end convertible equity portfolio financings. But what we wanted to do is just be upfront with investors that this review is coming to a conclusion, and we'll be prepared to provide updated feedback on our distribution policy going forward on the fourth quarter call. Yes. Look, I think going forward our preference would be to remain the owner of NextEra Energy Partners. We've looked at -- we consider all available options and alternatives. They don't discount any potential options going forward, but our base case would be to remain the owner of NEP going forward. And Shar, the thing I want to add is we talked a lot about on this call about the underlying dynamics in the industry. We're in a period of substantial power demand in this industry. And there are many things where NextEra Energy is -- has a superior position in markets and there are going to be a number of potential growth opportunities that could favor not only NextEra Energy, but also potentially NextEra Energy Partners. Going forward, obviously, data centers being a big part of that as well. And so, we have a number of things that we're looking at that could potentially lead to attractive growth opportunities for NEP going forward. Yes. We have fully derisked our safe harbor program. I mean, we're bought through '29. So those that are familiar with the safe harbor program that would -- the moves that we have made and the investments that we have made have protected our development program through the 4 year safe harbor through 2029. First -- so that's the first thing that I would say. The second piece is, don't forget, we're always very forward-looking from a supply chain perspective. And we've also -- we're very long transformers, we're very long switchgears, other electrical equipment that have caused problems for others in the industry. So we have planned ahead. We've taken all the necessary steps on safe harboring and we've also taken all the necessary steps in terms of locking up critical electric infrastructure that is leading to delays of projects by small developers, which, again, the small developers have fallen down. I think the tolerance level of our utility customer base and our C&I customer base is weathered thin and so they're now looking to -- they have too much to lose too much on the line and they want to do business with established developers like NextEra that they know are going to get their projects built on time and that plan ahead. And don't get caught off guard by some of these issues that have chronically impacted the small developer in the renewable space. Yes. So for us, I mean, we look at our entire nuclear fleet as part of our data center strategy. So we're sort of technology agnostic as we approach it. Most of the conversations that we have with data center customers are around renewables. But obviously, we have a comprehensive expertise across the energy value chain, whether it's wind, whether it's solar, whether it's battery storage, whether it's transmission, whether it's gas, coupled with the renewable solution and whether it's nuclear. And I think we're uniquely positioned in that regard because we do it all. We know what it all costs. We have the data to support it all. And what we try to do is have educated discussions with our customer base to provide them with the low-cost, most comprehensive clean energy solution that addresses the demands that they see going forward to satisfy their business needs. Yes. On SMR, so let me start with -- we have a small SMR team inside the company, right? So we have been following SMRs for a very long time. We actually advised a couple of Fortune 100 companies on SMRs today. But here's what we see. We're very close to the SMR market. There's really 9, 11, it depends on your count of how many OEMs there are in the SMR area. We look at them all. We know we do technology reviews around them. We do financial reviews around them. A lot of them are very strained financially. They are only a handful that really have capitalization that could actually carry them through the next several years. And so that's one piece. The second piece is, look, you're looking at a first-of-a-kind technology that are unproven, that comes with a ton of risk associated with that. They're still very expensive. I don't see that changing. Really as things move forward. There -- particularly as you see renewables getting cheaper, and I think renewables used for energy and storage and gas use for capacity I think, on an economic basis, tougher SMRs to compete. The other thing that doesn't get a lot of attention is nuclear fuel. The nuclear fuel supply chain has a lot of repair and work that has to occur. I think most of you know, we passed sanctions against Russia on enrichment and conversion. We basically have to start enrichment and conversion industry here in the U.S. It's going to take a lot of time to get that up and running. Some SMRs, they don't run off of low-enriched uranium, they run off of HALEU, HALEU remains a bit unproven as well. And so when we stack all that together, David, that's why we're just not bullish SMRs. We think it's kind of next -- end of the next decade alternative. But it is also something that we stay close to. And we have capacity at our existing generation facilities to be able to add SMRs. And it's something that FPL will continue to keep a close eye on also as we move forward. But again, it's so far out in the future from a viability standpoint at scale. It's -- we're prioritizing other generation resources at this time and I think renewables are, as I said in my prepared remarks are here for the long haul. Sure. I'm going to turn that over to Rebecca. Yes. Andrew, this is one of the benefits of having a very large pipeline. So because we have a very large pipeline, we have the ability to convert queue positions over to different types of technologies. So not concerned about the transmission. Yes. I think for now, look, we look at these opportunities as contributing to the midpoint of our expectations. Obviously, we always hope to do better and these framework agreements put us in a position to do better. I was just going to say, midpoint is just a reference to our current development expectations. Obviously, we're pushing the team to do far better than the midpoint. And again, the framework agreement, I think gives us opportunities that we otherwise would not have had. Yes. I think what you're seeing at our customer supply business. Number one is you got to remember, coming off of 2022, we had very high gas prices, which created a lot of volatility and high margins in that business, not only for us, but for others that participate in that business. Obviously, as gas prices have subsided, we've seen less volatility in that market. Some of the margins have come in a bit and more normalized. And I think we've seen that carry over to the origination activity as well. So look, that business has done great, and we expect it continue to be a solid contributor going forward, but some of what we saw coming off of '22 has subsided and that's really the commentary that we were trying to get across in our prepared remarks today."

In addition, through the first six months of the year, our adjusted earnings per share has increased 9.4% year-over-year. The continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources position our company well to meet its overall objectives for the year. At FPL, we have continued to deliver for our customers on multiple fronts since the start of our most recent rate settlement in 2022. We are making smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage. We\u2019re continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost and combined with generation modernizations have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001. We are delivering best in class non-fuel O&M where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. A big driver of our outperformance has been our team and culture of continuous improvement and productivity. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than through our annual companywide initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. This year, we identified record $460 million of run rate cost savings opportunities through 2027, part of which benefit FPL and its customers. By finding opportunities to take cost out of the business and making smart capital investments to reduce its fuel costs, FPL has kept residential bills nearly 40% below the national average and by far the lowest among all the Florida investor owned utilities. FPL\u2019s reliability also ranks among the best in the industry, where we are 66% better than the national average in the number of minutes a customer's power is interrupted per year. I'm most proud of the fact we continue to deliver on our customer value proposition during a period of unprecedented growth in Florida. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the U. S. with roughly 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. And it's not just the residential sector. We're seeing the commercial and industrial sector growing too. As a result of this accelerated growth, FPL's regulatory capital employed has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate since the beginning of 2022 compared against an estimated 9% comp in annual growth rate that was originally anticipated for the four year settlement period. We have shouldered this additional growth through our reserve amortization mechanism, which enables FPL to absorb the cost for these capital investments without increasing customer bills in the interim. While these efforts have helped us to meet customer growth and deliver for our Florida customers, our reserve amortization mechanism has been utilized faster than expected. FPL fully expects to seek recovery of these increased expenditures in its rate case filing next year. FPL ended the second quarter with a remaining reserve amortization balance of $586 million which is expected to be sufficient to support FPL's capital investment plan and its ability to earn an 11.4% regulatory ROE this year and next. An 11.4% percent regulatory ROE is expected to have a $0.06 EPS impact in each of 2024 and 2025, which has already been taken into account in our financial expectations, and we will be disappointed if we are unable to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges each year through 2027 at NextEra Energy. We expect to continue to demonstrate the benefits and protections that the reserve amortization mechanism provides customers when we file our rate case next year. Our vision is for FPL to be the best utility franchise in the country by doubling down on what we do best, delivering low bills and high reliability for our customers by making smart capital investments and being an industry leader on costs. These attributes are important to our customers and regulators, and they are important to us. We look forward to continuing to deliver on what we believe is an outstanding customer value proposition at FPL. Growth is not only occurring inside Florida, but outside Florida as well. At Energy Resources, we are benefiting from two types of demand, replacement cycle and gross cycle demand. With regard to the former, we have long been a beneficiary of a replacement cycle where higher cost, less efficient generation has been retired in favor of low cost renewables and battery storage. We expect this to continue and while replacement cycle demand has been around for a long time, growth cycle demand is new. With the exception of a few states such as Florida, power demand from new growth has been static in our industry for decades. That's changing as power demand is projected to grow 4x faster over the next 2 decades compared to the prior two. That growth is being driven by demand across multiple sectors, which is expected to create a long term opportunity for faster deploy low cost generation. As highlighted at our investor conference, we expect the demand for new renewables to triple over the next seven years versus the prior seven to help meet this increased power demand. Energy Resources couldn't be better positioned as it has a 300 gigawatt pipeline, half of which is in the interconnection queue process or is already interconnection ready. Our scaled experience and technology coupled with our ability to build new transmission where required enable us to meet the growing demands of our power and commercial and industrial customer base. Underpinning these competitive advantages are our decades of data, analytical capabilities and experience with system operators and relationships with utilities that position us well to get the power to where it needs to go. Our continued ability to drive origination results speaks for itself. Energy Resources added over 3,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects for the backlog this quarter, 860 megawatts of which come from agreements with Google to meet their data center power demand. This marks our second best origination quarter ever. These results support our belief that the bulk of the growth demand will be met by a combination of new renewables and battery storage. The importance of renewable and storage to help meet our economies growing demand for power has never been more evident. As data center growth accelerates to facilitate our economy shift to artificial intelligence, and as we continue to re-domesticate and electrify across multiple sectors, our nation must embrace an all of the above strategy to meet increasing electric demand. Renewables and storage are energy independent as they rely on American wind and sunshine. They also are extremely fast to deploy compared to alternative forms of generation making them vital to our country's success going forward. And importantly, the country has stood up a significant domestic industry to support their growth, which is driving investment in factories and is creating good paying jobs and a tax base that is revitalizing rural communities across America. As customers increasingly demand smart clean energy solutions, we are the company with experience in every part of the energy value chain and are uniquely positioned to help them make the right decisions for their business. As the owner and operator of a large natural gas-fired fleet in Florida, we are also conscious of the importance of natural gas-fired generation as a bridge fuel. Yet, we also are well aware of the realities of new build gas-fired generation. It's more expensive in most states, is subject to fuel price volatility and takes considerable time given the need to get gas delivered generating unit and the three to four year waiting period for gas turbines. Low cost, fast to deploy renewables help keep power prices down, making our economy more competitive globally. Ultimately, our country needs all forms of energy as we move forward and the future has never been brighter for the power generation sector as a whole and renewables in particular. As I've been saying, NextEra Energy was built for this moment and our future outlook has never been stronger. Our strategic focus is to deliver low cost clean energy and storage for customers both inside and outside Florida, while building new transmission where required to support new generation. We have the playbook and the platform to win in any environment and most importantly, we have the team. Our competitive advantages continue to grow every day, providing industry differentiation that is over two decades in the making and difficult to replicate. And I firmly believe, we will continue to expand that strategic distance, creating value for customers and shareholders. Nobody is better positioned to meet the demands of the energy customer of tomorrow than NextEra Energy. And I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results beginning with FPL.\nBrian Bolster: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.03 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 10.7% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $8 billion $8.8 billion. Over the current four year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $3 billion, $4 billion. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.7% from the prior year comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage for costumer of approximately 2.6%. As a result FPL grew retail sales in second quarter by roughly 1.1% on a weather normalized basis. For the 12 months ending June 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% and the 11.4% regulatory ROE mentioned previously is expected to be realized in the fourth quarter for the 12-months ending December 2024. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 10.8% per year -- at 10.8% year-over-year and Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.03 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio increased $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting an increase in wind resources during the quarter. Wind resource for the Q2 of 2024 was approximately 104% of the long term average versus 88% in the second quarter of 2023. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.03 per share. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business decreased by $0.07 per share, due to a combination of higher depletion expense related to lower production estimates, certain non-recurring items and the sale of the Texas pipelines by NextEra Energy Partners. While we may see a few pennies impact again next quarter, we expect gas infrastructure's earnings growth to be effectively flat going forward as we continue to allocate more capital on a relative basis to renewables, storage and transmission. Similar to what we saw this quarter, the increased contributions from new investment driven by the strength of our renewable development program are expected to more than offset any slowing in gas infrastructure growth going forward. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. Energy resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding 3,000 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 22.6 gigawatts after taking into account more than 1,600 megawatts of new projects placed in the service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into energy resources ability to deliver on our development program expectations which we recently extended at our Investor Conference. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next few years and into 2028. Energy resources 300 gigawatt pipeline is years in the making and ready to respond to customer demand. We have competitive advantages understanding transmission and grid constraints. We have strong relationships with utilities serving the growing power grid. We can build system solutions across stakeholders and customer needs, and we can leverage our proprietary technology to site and deploy the best projects for our customers. A great example is our collaboration with Entergy, where we are targeting to build 4.5 gigawatts of renewable storage solutions to help them meet both their new increased load demand and energy transition goals. And we couldn't be more excited to work with a long-term established customer in order to help them execute on these goals. Another example is our collaboration with Google. As John said earlier, this quarter's backlog addition include 860 megawatts signed with Google to support their data center needs. That brings our total renewables portfolio with technology and data center customers, including assets in operation and in backlog to 7 gigawatts. Our competitive position is even further advantaged by our existing portfolio, with interconnection timelines for new sites stretching for three to seven years or beyond. We can dramatically improve our speed to market by utilizing the existing interconnection from our operating footprint to deploy co-located solar and storage, as well as execute on wind and potentially solar repowers. This optionality provides a unique resource to meet our customer needs, while also capitalizing on the embedded option value from the existing portfolio. Beyond renewables and storage, we're excited to say that Mountain Valley Pipeline is now in service. Turning now to Q2 2024 consolidated results. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year. During the quarter, NextEra issued $2 billion of equity units and recently Energy Resources entered into an agreement with Blackstone to sell a partial interest in a portfolio of wind and solar projects for approximately $900 million. Our long-term financial expectations, which we stated last month at our Investor Conference, remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least \u201826 off of 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Turning next to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.95 per common unit or $3.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 6% from a year earlier. Turning to the balance sheet, since our last earnings call, the partnership completed the next net renewables to equity buyout of roughly $190 million in June 2024 and paid down our 2024 convertible maturity with cash on hand. After repayment of a $700 million HoldCo debt maturity earlier this month, the partnership now has approximately $2.7 billion of liquidity. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $560 million and cash available for distribution was $220 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 780 net megawatts of new assets that either closed in the Q2 of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023 contributed approximately $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $9 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects grew by approximately $62 million year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable wind resource during the quarter and partially offset by lower solar generation. Wind resources approximately 103% of the long term average versus 88% in the second of 2023. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $46 million and $43 million respectively, from the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio, which is partially offset by the interest benefit of the remaining cash proceeds received from the sale of these assets. From a base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.52. The partnership continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with the current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable product range of expectations through at least 2026. NextEra Energy Partners expects the partner's payout ratio to be in the mid to high 90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. In terms of next steps for NextEra Energy Partners, as we have discussed with you previously, the partnership is continuing to look at all options to secure a competitive cost of capital and to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts. At the same time, the partnership's 6% distribution growth target remains for now. NextEra Energy Partners does not need an acquisition related financing in 2024 to meet its 6% target and does not need gross equity until 2027. NextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high quality long term contracted clean energy assets and the partnership has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. We expect to share more in the coming quarters as we address these objectives. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2024. As a further reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Just first on the comments on the kind of update on the reserve amortization and earned ROE. Could you just go back through that again, John, in terms of just the -- what's driven the increased usage? Is it just that you've ramped up capital a lot quicker than initially planned? Or just maybe give a little bit of color on -- a little more color on that comment?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah. No, absolutely, Steve. So we've had a lot of population growth in Florida, a lot of that has impacted our service territory. When we first entered in the settlement agreement, back in \u201921, we\u2019ve got our regulatory capital employed to be around 9%. It's actually been around 12% as we have accommodated that growth. And so we've got surplus that's right around $586 million today as we look forward for this year and next based on where we are, the capital plans that we have for the FPL business, which are still very strong to take into account the further growth that we see. We believe that with that amortization balance and those CapEx plans will probably be right around an 11.4% ROE for the full year '24 and for the full year \u201825. And that has about a $0.06 impact here this year and a $0.06 impact next year. It's already folded into our financial expectations and not a concern in terms of our ability to cover it. And a big plus from the Steve is, it really I think is a good fact heading into a refiling in 2025 because it demonstrates how the surplus mechanism can really help customers. And the last point that I'll make is don't forget these additional capital investments that we've made, we would expect to see full recovery of in our next filing. So this remember that the surplus mechanism is intended really just to deal with the regulatory lag as we make new investments at FPL to accommodate the additional growth. So we're not worried about this. This is something that is something that we feel very comfortable about addressing in our financial expectations and doesn't impact where we feel like we will end up this year and next.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, thanks. And then on the Blackstone financing that you mentioned, the $900 million any information on just the size of the portfolio that was sold and or the stake in that portfolio?\nJohn Ketchum: Yeah, it was 1.6 gigawatt portfolio just a mix of renewable assets. And I think the real positive takeaway here for investors is there's a real demand for NextEra assets. I mean, we are recognized in the private equity market as being really the top developer. And given all the growth and this quarter is a great example of the 3 gigawatts that we were able to do. We have a strong trajectory going forward. And as private equity has opportunities to work with us and we have a long history of working with private equity going back the last five or six years. It really is a good potential win-win for us and for them. With the Blackstone organization, we really like the capability that they bring to the table and there's a lot of crossover between our two organizations in terms of what we do. And so this was a good fit for us.\nSteve Fleishman: And just is what's the percent stake a piece of the 1.6% or their stake is 1.6%?\nJohn Ketchum: They invested capital alongside us. And so they have a partial interest in that portfolio of 1.6 gigawatts.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. And then last question, just on the recent issue. I know you're not doing offshore wind, but just this recent issue with the GE turbines -- turbine at Vineyard Wind, and I know there was a lawsuit filed by AEP. Can you just maybe talk to your turbine performance with them and just are you seeing any issues and how you're feeling about that?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, for us, I mean, look, first I'll start with the fact that we are a top tensile operator of wind. I think really recognized as the best operator of wind in the business. And we have a real partnership with GE, and so, look, wind turbines have moving parts, they'll have issues from time to time. But our partnership with GE runs 20 years and so we've really never had issues in getting things and we're always able to structure win-win arrangements with them. So as any problems arise to the portfolio they've always been well managed and addressed in a conciliatory way with GE and future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: So just real quick, I want to start on NEP. I mean, obviously, you guys have the standard language around continuing to evaluate all options. I mean, Brian obviously reiterated the current CAGR, but also used the word for now core-on-core which is somewhat new language, believe it or not. Could we get a sense on timing, what range of options you're thinking about? And I guess how confident are you we can get something done at favorable pricing before the dividend goes under some level of pressure in '27?\nBrian Bolster: Hey, thanks, Shah. Obviously, NEP is getting a lot of our attention in terms of looking at what the alternatives are to both improve the cost of capital, which really requires us to be able to successfully address the back end [SEPFs]. And as we said in the prepared remarks, all options are on the table. And what we really are spending time on and we are looking at various solutions around this is how do you tackle those back end setups in a constructive way that makes sense in terms of the cost of capital that would be required to do that and then how do we put NEP in a better position for success going forward. So as part of that, we are obviously exploring all alternatives. We've mentioned private capital as one potential avenue there as well. The good thing is that we have time. We have time in 2024. We've said in the market, we don't have to do anything, we don't have a drops plan for '24, don't have growth equity needs until '27. And so we are being thoughtful about our approach around NEP.\nShahriar Pourreza: And I think Brian just to not to take words out of [indiscernible] mentioned in the next couple of quarters is that -- is this something maybe we'll get to some sort of a definitive direction this year?\nBrian Bolster: Yes. Sure. I don't want to put a firm deadline on it. But I think the language we use is over the next few quarters and once we have identified a solution that we think makes sense then obviously we will share that but not until then.\nShahriar Pourreza: And then just on NEE obviously just congrats on a very strong origination quarter, it was definitely on the higher end, Google was a key contributor. I guess do your sort of existing contract protections and supply chain maybe strategy like to kind of navigate some of the challenges in this space as you're continuing to expand development to maybe much higher levels, right? So can supply chain kind of these bottlenecks that we've seen become a governor around backlog additions as we look through '25 and beyond, especially as you're trying to meet the needs of these large energy intensive customers like the hyperscalers?\nBrian Bolster: So here's how I think about supply chain. These are number one, there is been some attention around AD/CVD filing and tariffs and those things. We're not impacted. And I made the comment and we spent a lot of time with this both in March and then at our Investor Conference in June still matters more than ever in this business. So the way I would think about it from an investor perspective is the bigger our program, the more leverage we have over our supplier. And in the last couple of years, we have really spent a lot of time and made investment around the data and analytical capability that we have around our supply chain. And we have also made a very conscientious effort around risk transfer and making sure that we have adequate securities to provide incentive to perform. So we are in a position where we have really been able to transfer any tariff for AD/CVD or related risks over to our suppliers. Why is that? The reason for that is when putting numbers up like 3 gigawatts a quarter and have the type of build that we have and expect to have going forward. The contractors and vendors want to work with us. And they've also seen a lot of small developers that ultimately haven't been able to arrange financing or for whatever reason haven't had terrific follow through on their projects. That's not the case with our company. And so there's been even a greater emphasis I would say by our suppliers who want to work with us more than ever. But what that means is making sure that we are always left in a position where we are not taking risks around the obvious things that you might put on your list. And so I really feel better than ever about where we stand from a supply chain perspective and I am very happy with the job that our team has done and the lessons that we've learned over the last couple of years have all been folded into how we contractually approach risk in our agreements going forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, a pleasure. Yes, likewise. Can you speak to how you're thinking about asset recycling here? I mean, I'm curious specifically on the latest portfolio sell down right with Blackstone as mentioned earlier. But how do you think about other assets here? As you think about like for instance some of these headlines on transmission or gas infra is being in focus. It's notable after the FCG sale last year. How do you think about continued monetization of renewable assets or portfolios relative to sort of the ongoing streamlining and focusing back to the core renewables business, if you will? And then related, how do you think about that 70-30 mix, as you pair back, as you pair these different asset sales through the forecast period?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes. No, good question, Julien. So from a recycling standpoint, feel better than I ever have in terms of the options that we have going forward for the portfolio. In terms of asset mix and how we think about that, obviously, we've always had a history of being able to recycle capital around renewables, which are terrific assets which I think we have a great reputation in the market around and our ability to attract capital on the renewable portfolio. But look, we are also making a conscientious effort and I think I made these comments at the Investor Conference that we're looking at our core business, right. Our core business is wind, it's solar, it's battery storage, it's transmission both inside Florida, outside of Florida. And so to the extent we can do some targeted capital recycling around our gas infrastructure business that will continue to be top of mind. Transmission, you raised as well. We are having a lot of success in transmission and the team has done a terrific job I think on the competitive transmission side of identifying new opportunities, and just based on the return structure that we could target, there's good sense to bring in a partner on some of those deals. And so those have been opportunities that we have been targeting as well as we think about the future. But obviously it puts us in a position where we continue to manage those assets and those opportunities as we think about how they contribute to the future. But those certainly are 2 things that we look at in addition to the renewable portfolio. And the numbers that we gave at the Investor Conference, I certainly don't lose any sleepover in terms of the ability to meet those capital recycling targets. From a business mix perspective, I think which is your last question, you know and I think most folks on the phone know that we are very rigorous about looking at our five year forecast and even go beyond that. And so we're constantly looking at our mix and what our obligations are and undertakings are with the agencies and we have a lot of headroom, a lot of headroom on our business mix. So that is not an issue, that is not a concern and the capital recycling plan I think fits well with what our undertakings are there, but plenty ahead of room on business mix.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And just clarification on the last question. Just with respect to getting that 3 gigawatt milestone for the quarter here in terms of bookings, is that kind of a good new run rate here or again given the size of these new counterparties is it going to be fairly lumpy moving up and down quarter to quarter here. Just trying to set, a little bit of an expectation there.\nJohn Ketchum: Absolutely. I'm going to turn that one over to Rebecca.\nRebecca Kujawa: Good morning, Julian. We couldn't be more excited about the origination, not only that we've been able to produce over the last couple of years, each of them being a record in their own right and then the first two quarters being each of them, ironically, the second best quarter, obviously, this quarter topping last quarter that we've ever had. I'll caveat it that origination can be a little bit lumpy. I've consistently said that in quarters where it's a little bit lower than where we are today. And I think I even said it the day that we set the top quarterly additions a couple of quarters ago. So there's always a little bit of bumpiness in there, but what we continue to see is consistent with the comments that we all made at the Investor Conference just last month, that and John talked about in his opening remarks today that the combination of the replacement cycle and the growth cycle is a tremendously positive outlook for us over the very long-term. Some of this is going to take a little bit longer to materialize on the growth side, as we also highlighted last month. As you'll see some of those stronger additions of the 3 gigawatts that we added to our backlog, particularly notably strong in years '26 and '27, and even some megawatts added to '28 and beyond. But overall, what we see today and the execution of our team and the value proposition that we bring to our customers is a very bright outlook. Excellent.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays.\nNick Campanella : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for all the information today. I just wanted to follow-up on Shah's comments. You talked about being able to kind of pass through some of these higher tariff costs to the extent they kind of materialize. Just there's also a projection for two rate cuts this year and I'm just curious if you can kind of talk about how that changes the returns for near that you kind of communicated at the Analyst Day in previous quarters, if you could just update us on that?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. First of all, as you know, we are always looking to manage risk around our capital investment decisions. And one of those risks is it's not only locking in equipment cost, it's not only locking in labor, but it's also locking in our cost of capital. So as we approach our renewable portfolio, we've been very mindful of making sure that we are locking in our cost of capital through interest rate hedge products swaps in that regard. As I think about the future and the rate the one, the two rate cuts, who knows where we ultimately end up on those fronts. Obviously given the financing plans that we have moving forward, those would be tailwinds for the business. But at the same time, if those don't materialize, we have already taken those into account in our financial expectations and we're very prudent and on top of managing the risk the interest rate risk exposure that we have across the business.\nNick Campanella: Hey, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then, John, I think you've been pretty clear about the ability to supplement this power demand inflection with new renewables. And you also have this nuclear portfolio. I understand a lot of that's kind of contracted, but there were headlines about potential Duane Arnold restart. I guess how realistic is that? Is that something you'd even kind of consider at this juncture? And how do we kind of think about the strategic positioning of your nuclear portfolio?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. Thanks, Nick, for that question on nuclear. With regard to Duane Arnold, I think there would be opportunities and a lot of demand from the market if we were able to do something with Duane Arnold. Obviously bringing back a nuclear plant is into service is not something that you can do without a lot of thought. And it is something that we are looking at, but there is a lot of thought that has to go into it and obviously a real assessment around risks associated with that as well. And so sure, we're looking at it, but we would only do it if we could do it in a way that is essentially risk free with plenty of mitigants around the approach and there are a few things that we would have to work through. But yes, we are looking at it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to get a little bit more color on renewables market right now as you've discussed very strong demand in the market. And just wondering going back to some of the comments at the Analyst Day, what trends you see in PPA pricing at this point and how could that potentially benefit NextEra going forward?\nRebecca Kujawa: Thanks, Jeremy. Appreciate the conversation and question. We've continued to see very strong returns with respect to what we think we need in order to be highly confident that we're adding shareholder value, and I would think about the returns that we laid out at the Investor Conferences is almost minimum thresholds that we have at this point. And there are opportunities, where there's significant customer demand. We have unique positioning in the marketplace to make sure that we get even more attractive returns. I'd say it's a very positive dynamic. It was a very difficult market over the last couple of years when we were seeing the supply chain disruption and increasing pricing, both on the capital equipment side and the ROE side and our returns. And fortunately, we've either seen slightly declining or at a minimum stable backdrop, which is certainly helpful for decreasing our risk and also providing an attractive price and attractive product to our customers. So between the attractive price, the speed to market, the clean attribute of renewables and storage as well as the fact as we talked about last month in the queue across the United States today, all of the projects that are looking to be connected, 90% of those megawatts are renewables and storage, and we have a healthy portion of those. And I couldn't be more excited about our position. So I think we're in a great shape to continue to add a lot of shareholder value in the many years ahead.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: We're hearing utilities around the country now with fast growing pipelines, thousands of megawatts of data center requests. It seems to be moving rapidly just month by month they seem to be learning more, getting more demand. I'm wondering just do you think that's already in your numbers, in your renewables targets here or could we potentially see another wave of demand as some of these utilities nail down just how much load is really coming into their service territories?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hi David, it's Rebecca, I'll chime in here. We certainly are hearing from our power sector customers a lot of interest, from various data center customers, whether the data center operators or the hyperscalers. It is a little bit challenging to see how much of that is potentially multiple requests for ultimately the same data center, but there is no escaping the fact that these are very large numbers and things that numbers that I don't think any utility across the industry has seen before. And so it's going to take some time not only to rationalize that and figure out how you address it, but also to procure and bring online the megawatts and the transmission over the long term that is going to be required to serve this demand if it ends up being as strong as we see it and we think it might be. From our perspective, consistent with our comments from last month, we are seeing a lot of interest both from the power sector customers as well as hyperscalers and data center customers. You're clearly seeing some of that show up in our origination, but you're also seeing some of that more of that show up in this '26 and '27 timeframe and now even '28 as we are lining up these projects to support when they will come online for our utility customers. So I think we all are very excited. It is very interesting for our sector to see this growth that we haven't seen in a couple of decades. But I do think from a practical standpoint, it's going to take a couple of years for this really to materialize and utilities to be able to absorb it and serve it. But that's a terrific backdrop for us. Some of these challenges are going to be difficult to solve, and I believe there's no better company to partner with our customers to help solve them.\nDavid Arcaro : Yes, understood. Thanks for that color. And then I was curious on hyperscaler deals. Are there any other details you would be able to provide around the Google relationship here, just maybe the location or timing of when these projects are coming on? Is it a single location or multiple locations? Are you embedding wind, solar storage, multiple technologies in terms of what product maybe makes sense for these hyperscaler deals? And then just along those same lines, would you be interested in some kind of a multi-gigawatt, multi-year framework? Is that an idea that you're pursuing with these bigger hyperscaler customers?\nRebecca Kujawa: Sure. Well, David, I'll answer it more broadly than just specific to one certainly for a variety of reasons, including sensitivities. Some of these comments would otherwise be sent for them for their own competitive positioning. But those specifically were new contracts, and they were to support data center demand wind, solar and battery storage. And then more broadly speaking from a hyperscalars perspective, they are interested in a variety of technologies, wind solar and battery storage. And they I would say probably the biggest change for many of them is a shift or certainly an increasing percentage of these projects that are very specifically associated with the data centers that these hyperscalars are trying to build. So it's less interest in just a pure virtual power purchase agreement where the project could be anywhere in the U. S. to I want to make sure these resources are there to support my datacenters as they are getting connected to the utilities in those local jurisdictions and can come online at the same time. So very much becoming a more physical market, and one in which it's really important that their partners show up and perform and deliver as expected, because they are the load on the other side of that. So that's a very attractive proposition from our perspective. As it relates to the structured agreements, listen, we were most focused on making sure that we add value for these customers. That could come in a variety of different forms and factors, but our primary focus is being there and delivering for them when they need us. And we'll update you as those structures evolve, but it's really focused around creating value with and for them.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.\nCarly Davenport: Maybe just to start, a lot has obviously changed in the U. S. Election landscape since your last earnings call. So can you just talk us through your latest expectations on potential implications on the IRA and what impact any modification to that legislation might have on your renewable development plans?\nJohn Ketchum: Sure, Carly. I'll go ahead and take that. I start with we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle in the 22 years that I've been at NextEra. And I don't think this time around is any different and I'm going to go through why. And let's not forget that in that time we've invested hundreds of billions of dollars in American Energy Infrastructure across almost every state in the country who are benefiting from those investments. And we invest in American Energy dominance every single day and are the quintessential all the above energy company. And that doesn't change from one election to the next. And I think really helps when we are working with both sides of the aisle. That said, let's look at where the incentive money is going. The incentives favor republican states, and we've seen an increase in the number of republican lawmakers that are embracing the clean energy credits within the IRA as they see the positive impact to their states and communities, which is hard to turn away from. And the tax laws are very difficult to overturn. And we're very likely to have thin margins in the House and the Senate particularly in light of some of the recent developments. And let's not forget the important role that renewables play and I made some remarks about that in my script today. But renewables create jobs, they create a property tax base that transforms rural communities. Renewables are energy independence, it's electricity generated from the sun and the wind, it's not subject to fuel price volatility. Low cost renewables are also bringing power bills down which attract new investment from data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturers and other sectors that are looking to invest in the U.S., and low power bills can really dictate which states they select to make those investments in. And tariffs are going to further drive investment in the U.S., and with industrial growth across sectors, some of that driven by tariffs, power demand is only going to go up from here. And our country is going to need low cost, fast deploy electricity more than ever. And renewables are the quickest to market and the lowest cost option in almost every state. Otherwise, we're going to slow down and curtail economic growth in our own country and the credits all flow directly to customers in the form of lower power prices. So when you look at all that, why would you cut credits that are creating jobs, create a much needed property tax base in rural America, that flow to customers that result in lower power prices, that attract new investments, and that provide much needed faster deploy resource at a time when demand is accelerated. It just wouldn't make sense. And for all these reasons, we expect the credits to remain in place, the wind, the solar, the battery storage. So all in all, while we would expect the heated rhetoric through the fall campaign, we feel good about where things stand. Again, we have a long history of constructive engagement with both sides of the aisle.\nCarly Davenport: Awesome. Appreciate all of that color. It's really helpful. The follow-up was just on the backlog. Wind saw a bit of an acceleration this quarter from being a bit weaker in the last several. Anything in particular you'd point to in sort of driving that? And do you think that's a potential sign of an inflection on the wind demand side?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hi, Carly, it's Rebecca. We were very pleased to add these projects to the backlog and excited about the partnership with the customers with whom we're going to contract them. I wouldn't necessarily draw any additional lines as kind of consistent with the prior comments I made around backlog. Things are going to be lumpy over time. It's terrific that we were able to add some additional wind projects to the backlog. And right now, our expectations remain consistent with what we laid out last month and obviously have again in our presentation materials today in terms of the targets over the next four years. But I did say as part of our comments last month, I am optimistic, hopeful maybe, that as we look back after this four year period, that is potentially the area where we may have been too conservative and maybe on the lower side of it. It is early in the cycle to make that conclusion, but we strongly believe that wind, solar and battery storage as complementary technologies and low cost and fast to deploy, as John just highlighted, are immensely valuable to our customers. And so having the availability of all three, we think will continue to create value for our customer base over a long period of time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Deutsche Bank.\nAndrew Weisel: Hi, good morning everyone. Just a quick one to clarify please. If I heard you right, I think you said you have 7 gigawatts in total with tech and data center customers. Can you just give us a sense of the pace maybe roughly round numbers how many megawatts per year you've been adding or expect to add? And then if you could also just clarify, is that purely in terms of wind solar storage or does that also include transmission?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hi, Andrew, it's Rebecca. So that is just projects with technology companies, Roughly 3 gigawatts of those are already in service and roughly 4 gigawatts now are the ones that are in the backlog that we plan to build over the coming years. It is a mix of technologies, probably trend wise, fairly consistent with what we have seen for overall trends for renewables development. So projects that are already in service are likely to be more heavily weighted towards wind as we've entered into those relationships over a longer period of time. And then in terms of the backlog, for now, they're more weighted towards solar and storage, but I expect that to even out over time, particularly as these products get more deliberately balanced with new data center demand as these hyperscalers and datacenter operators are starting to put projects in service. So broadly speaking, roughly consistent with overall development trends, And we certainly are seeing a lot of demand, both directly with them as well as in kind of these three way collaborations the utilities that ultimately will need to serve them as they are. And we'll continue to be adding these new data centers and bringing them on themselves.\nAndrew Weisel: Do you see much of an opportunity on the transmission side working with data centers or is your focus more on what you were describing?\nRebecca Kujawa: I would say from a transmission perspective, all of this demand, whether it was the historical replacement cycle demand and now further accelerated by the growth demand, particularly as it gets served with renewables and storage, it is incredibly important that new transmission get built in order to be able to get the resources from which they're most optimally generated to where they're most optimally consumed, and that's changing a little bit. But what's not changing is the need to build transmission. We see interest from the hyperscalers and the datacenter operators to understand transmission and be supportive of it getting built. But it is a very technically complex and you need to understand transmission and how to interact with the system operators and the transmission owners and operators themselves. So I don't see them necessarily wanting to build transmission, but they are very interested in having us and others ensure that it gets built to support their own long term objective.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Really, really appreciate you taking the time and answering my questions here. Just all my other questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up on Carly's questions on election and potential repeal of either risks. How much of that you had a really strong quarter on renewable origination, but how much of that political instability is actually impacting your ability to sign contracts? Is that -- does that come up in your negotiations? Is that keeping your customers away from signing contracts into the future? Any color on that is appreciated.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, Durgesh, the short answer is absolutely not. If anything and if they really did believe that there were going to be modifications that only accelerate demand which is certainly not something that we believe for the reasons I went through but it's not curtailing demand at all.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, Julian. We couldn't be more excited about the origination, not only that we've been able to produce over the last couple of years, each of them being a record in their own right and then the first two quarters being each of them, ironically, the second best quarter, obviously, this quarter topping last quarter that we've ever had. I'll caveat it that origination can be a little bit lumpy. I've consistently said that in quarters where it's a little bit lower than where we are today. And I think I even said it the day that we set the top quarterly additions a couple of quarters ago. So there's always a little bit of bumpiness in there, but what we continue to see is consistent with the comments that we all made at the Investor Conference just last month, that and John talked about in his opening remarks today that the combination of the replacement cycle and the growth cycle is a tremendously positive outlook for us over the very long-term. Some of this is going to take a little bit longer to materialize on the growth side, as we also highlighted last month. As you'll see some of those stronger additions of the 3 gigawatts that we added to our backlog, particularly notably strong in years '26 and '27, and even some megawatts added to '28 and beyond. But overall, what we see today and the execution of our team and the value proposition that we bring to our customers is a very bright outlook. Excellent. Thanks, Jeremy. Appreciate the conversation and question. We've continued to see very strong returns with respect to what we think we need in order to be highly confident that we're adding shareholder value, and I would think about the returns that we laid out at the Investor Conferences is almost minimum thresholds that we have at this point. And there are opportunities, where there's significant customer demand. We have unique positioning in the marketplace to make sure that we get even more attractive returns. I'd say it's a very positive dynamic. It was a very difficult market over the last couple of years when we were seeing the supply chain disruption and increasing pricing, both on the capital equipment side and the ROE side and our returns. And fortunately, we've either seen slightly declining or at a minimum stable backdrop, which is certainly helpful for decreasing our risk and also providing an attractive price and attractive product to our customers. So between the attractive price, the speed to market, the clean attribute of renewables and storage as well as the fact as we talked about last month in the queue across the United States today, all of the projects that are looking to be connected, 90% of those megawatts are renewables and storage, and we have a healthy portion of those. And I couldn't be more excited about our position. So I think we're in a great shape to continue to add a lot of shareholder value in the many years ahead. Hi David, it's Rebecca, I'll chime in here. We certainly are hearing from our power sector customers a lot of interest, from various data center customers, whether the data center operators or the hyperscalers. It is a little bit challenging to see how much of that is potentially multiple requests for ultimately the same data center, but there is no escaping the fact that these are very large numbers and things that numbers that I don't think any utility across the industry has seen before. And so it's going to take some time not only to rationalize that and figure out how you address it, but also to procure and bring online the megawatts and the transmission over the long term that is going to be required to serve this demand if it ends up being as strong as we see it and we think it might be. From our perspective, consistent with our comments from last month, we are seeing a lot of interest both from the power sector customers as well as hyperscalers and data center customers. You're clearly seeing some of that show up in our origination, but you're also seeing some of that more of that show up in this '26 and '27 timeframe and now even '28 as we are lining up these projects to support when they will come online for our utility customers. So I think we all are very excited. It is very interesting for our sector to see this growth that we haven't seen in a couple of decades. But I do think from a practical standpoint, it's going to take a couple of years for this really to materialize and utilities to be able to absorb it and serve it. But that's a terrific backdrop for us. Some of these challenges are going to be difficult to solve, and I believe there's no better company to partner with our customers to help solve them. Sure. Well, David, I'll answer it more broadly than just specific to one certainly for a variety of reasons, including sensitivities. Some of these comments would otherwise be sent for them for their own competitive positioning. But those specifically were new contracts, and they were to support data center demand wind, solar and battery storage. And then more broadly speaking from a hyperscalars perspective, they are interested in a variety of technologies, wind solar and battery storage. And they I would say probably the biggest change for many of them is a shift or certainly an increasing percentage of these projects that are very specifically associated with the data centers that these hyperscalars are trying to build. So it's less interest in just a pure virtual power purchase agreement where the project could be anywhere in the U. S. to I want to make sure these resources are there to support my datacenters as they are getting connected to the utilities in those local jurisdictions and can come online at the same time. So very much becoming a more physical market, and one in which it's really important that their partners show up and perform and deliver as expected, because they are the load on the other side of that. So that's a very attractive proposition from our perspective. As it relates to the structured agreements, listen, we were most focused on making sure that we add value for these customers. That could come in a variety of different forms and factors, but our primary focus is being there and delivering for them when they need us. And we'll update you as those structures evolve, but it's really focused around creating value with and for them. Hi, Carly, it's Rebecca. We were very pleased to add these projects to the backlog and excited about the partnership with the customers with whom we're going to contract them. I wouldn't necessarily draw any additional lines as kind of consistent with the prior comments I made around backlog. Things are going to be lumpy over time.

            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2024, FPL increased earnings per share by $0.03 year-over-year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 10.7% year-over-year. We continue to expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.1 billion for the quarter, and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $8 billion $8.8 billion. Over the current four year settlement agreement, we expect FPL's capital investments to exceed $3 billion, $4 billion. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 3.7% from the prior year comparable period due to warmer weather, which had a positive year-over-year impact on usage for costumer of approximately 2.6%. As a result FPL grew retail sales in second quarter by roughly 1.1% on a weather normalized basis. For the 12 months ending June 2024, FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8% and the 11.4% regulatory ROE mentioned previously is expected to be realized in the fourth quarter for the 12-months ending December 2024. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 10.8% per year -- at 10.8% year-over-year and Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.03 year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily driven by continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio increased $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting an increase in wind resources during the quarter. Wind resource for the Q2 of 2024 was approximately 104% of the long term average versus 88% in the second quarter of 2023. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business, which you'll recall had strong earnings last year, decreased by $0.03 per share. Contributions from our gas infrastructure business decreased by $0.07 per share, due to a combination of higher depletion expense related to lower production estimates, certain non-recurring items and the sale of the Texas pipelines by NextEra Energy Partners. While we may see a few pennies impact again next quarter, we expect gas infrastructure's earnings growth to be effectively flat going forward as we continue to allocate more capital on a relative basis to renewables, storage and transmission. Similar to what we saw this quarter, the increased contributions from new investment driven by the strength of our renewable development program are expected to more than offset any slowing in gas infrastructure growth going forward. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. Energy resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding 3,000 megawatts to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 22.6 gigawatts after taking into account more than 1,600 megawatts of new projects placed in the service since our last earnings call, providing great visibility into energy resources ability to deliver on our development program expectations which we recently extended at our Investor Conference. We expect the backlog additions will go into service over the next few years and into 2028. Energy resources 300 gigawatt pipeline is years in the making and ready to respond to customer demand. We have competitive advantages understanding transmission and grid constraints. We have strong relationships with utilities serving the growing power grid. We can build system solutions across stakeholders and customer needs, and we can leverage our proprietary technology to site and deploy the best projects for our customers. A great example is our collaboration with Entergy, where we are targeting to build 4.5 gigawatts of renewable storage solutions to help them meet both their new increased load demand and energy transition goals. And we couldn't be more excited to work with a long-term established customer in order to help them execute on these goals. Another example is our collaboration with Google. As John said earlier, this quarter's backlog addition include 860 megawatts signed with Google to support their data center needs. That brings our total renewables portfolio with technology and data center customers, including assets in operation and in backlog to 7 gigawatts. Our competitive position is even further advantaged by our existing portfolio, with interconnection timelines for new sites stretching for three to seven years or beyond. We can dramatically improve our speed to market by utilizing the existing interconnection from our operating footprint to deploy co-located solar and storage, as well as execute on wind and potentially solar repowers. This optionality provides a unique resource to meet our customer needs, while also capitalizing on the embedded option value from the existing portfolio. Beyond renewables and storage, we're excited to say that Mountain Valley Pipeline is now in service. Turning now to Q2 2024 consolidated results. Adjusted earnings from corporate and other increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year. During the quarter, NextEra issued $2 billion of equity units and recently Energy Resources entered into an agreement with Blackstone to sell a partial interest in a portfolio of wind and solar projects for approximately $900 million. Our long-term financial expectations, which we stated last month at our Investor Conference, remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we're not able to deliver financial results at or near the top-end of our adjusted EPS expectations range in 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. From 2023 to 2027, we continue to expect that our average annual growth and operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And we also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% per year through at least \u201826 off of 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveats. Turning next to NextEra Energy Partners. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners' board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.95 per common unit or $3.62 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 6% from a year earlier. Turning to the balance sheet, since our last earnings call, the partnership completed the next net renewables to equity buyout of roughly $190 million in June 2024 and paid down our 2024 convertible maturity with cash on hand. After repayment of a $700 million HoldCo debt maturity earlier this month, the partnership now has approximately $2.7 billion of liquidity. Let me now turn to the detailed results. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $560 million and cash available for distribution was $220 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 780 net megawatts of new assets that either closed in the Q2 of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023 contributed approximately $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $9 million of cash available for distribution. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects grew by approximately $62 million year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable wind resource during the quarter and partially offset by lower solar generation. Wind resources approximately 103% of the long term average versus 88% in the second of 2023. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $46 million and $43 million respectively, from the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio, which is partially offset by the interest benefit of the remaining cash proceeds received from the sale of these assets. From a base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $3.52. The partnership continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit with the current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable product range of expectations through at least 2026. NextEra Energy Partners expects the partner's payout ratio to be in the mid to high 90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. In terms of next steps for NextEra Energy Partners, as we have discussed with you previously, the partnership is continuing to look at all options to secure a competitive cost of capital and to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing buyouts. At the same time, the partnership's 6% distribution growth target remains for now. NextEra Energy Partners does not need an acquisition related financing in 2024 to meet its 6% target and does not need gross equity until 2027. NextEra Energy Partners owns a large portfolio of high quality long term contracted clean energy assets and the partnership has attractive organic growth from the repowering of its existing portfolio. We expect to share more in the coming quarters as we address these objectives. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million respectively. As a reminder, year-end 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year-end 2024. As a further reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveats. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we'll open the line for questions. Hey, thanks, Shah. Obviously, NEP is getting a lot of our attention in terms of looking at what the alternatives are to both improve the cost of capital, which really requires us to be able to successfully address the back end [SEPFs]. And as we said in the prepared remarks, all options are on the table. And what we really are spending time on and we are looking at various solutions around this is how do you tackle those back end setups in a constructive way that makes sense in terms of the cost of capital that would be required to do that and then how do we put NEP in a better position for success going forward. So as part of that, we are obviously exploring all alternatives. We've mentioned private capital as one potential avenue there as well. The good thing is that we have time. We have time in 2024. We've said in the market, we don't have to do anything, we don't have a drops plan for '24, don't have growth equity needs until '27. And so we are being thoughtful about our approach around NEP. Yes. Sure. I don't want to put a firm deadline on it. But I think the language we use is over the next few quarters and once we have identified a solution that we think makes sense then obviously we will share that but not until then. So here's how I think about supply chain. These are number one, there is been some attention around AD/CVD filing and tariffs and those things. We're not impacted. And I made the comment and we spent a lot of time with this both in March and then at our Investor Conference in June still matters more than ever in this business. So the way I would think about it from an investor perspective is the bigger our program, the more leverage we have over our supplier. And in the last couple of years, we have really spent a lot of time and made investment around the data and analytical capability that we have around our supply chain. And we have also made a very conscientious effort around risk transfer and making sure that we have adequate securities to provide incentive to perform. So we are in a position where we have really been able to transfer any tariff for AD/CVD or related risks over to our suppliers. Why is that? The reason for that is when putting numbers up like 3 gigawatts a quarter and have the type of build that we have and expect to have going forward. The contractors and vendors want to work with us. And they've also seen a lot of small developers that ultimately haven't been able to arrange financing or for whatever reason haven't had terrific follow through on their projects. That's not the case with our company. And so there's been even a greater emphasis I would say by our suppliers who want to work with us more than ever. But what that means is making sure that we are always left in a position where we are not taking risks around the obvious things that you might put on your list. And so I really feel better than ever about where we stand from a supply chain perspective and I am very happy with the job that our team has done and the lessons that we've learned over the last couple of years have all been folded into how we contractually approach risk in our agreements going forward."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong increasing more than 9% year-over-year. In addition, through the first six months of the year, our adjusted earnings per share has increased 9.4% year-over-year. The continued strong financial and operational performance at both FPL and Energy Resources position our company well to meet its overall objectives for the year. At FPL, we have continued to deliver for our customers on multiple fronts since the start of our most recent rate settlement in 2022. We are making smart capital investments in low cost solar generation and battery storage. We're continuing to reduce our overall fuel cost and combined with generation modernizations have saved customers nearly $16 billion since 2001. We are delivering best in class non-fuel O&M where we're 70% better than the national average, saving our customers $3 billion every year compared to the average utility. A big driver of our outperformance has been our team and culture of continuous improvement and productivity. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than through our annual companywide initiative to reimagine everything that we do, which we call Project Velocity. This year, we identified record $460 million of run rate cost savings opportunities through 2027, part of which benefit FPL and its customers. By finding opportunities to take cost out of the business and making smart capital investments to reduce its fuel costs, FPL has kept residential bills nearly 40% below the national average and by far the lowest among all the Florida investor owned utilities. FPL's reliability also ranks among the best in the industry, where we are 66% better than the national average in the number of minutes a customer's power is interrupted per year. I'm most proud of the fact we continue to deliver on our customer value proposition during a period of unprecedented growth in Florida. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the U. S. with roughly 1,000 people moving to Florida every day. And it's not just the residential sector. We're seeing the commercial and industrial sector growing too. As a result of this accelerated growth, FPL's regulatory capital employed has grown at a 12% compound annual growth rate since the beginning of 2022 compared against an estimated 9% comp in annual growth rate that was originally anticipated for the four year settlement period. We have shouldered this additional growth through our reserve amortization mechanism, which enables FPL to absorb the cost for these capital investments without increasing customer bills in the interim. While these efforts have helped us to meet customer growth and deliver for our Florida customers, our reserve amortization mechanism has been utilized faster than expected. FPL fully expects to seek recovery of these increased expenditures in its rate case filing next year. FPL ended the second quarter with a remaining reserve amortization balance of $586 million which is expected to be sufficient to support FPL's capital investment plan and its ability to earn an 11.4% regulatory ROE this year and next. An 11.4% percent regulatory ROE is expected to have a $0.06 EPS impact in each of 2024 and 2025, which has already been taken into account in our financial expectations, and we will be disappointed if we are unable to deliver financial results at or near the top of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges each year through 2027 at NextEra Energy. We expect to continue to demonstrate the benefits and protections that the reserve amortization mechanism provides customers when we file our rate case next year. Our vision is for FPL to be the best utility franchise in the country by doubling down on what we do best, delivering low bills and high reliability for our customers by making smart capital investments and being an industry leader on costs. These attributes are important to our customers and regulators, and they are important to us. We look forward to continuing to deliver on what we believe is an outstanding customer value proposition at FPL. Growth is not only occurring inside Florida, but outside Florida as well. At Energy Resources, we are benefiting from two types of demand, replacement cycle and gross cycle demand. With regard to the former, we have long been a beneficiary of a replacement cycle where higher cost, less efficient generation has been retired in favor of low cost renewables and battery storage. We expect this to continue and while replacement cycle demand has been around for a long time, growth cycle demand is new. With the exception of a few states such as Florida, power demand from new growth has been static in our industry for decades. That's changing as power demand is projected to grow 4x faster over the next 2 decades compared to the prior two. That growth is being driven by demand across multiple sectors, which is expected to create a long term opportunity for faster deploy low cost generation. As highlighted at our investor conference, we expect the demand for new renewables to triple over the next seven years versus the prior seven to help meet this increased power demand. Energy Resources couldn't be better positioned as it has a 300 gigawatt pipeline, half of which is in the interconnection queue process or is already interconnection ready. Our scaled experience and technology coupled with our ability to build new transmission where required enable us to meet the growing demands of our power and commercial and industrial customer base. Underpinning these competitive advantages are our decades of data, analytical capabilities and experience with system operators and relationships with utilities that position us well to get the power to where it needs to go. Our continued ability to drive origination results speaks for itself. Energy Resources added over 3,000 megawatts of new renewables and storage projects for the backlog this quarter, 860 megawatts of which come from agreements with Google to meet their data center power demand. This marks our second best origination quarter ever. These results support our belief that the bulk of the growth demand will be met by a combination of new renewables and battery storage. The importance of renewable and storage to help meet our economies growing demand for power has never been more evident. As data center growth accelerates to facilitate our economy shift to artificial intelligence, and as we continue to re-domesticate and electrify across multiple sectors, our nation must embrace an all of the above strategy to meet increasing electric demand. Renewables and storage are energy independent as they rely on American wind and sunshine. They also are extremely fast to deploy compared to alternative forms of generation making them vital to our country's success going forward. And importantly, the country has stood up a significant domestic industry to support their growth, which is driving investment in factories and is creating good paying jobs and a tax base that is revitalizing rural communities across America. As customers increasingly demand smart clean energy solutions, we are the company with experience in every part of the energy value chain and are uniquely positioned to help them make the right decisions for their business. As the owner and operator of a large natural gas-fired fleet in Florida, we are also conscious of the importance of natural gas-fired generation as a bridge fuel. Yet, we also are well aware of the realities of new build gas-fired generation. It's more expensive in most states, is subject to fuel price volatility and takes considerable time given the need to get gas delivered generating unit and the three to four year waiting period for gas turbines. Low cost, fast to deploy renewables help keep power prices down, making our economy more competitive globally. Ultimately, our country needs all forms of energy as we move forward and the future has never been brighter for the power generation sector as a whole and renewables in particular. As I've been saying, NextEra Energy was built for this moment and our future outlook has never been stronger. Our strategic focus is to deliver low cost clean energy and storage for customers both inside and outside Florida, while building new transmission where required to support new generation. We have the playbook and the platform to win in any environment and most importantly, we have the team. Our competitive advantages continue to grow every day, providing industry differentiation that is over two decades in the making and difficult to replicate. And I firmly believe, we will continue to expand that strategic distance, creating value for customers and shareholders. Nobody is better positioned to meet the demands of the energy customer of tomorrow than NextEra Energy. And I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian to cover the detailed results beginning with FPL. Yeah. No, absolutely, Steve. So we've had a lot of population growth in Florida, a lot of that has impacted our service territory. When we first entered in the settlement agreement, back in '21, we've got our regulatory capital employed to be around 9%. It's actually been around 12% as we have accommodated that growth. And so we've got surplus that's right around $586 million today as we look forward for this year and next based on where we are, the capital plans that we have for the FPL business, which are still very strong to take into account the further growth that we see. We believe that with that amortization balance and those CapEx plans will probably be right around an 11.4% ROE for the full year '24 and for the full year \u201825. And that has about a $0.06 impact here this year and a $0.06 impact next year. It's already folded into our financial expectations and not a concern in terms of our ability to cover it. And a big plus from the Steve is, it really I think is a good fact heading into a refiling in 2025 because it demonstrates how the surplus mechanism can really help customers. And the last point that I'll make is don't forget these additional capital investments that we've made, we would expect to see full recovery of in our next filing. So this remember that the surplus mechanism is intended really just to deal with the regulatory lag as we make new investments at FPL to accommodate the additional growth. So we're not worried about this. This is something that is something that we feel very comfortable about addressing in our financial expectations and doesn't impact where we feel like we will end up this year and next. Yeah, it was 1.6 gigawatt portfolio just a mix of renewable assets. And I think the real positive takeaway here for investors is there's a real demand for NextEra assets. I mean, we are recognized in the private equity market as being really the top developer. And given all the growth and this quarter is a great example of the 3 gigawatts that we were able to do. We have a strong trajectory going forward. And as private equity has opportunities to work with us and we have a long history of working with private equity going back the last five or six years. It really is a good potential win-win for us and for them. With the Blackstone organization, we really like the capability that they bring to the table and there's a lot of crossover between our two organizations in terms of what we do. And so this was a good fit for us. They invested capital alongside us. And so they have a partial interest in that portfolio of 1.6 gigawatts. Yes, for us, I mean, look, first I'll start with the fact that we are a top tensile operator of wind. I think really recognized as the best operator of wind in the business. And we have a real partnership with GE, and so, look, wind turbines have moving parts, they'll have issues from time to time. But our partnership with GE runs 20 years and so we've really never had issues in getting things and we're always able to structure win-win arrangements with them. So as any problems arise to the portfolio they've always been well managed and addressed in a conciliatory way with GE and future. Yes. No, good question, Julien. So from a recycling standpoint, feel better than I ever have in terms of the options that we have going forward for the portfolio. In terms of asset mix and how we think about that, obviously, we've always had a history of being able to recycle capital around renewables, which are terrific assets which I think we have a great reputation in the market around and our ability to attract capital on the renewable portfolio. But look, we are also making a conscientious effort and I think I made these comments at the Investor Conference that we're looking at our core business, right. Our core business is wind, it's solar, it's battery storage, it's transmission both inside Florida, outside of Florida. And so to the extent we can do some targeted capital recycling around our gas infrastructure business that will continue to be top of mind. Transmission, you raised as well. We are having a lot of success in transmission and the team has done a terrific job I think on the competitive transmission side of identifying new opportunities, and just based on the return structure that we could target, there's good sense to bring in a partner on some of those deals. And so those have been opportunities that we have been targeting as well as we think about the future. But obviously it puts us in a position where we continue to manage those assets and those opportunities as we think about how they contribute to the future. But those certainly are 2 things that we look at in addition to the renewable portfolio. And the numbers that we gave at the Investor Conference, I certainly don't lose any sleepover in terms of the ability to meet those capital recycling targets. From a business mix perspective, I think which is your last question, you know and I think most folks on the phone know that we are very rigorous about looking at our five year forecast and even go beyond that. And so we're constantly looking at our mix and what our obligations are and undertakings are with the agencies and we have a lot of headroom, a lot of headroom on our business mix. So that is not an issue, that is not a concern and the capital recycling plan I think fits well with what our undertakings are there, but plenty ahead of room on business mix. Absolutely. I'm going to turn that one over to Rebecca. Sure. First of all, as you know, we are always looking to manage risk around our capital investment decisions. And one of those risks is it's not only locking in equipment cost, it's not only locking in labor, but it's also locking in our cost of capital. So as we approach our renewable portfolio, we've been very mindful of making sure that we are locking in our cost of capital through interest rate hedge products swaps in that regard. As I think about the future and the rate the one, the two rate cuts, who knows where we ultimately end up on those fronts. Obviously given the financing plans that we have moving forward, those would be tailwinds for the business. But at the same time, if those don't materialize, we have already taken those into account in our financial expectations and we're very prudent and on top of managing the risk the interest rate risk exposure that we have across the business. Sure. Thanks, Nick, for that question on nuclear. With regard to Duane Arnold, I think there would be opportunities and a lot of demand from the market if we were able to do something with Duane Arnold. Obviously bringing back a nuclear plant is into service is not something that you can do without a lot of thought. And it is something that we are looking at, but there is a lot of thought that has to go into it and obviously a real assessment around risks associated with that as well. And so sure, we're looking at it, but we would only do it if we could do it in a way that is essentially risk free with plenty of mitigants around the approach and there are a few things that we would have to work through. But yes, we are looking at it. Sure, Carly. I'll go ahead and take that. I start with we've always been able to work with both sides of the aisle in the 22 years that I've been at NextEra. And I don't think this time around is any different and I'm going to go through why. And let's not forget that in that time we've invested hundreds of billions of dollars in American Energy Infrastructure across almost every state in the country who are benefiting from those investments. And we invest in American Energy dominance every single day and are the quintessential all the above energy company. And that doesn't change from one election to the next. And I think really helps when we are working with both sides of the aisle. That said, let's look at where the incentive money is going. The incentives favor republican states, and we've seen an increase in the number of republican lawmakers that are embracing the clean energy credits within the IRA as they see the positive impact to their states and communities, which is hard to turn away from. And the tax laws are very difficult to overturn. And we're very likely to have thin margins in the House and the Senate particularly in light of some of the recent developments. And let's not forget the important role that renewables play and I made some remarks about that in my script today. But renewables create jobs, they create a property tax base that transforms rural communities. Renewables are energy independence, it's electricity generated from the sun and the wind, it's not subject to fuel price volatility. Low cost renewables are also bringing power bills down which attract new investment from data centers, semiconductor chip manufacturers and other sectors that are looking to invest in the U.S., and low power bills can really dictate which states they select to make those investments in. And tariffs are going to further drive investment in the U.S., and with industrial growth across sectors, some of that driven by tariffs, power demand is only going to go up from here. And our country is going to need low cost, fast deploy electricity more than ever. And renewables are the quickest to market and the lowest cost option in almost every state. Otherwise, we're going to slow down and curtail economic growth in our own country and the credits all flow directly to customers in the form of lower power prices. So when you look at all that, why would you cut credits that are creating jobs, create a much needed property tax base in rural America, that flow to customers that result in lower power prices, that attract new investments, and that provide much needed faster deploy resource at a time when demand is accelerated. It just wouldn't make sense. And for all these reasons, we expect the credits to remain in place, the wind, the solar, the battery storage. So all in all, while we would expect the heated rhetoric through the fall campaign, we feel good about where things stand. Again, we have a long history of constructive engagement with both sides of the aisle. Yes, Durgesh, the short answer is absolutely not. If anything and if they really did believe that there were going to be modifications that only accelerate demand which is certainly not something that we believe for the reasons I went through but it's not curtailing demand at all."

NextEra Energy has strong first quarter results growing adjusted earnings per share by 8.3% year-over-year. Based on FPL and energy resources, financial and operational performance, we are once again off to a solid start for the year. In addition, FPL placed into service 1640 MW of new solar, while Energy Resources added 2765 MW of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. This quarter marks Energy Resources second best origination quarter ever, as well as its best solar and best storage origination quarter. As we highlighted at our March Renewables Development Day, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned for the expected strong power demand growth through the end of the decade and beyond. After years of relatively flat U.S. power growth, numerous reports now highlight significant future low growth being driven across industries such as oil and gas, manufacturing and technology. The re-domestication of industry to U.S., supported by public policy, will drive the need for more electricity and the tech industry is going to need data centers to support the expected cloud capacity demands that come with artificial intelligence applications. Of course, increased load demand will not come all at once and will take some time to materialize, but it is clear that many new customers are concerned about power availability to meet their plans and consider power supply as a significant obstacle to business expansion. We believe renewables and storage are a key enabler to help meet this increased demand. In fact, we believe the U.S. renewables and storage market opportunity has the potential to be 3x bigger over the next seven years compared to the last seven, growing from roughly 140 gigawatts of additions to approximately 375 to 450 gigawatts. And we believe no one is better positioned to address these power supply challenges and capitalize on this demand than NextEra Energy. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables, storage and transmission for the benefit of customers, while also providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. Our enterprise-wide scale decades of experience and technology investments are key competitive advantages that allow us to drive value and meet this expected power demand. Scale is one of our key differentiators, and it matters more than ever. Scale allows us to buy and build with better pricing, better protections, and better positioning to navigate disruption. Scale provides access to capital and cost of capital advantages, allowing us to leverage one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships to finance projects at beneficial terms. Scale has driven top decile operational performance throughout our generation fleet. Today, NextEra Energy's roughly 74 gigawatt operating fleet, comprised of 35 gigawatts at FPL and 39 gigawatts at Energy Resources, provide significant operational scale. As FPL continues its solar and storage build out and Energy Resources brings new renewables and storage projects online for customers, the operating fleet could grow to over 100 gigawatts by the end of 2026. This would further extend our scale advantages and create value for customers and shareholders. Our scale has enabled greater supply chain diversification and flexibility. And the good news is the solar supply chain has much improved from two years ago. Inflationary pressures are alleviating and manufacturing capacity is significantly expanding. In the U.S. manufacturing incentives are expected to support increases in domestic module manufacturing capacity to over 50 gigawatts by 2026 from just under 8 gigawatts at the end of 2021. We have greater supplier diversity and flexibility than ever before, strengthening our ability to bring low cost solar to American consumers and businesses. Our decades of experience is another key competitive advantage. Our experience allows us to navigate power demand challenges, delivering cost effective, reliable generation for our growing FPL customer base and designing clean energy solutions to help our Energy Resources customers. We understand every part of the energy value chain with deep expertise in all technologies, the power markets and transmission. Our team embraces continuous improvement that drives innovation. We recognized the changing landscape and secured land interconnects and transmission equipment years in advance. Technology is the next frontier for the power industry, and we believe our two-decade head start on the rest of the industry is a significant competitive advantage. Today, NextEra Energy captures 560 billion operational data points each day and has dozens of proprietary artificial intelligence tools to drive analytical, real-time decision making. We use these tools to analyze over 100 attributes of our own data to secure and develop the best sites in Florida and across the country. We use our tools to iterate millions of site layout designs based on proprietary resource data and assessments to maximize value, and we use our tools to operate nearly all our renewable storage and fossil generation fleets around the clock from our headquarters in South Florida. We are leveraging this combination of enterprise-wide scale, decades of experience and investment in technology to better position both businesses to capitalize on what we believe will be years of demand to drive long-term value for customers and shareholders. Today, electricity represents just 20% of overall U.S. energy consumption, and wind and solar generation represents only 16% of the U.S. electricity mix. In short, we believe the U.S. will need a significant and growing amount of electricity over the next decade and beyond, a large part of which will be powered by new renewables and storage. At FPL as more people move into Florida, we are focused on extending the customer value proposition by keeping our bills as low as possible and delivering clean, affordable energy by investing in solar, battery storage and transmission. At Energy Resources, our business is focusing on building low cost wind, solar, battery storage, and transmission. We are using our data and proprietary technology to help power customers balance supply and demand while keeping customer bills affordable. We also use our tools with commercial and industrial customers to identify the best locations based on their physical preferences and most important variables. For both power and commercial and industrial customers we leverage our 300 gigawatt development pipeline and transmission and market expertise to help design the lowest cost clean energy solutions. Both businesses complement each other, deepen our skill sets and advantages, and foster innovation and we leverage our greatest asset, our people, who have decades of experience to drive value for our customers and shareholders. When I consider current energy demands, the long-term electricity needs, and our competitive advantages, I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. I look forward to telling more of our story and explaining why NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to lead the electrification of the U.S. economy at our Investor Day on June 11 in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk to cover the quarterly results.\nKirk Crews: Thank you, John. For the first quarter of 2024, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year over year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.5% year-over-year. We now expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $7.8 billion and $8.8 billion. For the twelve months ending March 2024 FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the first quarter, we utilized approximately $572 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $651 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this month, FPL received approval to reduce customer bills due to projected 2024 fuel savings. As a result, FPL's typical 1000 kilowatt hour residential customer bill is expected to be roughly $14 lower in May than the start of the year and approximately 37% lower than the current national average. Over the current four-year settlement agreement we now expect FPL's capital investments to be slightly above our previous range of $32 billion to $34 billion. This quarter FPL placed into service 1640 MW of new cost effective solar, putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at over 6400 MW, which is the largest utility owned solar portfolio in the country. FPL's annual ten-year site plan continues to indicate that solar and storage are the most cost effective answer for customers to add reliable grid capacity over the next decade. The 2024 plan includes similar levels of new solar generation capacity 21 gigawatts across our service territory over the next ten years compared to our 2023 plan. But our 2024 plan doubles the expected deployment of battery storage to over 4 gigawatts, some of which we expect to be needed earlier than forecasted in our 2023 plan. With this plan, we expect to increase FPL solar mix from approximately 6% of our total generation in 2023% to 38% in 2033 while continuing to provide customers with clean, affordable energy. FPL believes battery storage will play an increasingly valuable role for customers, serving as an attractive capacity complement to our growing solar generation. From providing system balancing needs in critical parts of FPL's service territory to supplying energy during any time of day or weather condition, battery storage acts as a key resource to the system that is both valuable and cost effective for customers. Key indicators show that Florida's economy remains healthy. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the nation and had four of the five fastest growing U.S. metro areas between 2022 and 2023. FPL had its strongest quarter of customer growth in over 15 years, with the average number of customers increasing by more than 100,000 from the comparable prior year period. Although FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased by approximately 1.3% year-over-year, we estimate that weather had a negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. After taking weather into account, first quarter retail sales increased roughly 4.1% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued favorable underlying population growth and usage per customer. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 13.1% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the quarter. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business increased results by $0.04 per share. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.07 per share, half of which related to new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2765 to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 21.5 gigawatts after taking into account 1165 MW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, highlighting Energy Resources ability to continue to identify attractive and accretive investment opportunities which provide strong growth visibility in the years ahead. We recently plugged 740 MW of new solar and storage projects into service which are being used to support data centers located in Arizona and New Mexico. Both of these projects are now one of the largest battery storage facilities in their respective states and in combination with their co-located solar each project enabled the local utility to serve their customers need for new, reliable, clean energy to grow their own business operations. We are proud to continue to support our power and commercial and industrial customers to meet their growing power and capacity needs create jobs and provide economic development in these local communities. Our origination activities across our power and commercial and industrial customers are beginning to reflect the rising power demand. We are seeing it manifest with our power customers in their state RFP processes and bilateral discussions where we deliver cost effective renewables and storage to their grid. We are also observing it through interactions with our oil and gas and manufacturing customers where we utilize our data and technology to help them make better siting decisions. Our technology customers have been a consistent driver of demand for many years, reflected by our roughly 3 gigawatt operating portfolio and over 3 gigawatt project backlog as we partner with them to provide various clean energy solutions based on their key business variables. We are a partner with both our power and commercial industrial customers trust. We leverage our 3 gigawatt development pipeline, our 35 gigawatt operating renewables and storage portfolio, and our transformer and switchgear procurement covering energy resources billed through 2027 to deliver projects for customers. As John said, the power demand growth is expected to be strong through at least the end of the decade. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for new renewables and storage origination. This is on the heels of two consecutive record origination years at Energy Resources. We continue to expect to remain on track for our overall renewables development expectations of roughly 33 to 42 gigawatts from 2023 through 2026. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmissions was recently selected by the California ISO to develop a new a two-mile, 500 kV transmission line in Southern California, with a capital investment of more than $250 million. We believe this project could unlock over 3 gigawatts of new renewable generation capacity, supporting California's ambitious clean energy goals. This award follows a record year for NextEra Energy Transmission in 2023 and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this growing business. We continue to believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission is a key advantage for our renewables business. Turning now to our first quarter 2024 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to transfer approximately $1 billion of tax credits throughout 2024, representing the bulk of our expected transfers for the year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025 and 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And as we announced in February, the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy approved a targeted growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveat. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnerships transition plan and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. We bought out the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing in 2023 and have sufficient proceeds available from the Texas pipeline portfolio sale to complete the NEP Renewables II buyout due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. With the plan for the near-term convertible equity portfolio financings well understood, we remain focused on the partnership's cost of capital improving, which is critical for its success. With that objective in mind, we continue to evaluate alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. Turning to the partnership's targeted 6% growth in LP distributions per unit, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition this year to achieve its 6% targeted growth rate and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically re-powering of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 100 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 1085 MW of repowers. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 89.25 cents per common unit or $3.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit. Let me now turn to the detailed results. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $462 million and cash available for distribution was $164 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 840 net megawatts of new projects that either closed in the second quarter of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023, contributed approximately $32 million of adjusted EBITDA and $7 million of cash available for distribution. First quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $37 million year-over-year, driven primarily by unfavorable wind resource during the quarter and lower generation at Genesis Solar Project as a result of a planned outage for major maintenance. Wind resource was approximately 97% of long-term average versus 102% in the first quarter of 2023. The incentive distribution right fee suspension provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $44 million and $38 million respectively, for the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio. From a base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnerships payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million respectively. As a reminder, yearend 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. Hi, thank you. Just first question just there's been press reports about potential another AD/CVD case to be filed related to solar panels and Biden also talking about getting rid of the protection on the bifacial panel tariff. Could you just talk a little bit more about how you're positioned to deal with those cases if they do arise? Changes if they arise? Thanks.\nJohn Ketchum: Sure. Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me take those in order. Let me talk about, first of all, the speculation around AD/CVD filing, which, may or may not occur, and then the bifacial exemption. But first on the AD/CVD, the bottom line takeaway for folks is that, we expect that any trade actions that would occur this time around will be very manageable and for several reasons, I'm going to go through them. This is not like circumvention. This is not circumvention 2.0. The solar panel market is in a very different spot. And the first point, I want to make is, we don't expect any trade action, if it were to occur, to result in delivery stoppages. And in any event, our panels are delivered well in advance of construction, which gives us a lot of time and opportunity to be able to troubleshoot any issues should they arise. And why do I think no stoppages are going to occur this time around? The main reason is the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world and so there's a lot of economic reasons for deliveries to continue to occur. The second point, I want to make is that given our scale, we have appropriate incentives and contractual protections that are in place in our agreements with our suppliers to ensure that delivery occurs timely. And we also don't put all of our eggs in one basket. We have a diversified set of suppliers, as you would all expect, and the ability to pivot from one supplier to another should any issues occur. So I feel like in very good spot there. Third point I want to make, and it's one that I hit in my prepared remarks, is that the U.S. and the global supply, supply of solar panels is bigger than ever and it's growing. And let me talk, for example, about the U.S. market, specifically. The U.S. domestic solar panel industry is getting stronger and stronger than it's ever been. One of the points that I made also in the prepared remarks is at the end of 2021, solar panel module capacity in the U.S. was about 8 gigawatts. That's expected to be about 50 gigawatts by the time we get to 2026. So the U.S. market is in a much different spot. There's already been 150 gigawatts of new U.S. solar panel factory announcements that have been made. If you talk to most U.S. domestic solar panel manufacturers, they're sold out through 2026. So they're certainly not having any trouble with demand, which is the other point that I want to make. So now let's speculate a little bit. So if a filing is made around anti-dumping, let me deal with that first. We find it hard to believe that any panels are being dumped into the U.S. market under the law that would be applied. As I said, the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world. It's two to three times higher than any other market in the world. And if panels were being dumped, that could not be the case. So that's the first point I want to make on anti-dumping. The second point I want to make, if there were a countervailing duty claim filed, the Department of Commerce would first have to look in to see if the price of solar modules in Southeast Asian countries, for example, were being subsidized. We don't really have any idea or way of knowing that until we see what gets filed. But, after we see those arguments, we'll be able to make a better assessment. But countervailing duties, historically, I mean, if you look at examples for countervailing duties that have been applied in the past against China suppliers, they've typically been around, 10% to 15%. So even if those were to be applied in this case, quite mean, manageable. And the other point I want to make is that what's different is tariffs in this situation would be prospective and not retroactive. And so for all of these reasons, even if something were to move forward, we still have no way of knowing if it will. We are very well positioned to manage through this, like we always do. Our inventory position and the contractual protections that we have in place are expected to give us strong coverage for our backlog through 2027. And by that time, as more and more U.S. production comes online, as expected, these trade issues will fall away. So that's AD/CVD. Let me just turn quickly to a couple of minor comments on the bifacial exemption. The bottom line, the bifacial exemption, even if it's removed, really has no impact on NextEra. Why is that? We've contracted all of our panel needs through February 26, and we have very minimal exposure to the bifacial exemption being removed. And once that bifacial exemption, even if removed, it would expire at the end of February of 2026, and it can't be brought again and reinstated for another eight years. So we feel like we're in a very good spot. And the last point I'll make is as more and more U.S. production capacity comes online and it's actually available by, we will continue to source from U.S. suppliers. So look, when you put all those things together, feel like this is very manageable and feel like we will be fine.\nSteve Fleishman: That was very thorough and helpful. Thank you, John. And then I guess one other question on the data center. So you talked about the backlog edge you had this quarter. Just as we go into this year and think about this, is this going to continue to be more kind of, one off or two off quarter by quarter updates, or is there should we see more kind of potential for more, like long dated partnerships or kind of larger scale agreements? How should we think about how that might develop?\nJohn Ketchum: I think kind of all of the above, Steve. Our opportunity is significant around data centers is a point, first point that I'll make and I think if you look historically on what we've been able to do with data center customers, I don't think anybody's had better results than we have. If you look at just our gigawatts in operation, we have 3.5 gigawatts in operation today. We have another 3, close to 3.5 gigawatts in our backlog with technology providers. We really understand their business. We really understand what it is they need. And part of that is because we spent a lot of time with them, we do business with all the, what I would call the top five hyperscalers in this country, also doing business increasingly with some of the developers of data centers as well. And we've owned data centers, and so we understand how they work, how they operate, what the CapEx and OpEx is, and how it's driven by energy and power, and what the right locations are for them. We've developed tools to address them. And so what do we see? We see about a 15% CAGR through the end of the decade for data center demand. I think data center developers are really focused more than anything on three things. They want low cost energy. They want to be able to say that they've accomplished additionality from a decarbonization standpoint, which requires a new facility to be built, not an existing facility. And third piece is it's got to be in the right location, and it's got to have speed to market. And, there's obviously been a lot of talk about renewables and nuclear, and I do want to, I'm a little more of a skeptic, about nukes, and let me explain why that is. They're already in the ground. You can't move them. And if you look at the nuclear fleet, there's only 15 nuclear plants in this country that are west of the Mississippi. And when you think about the 15 that are west of the Mississippi, most of them already rate regulated or long-term contracted. So that really is just creating maybe an east coast opportunity for those that aren't rate regulated and that aren't contracted. I think that's a small subset of nuclear units that could perhaps satisfy east coast demand. But in our discussions with data center providers, getting access to cloud capacity for Silicon Valley, Santa Clara in particular, is critical. I mean, we can all count on one or two fingers how many nuclear plants are located in those regions. Not many. And you just can't move a nuclear plant. And so the thing we bring to the table is a lot of flexibility and speed to market. We can put the renewable project exactly where it needs to be. And SMRs, I hear a lot of talk about SMRs. SMRs are still, a decade to 15 years away. Not only do you have, nine OEMs that are really struggling to access capital. If we pass a sanctions bill against Russia, a nuclear fuel that's going to limit conversion and enrichment capacity in the U.S. for sourcing of nuclear fuel for these SMRs, which also is going to require a real step up in technology to get them done, and you're also dealing with undercapitalized fuel providers. I'm a real skeptic on SMRs really coming into the picture to satisfy data center demand anytime in the near future. And so when you put all of that together, I think the right answer is renewables. In our discussions with data center developers and providers, their first focus is renewables. And I hear a lot about the reliability concerns and, well, what do you do when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and the four hour battery is done enough? We can overbuild the battery. We can also help work with them to design a clean energy solution where if they do have a grid by, we can green it up with wrecks, from our green desk. We have technology and tools, which we showcased back in March, where we can identify partners in the country that not only the best resource areas, but also the best fiber connectivity, the best water resource. And those are the areas that we're locking up. And we have the sites and we have the relationships. And so I don't think anybody's better positioned to capitalize on data center demand than NextEra\u2019s. And I'm very excited about what the future opportunities hold for us there. But the other thing I would say, and we'll talk a lot more about this at our investor conference in June, is this electricity demand is real. We've been in a period of static demand for decades, and the demand is not only coming from data centers, it's coming from decoupling from China, creating more domestic manufacturing around industry, around chip manufacturing. Oil and gas industry continues to electrify. We continue to, even beyond data centers, see significant electric demand. We have the tools. We have the sites. We have the relationships, and we are chasing those opportunities. And look, we're coming off our second best origination quarter ever. I think the results speak for themselves.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJohn Ketchum: Good morning Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Just maybe starting off on NEP, sort of given the continued pressure from capital markets and kind of the benchmark rates, are you sort of advancing any longer-term resolution plans for the CEPFs? I mean, have existing holders and maybe other infrastructure players showed any interest in transactions to fund and maybe simplify the cap structure for longer-term growth? What could that look like? And is this sort of an Analyst Day disclosure? Thanks.\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. A few comments that I'll make on it. One is we have talked about private capital raise potentially being a solution to address back in CEPFs for NEP. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in that, just given NextEra\u2019s stature in the market, NextEra Energy Partner stature in the market. And so those discussions continue to move forward. We don't have anything to say about them right now. We may not have anything to say about them at the Analyst Day. I wouldn't expect us to make a whole lot of comments at the Analyst Day about NEP, when we do have something to say about NEP. As these discussions continue to evolve, we will address them at that point.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. So we'll stay tuned. And then lastly, John, on sort of the FEC, since the process disclosures had been made and obviously showed, FPL was clear of any kind of wrongdoing, there were some kind of disagreements with the FEC commissioners on the nonprofit matters. Is there an appeals path and would there be any further kind of information request to FPL or NextEra, or should we just close the books here?\nJohn Ketchum: Yes, I think the way I look at it, Shahriar is plain and simple. FEC voted. They voted to close the matter. We're now moving on, and I think this is behind us.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. That's it, very comprehensive. Thank you guys, and congrats on the results.\nJohn Ketchum: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mr. Arcaro, your line is open. Is your phone muted accidentally? I'm sorry, we'll need to go to the next questioner. The next questioner comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCarly Davenport: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions today. I appreciate it. I wanted to just ask one on the backlog. Good strength in the additions this quarter and we continue to see a lot of strength in the solar and the storage piece of it. Wind has been a little bit weaker. So I guess just as you think about the difference in the returns on those projects, are there any sort of implications for your financial guidance and your plan as you think about the mix that you've seen actually evolve versus what is in that base plan?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hi Carly, it's Rebecca. I'll take that question. Good morning. Let me start with probably the most important takeaways. First, obviously, Kirk and John highlighted our continued expectations and expressed the fact that we'd be disappointed if we didn't meet the top end of those expectations as we've outlined. So that's most important. Secondly, we continue to be comfortable with the overall development expectations as we also highlighted in the prepared remarks. And that's consistent with what we've seen over time, as we've long stated. Obviously, there's a mix in technologies we, four years in advance, are not always going to be predicting exactly where we're going to be able to develop and what our customers are going to be interested in. And notably, since we laid those expectations out for the first time, a lot did change, including the passage of the IRA. And that had both an impact on changing dynamics for our customers. Buying wind, which was largely in advance, the expectations that the incentives would ultimately wind down. And in the IRA, the introduction of the production tax credit for solar, which made solar more attractive than it was even before, as well as a standalone ITC for storage, so that really spurred demand for solar and storage. But if I can kind of take a step back and kind of pile into the question that Steve answered and some of the comments that John made earlier, we are seeing significant demand across the entire U.S. economy. That of course includes data centers, technology, AI driven compute demand. But it is also manufacturing, the re-domestication of the important industries in the U.S. And it is also oil and gas and chemicals companies looking to get lower cost energy solutions into their mix that spurs a need for a lot of build. So as we look at our 300 gigawatts of products that are in development and the integrated solutions and solutions that we're designing for our customers. I remain very optimistic about all of the technologies in various parts of the country. Wind is most economic in parts of the country. It's going to be solar and storage, etcetera. So I love the portfolio approach. And from returns perspective, I think we continue to realize very attractive returns for all the technologies and of course, adjusted for the types of risks that we think we take. So mid-teens for solar and above 20% levered returns for wind and storage technologies. So I think from an investor standpoint, that's a very attractive proposition.\nCarly Davenport: Awesome. Thanks for that, Rebecca. And then you mentioned in the prepared or the last question, you know, 15% CAGR for data center demand growth through the end of the decade. I guess as you think about some of these other drivers that you've mentioned of increased power demand in the U.S., how do you think that will drive kind of overall load growth? Do you have expectations there through the end of the decade?\nRebecca Kujawa: So we'll have a lot more to say in terms of our expectations and certainly in context of a number of third party views at the investor conference. But I think it's safe to say at this point that we see strong drivers for a long period of time, decades into the future, driving renewables penetration in electricity and electricity penetration into overall U.S. and energy consumption, which sets up terrific dynamics for us to continue to compete and create opportunities to invest capital for our shareholders at very attractive returns. So I love our opportunity set.\nCarly Davenport: Great. Thank you for that color.\nRebecca Kujawa: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning. Thank you for giving me time. Maybe just, Rebecca on the topic of electricity demand growth, one of the questions we consistently get, I think John hinted on this, the 15% data center growth driving it is how quickly can you ramp up? So maybe can you just talk to that? Are there any constraints, whether its equipment, whether it's sites, how quickly can the generation side of this, the renewable generation, can ramp up?\nRebecca Kujawa: Yes, Durgesh, I appreciate the question. I think a little bit of context is important. I think all of us, ourselves included, have really started talking about the significant change in load growth, really over the last year, maybe even the last six months. And you all very much appreciate that a development business, anything connecting to electrical infrastructure, usually talks in terms of years and sometimes a lot of years, depending on the market, to get something into place in the ERCOT [ph] market is maybe a couple of years and some markets in the Midwest that have had congested queues and some transmission constraints. That could be five to seven years. And obviously we've been working for a period of time. I think we're the least behind of anybody with our 300 gigawatt portfolio, but some of this will take some time to materialize. I feel very confident in long term trends. I feel really excited and pleased with our team's preparedness in terms of the development of that pipeline. And I very much think our competitive advantages that John highlighted on scale, experience, and technology really position us well in the types of conversations we're having with our customers, creating this long term visibility into demand dynamics. You guys asked John the question about data centers and how competitive we are with them. They are not looking for projects anymore. They are looking for integrated solutions that solve long-term problems for them, and we are a perfect partner for them with which to work.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's very helpful, Rebecca. And then maybe just a quick follow up. I think you made comments around very healthy returns. Are you seeing higher returns, higher margins with your data center clients versus your other clients? I mean, some of your peers have highlighted high returns there. Maybe just comment on that.\nRebecca Kujawa: I continue to believe we have very attractive returns across the board, consistent with the comments that I've made today, as well as the comments we made at our development 101-day and included in our monthly updates for investor materials. So mid-teens and solar, and above 20% for both wind and storage, of course, as we talk with customers and we have unique solutions that solve particular problems that we have, we design the solutions to meet those needs and always stay focused at the end of the day on what's the attractive value proposition from an investor standpoint and we remain disciplined around that. So I love the portfolio, I love positioning, and I believe what we ultimately deliver for investors is very attractive.\nDurgesh Chopra: That is very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Excuse me, Mr. Tonet, your line is open. Is your phone\u2026? Thank you.\nJeremy Tonet: Good morning. I just want to start off on storage originations coming in quite strong and if there's any?\nRebecca Kujawa: Hey, Jeremy, it's Rebecca. I'm going to go for the presumptive close on the answer. Hopefully it's the question you actually asked. Storage origination is very strong, as Kirk highlighted in some of the prepared remarks, and John commented in Q&A, as we think about our customers\u2019 needs for energy and capacity, it remains a very attractive value proposition to incorporate storage to firm up renewables, either co located or separate so we're seeing terrific origination from an energy resources perspective and we've also talked today about the attractiveness of storage at FPL. So I'll hand it off to Armando to give some additional color.\nArmando Pimentel: Thanks, Rebecca. So I would add, if you recall John and Kirk's comments, we filed our 10 year site plan, which we do every year. Our 10 year site plan this year had the same amount of solar that it did last year, which is a lot of solar, 21 gigs over the next 10 years. But we doubled the amount of storage, up to 4 gigawatts of storage that we have in our plan. We increasingly see storage as an economical addition in our service area. My expectations are that as time goes on, that we would likely add more storage to our plans going forward, because it is that attractive in the overall economics, especially as we add solar, which again, continues to be the best proposition from a cost standpoint for our customers.\nJeremy Tonet: Thank you for that. Just going back to the renewable development day or for people that weren't able to make it, any particular points I want to highlight?\nRebecca Kujawa: Jeremy, you broke up a little bit, so I'm going to again guess a little bit on what the question was, but I'm assuming it was what were some of the key takeaways from the development 101-day. And I hope it was a worthwhile time for our investors. We certainly were so proud of our team and talking about what it is that we believe differentiates us as we talk to our customers. And it really was around that scale experience and technology, not just individually, how all of those are important, but also how they interact with one another. So as John highlighted, the scale advantages comes the ability to deploy technologies that are unique and with experience, we actually are able to invest in capturing that data that we get from scale and put in technologies to actually get some really cool insights. So I think the key takeaway, from my perspective, is significant load growth. Certainly some opportunities to put deploy that scale experience of technology, to deploy unique and compelling solutions to our customers, so I love our growth prospects. I love the position that we have, just as John highlighted in his comments and look forward to telling you more at the investor conference in June.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners LP earning conference call.

            "name": "Kirk Crews",
            "content": "Thank you, John. For the first quarter of 2024, FPL's earnings per share increased $0.04 year over year. The principal driver of this performance was FPL's regulatory capital employed growth of approximately 11.5% year-over-year. We now expect FPL to realize roughly 10% average annual growth in regulatory capital employed over our current rate agreements four-year term, which runs through 2025. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.3 billion for the quarter and we expect FPL's full year 2024 capital investments to be between $7.8 billion and $8.8 billion. For the twelve months ending March 2024 FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.8%. During the first quarter, we utilized approximately $572 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of roughly $651 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year, and we expect this trend to continue this year. Earlier this month, FPL received approval to reduce customer bills due to projected 2024 fuel savings. As a result, FPL's typical 1000 kilowatt hour residential customer bill is expected to be roughly $14 lower in May than the start of the year and approximately 37% lower than the current national average. Over the current four-year settlement agreement we now expect FPL's capital investments to be slightly above our previous range of $32 billion to $34 billion. This quarter FPL placed into service 1640 MW of new cost effective solar, putting FPL's owned and operated solar portfolio at over 6400 MW, which is the largest utility owned solar portfolio in the country. FPL's annual ten-year site plan continues to indicate that solar and storage are the most cost effective answer for customers to add reliable grid capacity over the next decade. The 2024 plan includes similar levels of new solar generation capacity 21 gigawatts across our service territory over the next ten years compared to our 2023 plan. But our 2024 plan doubles the expected deployment of battery storage to over 4 gigawatts, some of which we expect to be needed earlier than forecasted in our 2023 plan. With this plan, we expect to increase FPL solar mix from approximately 6% of our total generation in 2023% to 38% in 2033 while continuing to provide customers with clean, affordable energy. FPL believes battery storage will play an increasingly valuable role for customers, serving as an attractive capacity complement to our growing solar generation. From providing system balancing needs in critical parts of FPL's service territory to supplying energy during any time of day or weather condition, battery storage acts as a key resource to the system that is both valuable and cost effective for customers. Key indicators show that Florida's economy remains healthy. Florida continues to be one of the fastest growing states in the nation and had four of the five fastest growing U.S. metro areas between 2022 and 2023. FPL had its strongest quarter of customer growth in over 15 years, with the average number of customers increasing by more than 100,000 from the comparable prior year period. Although FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased by approximately 1.3% year-over-year, we estimate that weather had a negative impact on usage per customer of approximately 5.4% on a year-over-year basis. After taking weather into account, first quarter retail sales increased roughly 4.1% on a weather normalized basis from the comparable prior year period, driven primarily by continued favorable underlying population growth and usage per customer. Now let's turn to Energy Resources, which reported adjusted earnings growth of approximately 13.1% year-over-year. Contributions from new investments increased $0.15 per share year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued growth in our renewables portfolio. Our existing clean energy portfolio declined $0.02 per share, primarily due to unfavorable wind resource during the quarter. The comparative contribution from our customer supply business increased results by $0.04 per share. All other impacts reduced earnings by $0.12 per share. This decline reflects higher interest costs of $0.07 per share, half of which related to new borrowing costs to support new investments. Energy Resources had a strong quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2765 to the backlog. With these additions, our backlog now totals roughly 21.5 gigawatts after taking into account 1165 MW of new projects placed into service since our last earnings call, highlighting Energy Resources ability to continue to identify attractive and accretive investment opportunities which provide strong growth visibility in the years ahead. We recently plugged 740 MW of new solar and storage projects into service which are being used to support data centers located in Arizona and New Mexico. Both of these projects are now one of the largest battery storage facilities in their respective states and in combination with their co-located solar each project enabled the local utility to serve their customers need for new, reliable, clean energy to grow their own business operations. We are proud to continue to support our power and commercial and industrial customers to meet their growing power and capacity needs create jobs and provide economic development in these local communities. Our origination activities across our power and commercial and industrial customers are beginning to reflect the rising power demand. We are seeing it manifest with our power customers in their state RFP processes and bilateral discussions where we deliver cost effective renewables and storage to their grid. We are also observing it through interactions with our oil and gas and manufacturing customers where we utilize our data and technology to help them make better siting decisions. Our technology customers have been a consistent driver of demand for many years, reflected by our roughly 3 gigawatt operating portfolio and over 3 gigawatt project backlog as we partner with them to provide various clean energy solutions based on their key business variables. We are a partner with both our power and commercial industrial customers trust. We leverage our 3 gigawatt development pipeline, our 35 gigawatt operating renewables and storage portfolio, and our transformer and switchgear procurement covering energy resources billed through 2027 to deliver projects for customers. As John said, the power demand growth is expected to be strong through at least the end of the decade. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for new renewables and storage origination. This is on the heels of two consecutive record origination years at Energy Resources. We continue to expect to remain on track for our overall renewables development expectations of roughly 33 to 42 gigawatts from 2023 through 2026. Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmissions was recently selected by the California ISO to develop a new a two-mile, 500 kV transmission line in Southern California, with a capital investment of more than $250 million. We believe this project could unlock over 3 gigawatts of new renewable generation capacity, supporting California's ambitious clean energy goals. This award follows a record year for NextEra Energy Transmission in 2023 and we remain excited about the opportunities ahead for this growing business. We continue to believe our ability to build, own and operate transmission is a key advantage for our renewables business. Turning now to our first quarter 2024 consolidated results, adjusted earnings from corporate and other decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. This quarter, we entered into an agreement to transfer approximately $1 billion of tax credits throughout 2024, representing the bulk of our expected transfers for the year. Our long-term financial expectations remain unchanged. We will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted EPS expectation ranges in 2024, 2025 and 2026. From 2021 to 2026, we continue to expect that our average annual growth in operating cash flow will be at or above our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. And as we announced in February, the Board of Directors of NextEra Energy approved a targeted growth rate in dividends per share of roughly 10% per year through at least 2026 off a 2024 base. As always, our expectations assume our caveat. Turning to NextEra Energy Partners, we continue to focus on executing against the partnerships transition plan and delivering an LP distribution growth target of 6% through at least 2026. We bought out the STX Midstream convertible equity portfolio financing in 2023 and have sufficient proceeds available from the Texas pipeline portfolio sale to complete the NEP Renewables II buyout due in June 2024 and 2025. The third convertible equity portfolio financing associated with the Meade natural gas pipeline assets is expected to be addressed in 2025. With the plan for the near-term convertible equity portfolio financings well understood, we remain focused on the partnership's cost of capital improving, which is critical for its success. With that objective in mind, we continue to evaluate alternatives to address the remaining convertible equity portfolio financing with equity buyout obligations in 2027 and beyond. Turning to the partnership's targeted 6% growth in LP distributions per unit, NextEra Energy Partners does not expect to need an acquisition this year to achieve its 6% targeted growth rate and the partnership does not expect to require growth equity until 2027. In terms of NextEra Energy Partners growth plan, as a reminder, it involves organic growth, specifically re-powering of approximately 1.3 gigawatts of wind projects through 2026, as well as acquiring assets at attractive yields. Today we are announcing plans to repower an additional approximately 100 MW of wind facilities through 2026. The partnership has now announced roughly 1085 MW of repowers. Yesterday, NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of 89.25 cents per common unit or $3.57 per common unit on an annualized basis, which reflects an annualized increase of 6% from its fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit. Let me now turn to the detailed results. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $462 million and cash available for distribution was $164 million. New projects, which primarily reflect contributions from approximately 840 net megawatts of new projects that either closed in the second quarter of 2023 or achieved commercial operations in 2023, contributed approximately $32 million of adjusted EBITDA and $7 million of cash available for distribution. First quarter adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects declined by approximately $37 million year-over-year, driven primarily by unfavorable wind resource during the quarter and lower generation at Genesis Solar Project as a result of a planned outage for major maintenance. Wind resource was approximately 97% of long-term average versus 102% in the first quarter of 2023. The incentive distribution right fee suspension provided approximately $39 million of benefit this quarter for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. Finally, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution declined by approximately $44 million and $38 million respectively, for the divestiture of the Texas pipeline portfolio. From a base of our fourth quarter 2023 distribution per common unit and an annualized rate of $3.52, we continue to see 5% to 8% growth per year in LP distributions per unit, with a current target of 6% growth per year as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2026. We continue to expect the partnerships payout ratio to be in the mid-90s through 2026. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2024 distribution that is payable in February 2025 to be $3.73 per common unit. NextEra Energy Partners expects run rate contributions for adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution from its forecasted portfolio at December 31, 2024 to be in the ranges of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion and $730 million to $820 million respectively. As a reminder, yearend 2024 run rate projections reflect calendar year 2025 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at year end 2024. As a reminder, our expectations are subject to our caveat. That concludes our prepared remarks and with that we will open the line for questions."

Obviously, there's a mix in technologies we, four years in advance, are not always going to be predicting exactly where we're going to be able to develop and what our customers are going to be interested in. And notably, since we laid those expectations out for the first time, a lot did change, including the passage of the IRA. And that had both an impact on changing dynamics for our customers. Buying wind, which was largely in advance, the expectations that the incentives would ultimately wind down. And in the IRA, the introduction of the production tax credit for solar, which made solar more attractive than it was even before, as well as a standalone ITC for storage, so that really spurred demand for solar and storage. But if I can kind of take a step back and kind of pile into the question that Steve answered and some of the comments that John made earlier, we are seeing significant demand across the entire U.S. economy. That of course includes data centers, technology, AI driven compute demand. But it is also manufacturing, the re-domestication of the important industries in the U.S. And it is also oil and gas and chemicals companies looking to get lower cost energy solutions into their mix that spurs a need for a lot of build. So as we look at our 300 gigawatts of products that are in development and the integrated solutions and solutions that we're designing for our customers. I remain very optimistic about all of the technologies in various parts of the country. Wind is most economic in parts of the country. It's going to be solar and storage, etcetera. So I love the portfolio approach. And from returns perspective, I think we continue to realize very attractive returns for all the technologies and of course, adjusted for the types of risks that we think we take. So mid-teens for solar and above 20% levered returns for wind and storage technologies. So I think from an investor standpoint, that's a very attractive proposition. So we'll have a lot more to say in terms of our expectations and certainly in context of a number of third party views at the investor conference. But I think it's safe to say at this point that we see strong drivers for a long period of time, decades into the future, driving renewables penetration in electricity and electricity penetration into overall U.S. and energy consumption, which sets up terrific dynamics for us to continue to compete and create opportunities to invest capital for our shareholders at very attractive returns. So I love our opportunity set. Thank you. Yes, Durgesh, I appreciate the question. I think a little bit of context is important. I think all of us, ourselves included, have really started talking about the significant change in load growth, really over the last year, maybe even the last six months. And you all very much appreciate that a development business, anything connecting to electrical infrastructure, usually talks in terms of years and sometimes a lot of years, depending on the market, to get something into place in the ERCOT [ph] market is maybe a couple of years and some markets in the Midwest that have had congested queues and some transmission constraints. That could be five to seven years. And obviously we've been working for a period of time. I think we're the least behind of anybody with our 300 gigawatt portfolio, but some of this will take some time to materialize. I feel very confident in long term trends. I feel really excited and pleased with our team's preparedness in terms of the development of that pipeline. And I very much think our competitive advantages that John highlighted on scale, experience, and technology really position us well in the types of conversations we're having with our customers, creating this long term visibility into demand dynamics. You guys asked John the question about data centers and how competitive we are with them. They are not looking for projects anymore. They are looking for integrated solutions that solve long-term problems for them, and we are a perfect partner for them with which to work. I continue to believe we have very attractive returns across the board, consistent with the comments that I've made today, as well as the comments we made at our development 101-day and included in our monthly updates for investor materials. So mid-teens and solar, and above 20% for both wind and storage, of course, as we talk with customers and we have unique solutions that solve particular problems that we have, we design the solutions to meet those needs and always stay focused at the end of the day on what's the attractive value proposition from an investor standpoint and we remain disciplined around that. So I love the portfolio, I love positioning, and I believe what we ultimately deliver for investors is very attractive. Hey, Jeremy, it's Rebecca. I'm going to go for the presumptive close on the answer. Hopefully it's the question you actually asked. Storage origination is very strong, as Kirk highlighted in some of the prepared remarks, and John commented in Q&A, as we think about our customers' needs for energy and capacity, it remains a very attractive value proposition to incorporate storage to firm up renewables, either co located or separate so we're seeing terrific origination from an energy resources perspective and we've also talked today about the attractiveness of storage at FPL. So I'll hand it off to Armando to give some additional color. Jeremy, you broke up a little bit, so I'm going to again guess a little bit on what the question was, but I'm assuming it was what were some of the key takeaways from the development 101-day. And I hope it was a worthwhile time for our investors. We certainly were so proud of our team and talking about what it is that we believe differentiates us as we talk to our customers. And it really was around that scale experience and technology, not just individually, how all of those are important, but also how they interact with one another. So as John highlighted, the scale advantages comes the ability to deploy technologies that are unique and with experience, we actually are able to invest in capturing that data that we get from scale and put in technologies to actually get some really cool insights. So I think the key takeaway, from my perspective, is significant load growth. Certainly some opportunities to put deploy that scale experience of technology, to deploy unique and compelling solutions to our customers, so I love our growth prospects. I love the position that we have, just as John highlighted in his comments and look forward to telling you more at the investor conference in June."

            "name": "John Ketchum",
            "content": "Thanks Kristen and good morning. NextEra Energy has strong first quarter results growing adjusted earnings per share by 8.3% year-over-year. Based on FPL and energy resources, financial and operational performance, we are once again off to a solid start for the year. In addition, FPL placed into service 1640 MW of new solar, while Energy Resources added 2765 MW of new renewables and storage projects to its backlog. This quarter marks Energy Resources second best origination quarter ever, as well as its best solar and best storage origination quarter. As we highlighted at our March Renewables Development Day, we believe NextEra Energy is well positioned for the expected strong power demand growth through the end of the decade and beyond. After years of relatively flat U.S. power growth, numerous reports now highlight significant future low growth being driven across industries such as oil and gas, manufacturing and technology. The re-domestication of industry to U.S., supported by public policy, will drive the need for more electricity and the tech industry is going to need data centers to support the expected cloud capacity demands that come with artificial intelligence applications. Of course, increased load demand will not come all at once and will take some time to materialize, but it is clear that many new customers are concerned about power availability to meet their plans and consider power supply as a significant obstacle to business expansion. We believe renewables and storage are a key enabler to help meet this increased demand. In fact, we believe the U.S. renewables and storage market opportunity has the potential to be 3x bigger over the next seven years compared to the last seven, growing from roughly 140 gigawatts of additions to approximately 375 to 450 gigawatts. And we believe no one is better positioned to address these power supply challenges and capitalize on this demand than NextEra Energy. At NextEra Energy, the plan is simple. Our two businesses are deploying capital in renewables, storage and transmission for the benefit of customers, while also providing visible growth opportunities for shareholders. Our enterprise-wide scale decades of experience and technology investments are key competitive advantages that allow us to drive value and meet this expected power demand. Scale is one of our key differentiators, and it matters more than ever. Scale allows us to buy and build with better pricing, better protections, and better positioning to navigate disruption. Scale provides access to capital and cost of capital advantages, allowing us to leverage one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and worldwide banking relationships to finance projects at beneficial terms. Scale has driven top decile operational performance throughout our generation fleet. Today, NextEra Energy's roughly 74 gigawatt operating fleet, comprised of 35 gigawatts at FPL and 39 gigawatts at Energy Resources, provide significant operational scale. As FPL continues its solar and storage build out and Energy Resources brings new renewables and storage projects online for customers, the operating fleet could grow to over 100 gigawatts by the end of 2026. This would further extend our scale advantages and create value for customers and shareholders. Our scale has enabled greater supply chain diversification and flexibility. And the good news is the solar supply chain has much improved from two years ago. Inflationary pressures are alleviating and manufacturing capacity is significantly expanding. In the U.S. manufacturing incentives are expected to support increases in domestic module manufacturing capacity to over 50 gigawatts by 2026 from just under 8 gigawatts at the end of 2021. We have greater supplier diversity and flexibility than ever before, strengthening our ability to bring low cost solar to American consumers and businesses. Our decades of experience is another key competitive advantage. Our experience allows us to navigate power demand challenges, delivering cost effective, reliable generation for our growing FPL customer base and designing clean energy solutions to help our Energy Resources customers. We understand every part of the energy value chain with deep expertise in all technologies, the power markets and transmission. Our team embraces continuous improvement that drives innovation. We recognized the changing landscape and secured land interconnects and transmission equipment years in advance. Technology is the next frontier for the power industry, and we believe our two-decade head start on the rest of the industry is a significant competitive advantage. Today, NextEra Energy captures 560 billion operational data points each day and has dozens of proprietary artificial intelligence tools to drive analytical, real-time decision making. We use these tools to analyze over 100 attributes of our own data to secure and develop the best sites in Florida and across the country. We use our tools to iterate millions of site layout designs based on proprietary resource data and assessments to maximize value, and we use our tools to operate nearly all our renewable storage and fossil generation fleets around the clock from our headquarters in South Florida. We are leveraging this combination of enterprise-wide scale, decades of experience and investment in technology to better position both businesses to capitalize on what we believe will be years of demand to drive long-term value for customers and shareholders. Today, electricity represents just 20% of overall U.S. energy consumption, and wind and solar generation represents only 16% of the U.S. electricity mix. In short, we believe the U.S. will need a significant and growing amount of electricity over the next decade and beyond, a large part of which will be powered by new renewables and storage. At FPL as more people move into Florida, we are focused on extending the customer value proposition by keeping our bills as low as possible and delivering clean, affordable energy by investing in solar, battery storage and transmission. At Energy Resources, our business is focusing on building low cost wind, solar, battery storage, and transmission. We are using our data and proprietary technology to help power customers balance supply and demand while keeping customer bills affordable. We also use our tools with commercial and industrial customers to identify the best locations based on their physical preferences and most important variables. For both power and commercial and industrial customers we leverage our 300 gigawatt development pipeline and transmission and market expertise to help design the lowest cost clean energy solutions. Both businesses complement each other, deepen our skill sets and advantages, and foster innovation and we leverage our greatest asset, our people, who have decades of experience to drive value for our customers and shareholders. When I consider current energy demands, the long-term electricity needs, and our competitive advantages, I wouldn't trade our opportunity set with anyone. I look forward to telling more of our story and explaining why NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to lead the electrification of the U.S. economy at our Investor Day on June 11 in New York City. With that, I will turn the call over to Kirk to cover the quarterly results. Sure. Steve, this is John. I'll go ahead and take that. Let me take those in order. Let me talk about, first of all, the speculation around AD/CVD filing, which, may or may not occur, and then the bifacial exemption. But first on the AD/CVD, the bottom line takeaway for folks is that, we expect that any trade actions that would occur this time around will be very manageable and for several reasons, I'm going to go through them. This is not like circumvention. This is not circumvention 2.0. The solar panel market is in a very different spot. And the first point, I want to make is, we don't expect any trade action, if it were to occur, to result in delivery stoppages. And in any event, our panels are delivered well in advance of construction, which gives us a lot of time and opportunity to be able to troubleshoot any issues should they arise. And why do I think no stoppages are going to occur this time around? The main reason is the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world and so there's a lot of economic reasons for deliveries to continue to occur. The second point, I want to make is that given our scale, we have appropriate incentives and contractual protections that are in place in our agreements with our suppliers to ensure that delivery occurs timely. And we also don't put all of our eggs in one basket. We have a diversified set of suppliers, as you would all expect, and the ability to pivot from one supplier to another should any issues occur. So I feel like in very good spot there. Third point I want to make, and it's one that I hit in my prepared remarks, is that the U.S. and the global supply, supply of solar panels is bigger than ever and it's growing. And let me talk, for example, about the U.S. market, specifically. The U.S. domestic solar panel industry is getting stronger and stronger than it's ever been. One of the points that I made also in the prepared remarks is at the end of 2021, solar panel module capacity in the U.S. was about 8 gigawatts. That's expected to be about 50 gigawatts by the time we get to 2026. So the U.S. market is in a much different spot. There's already been 150 gigawatts of new U.S. solar panel factory announcements that have been made. If you talk to most U.S. domestic solar panel manufacturers, they're sold out through 2026. So they're certainly not having any trouble with demand, which is the other point that I want to make. So now let's speculate a little bit. So if a filing is made around anti-dumping, let me deal with that first. We find it hard to believe that any panels are being dumped into the U.S. market under the law that would be applied. As I said, the U.S. is the most expensive solar panel market in the world. It's two to three times higher than any other market in the world. And if panels were being dumped, that could not be the case. So that's the first point I want to make on anti-dumping. The second point I want to make, if there were a countervailing duty claim filed, the Department of Commerce would first have to look in to see if the price of solar modules in Southeast Asian countries, for example, were being subsidized. We don't really have any idea or way of knowing that until we see what gets filed. But, after we see those arguments, we'll be able to make a better assessment. But countervailing duties, historically, I mean, if you look at examples for countervailing duties that have been applied in the past against China suppliers, they've typically been around, 10% to 15%. So even if those were to be applied in this case, quite mean, manageable. And the other point I want to make is that what's different is tariffs in this situation would be prospective and not retroactive. And so for all of these reasons, even if something were to move forward, we still have no way of knowing if it will. We are very well positioned to manage through this, like we always do. Our inventory position and the contractual protections that we have in place are expected to give us strong coverage for our backlog through 2027. And by that time, as more and more U.S. production comes online, as expected, these trade issues will fall away. So that's AD/CVD. Let me just turn quickly to a couple of minor comments on the bifacial exemption. The bottom line, the bifacial exemption, even if it's removed, really has no impact on NextEra. Why is that? We've contracted all of our panel needs through February 26, and we have very minimal exposure to the bifacial exemption being removed. And once that bifacial exemption, even if removed, it would expire at the end of February of 2026, and it can't be brought again and reinstated for another eight years. So we feel like we're in a very good spot. And the last point I'll make is as more and more U.S. production capacity comes online and it's actually available by, we will continue to source from U.S. suppliers. So look, when you put all those things together, feel like this is very manageable and feel like we will be fine. I think kind of all of the above, Steve. Our opportunity is significant around data centers is a point, first point that I'll make and I think if you look historically on what we've been able to do with data center customers, I don't think anybody's had better results than we have. If you look at just our gigawatts in operation, we have 3.5 gigawatts in operation today. We have another 3, close to 3.5 gigawatts in our backlog with technology providers. We really understand their business. We really understand what it is they need. And part of that is because we spent a lot of time with them, we do business with all the, what I would call the top five hyperscalers in this country, also doing business increasingly with some of the developers of data centers as well. And we've owned data centers, and so we understand how they work, how they operate, what the CapEx and OpEx is, and how it's driven by energy and power, and what the right locations are for them. We've developed tools to address them. And so what do we see? We see about a 15% CAGR through the end of the decade for data center demand. I think data center developers are really focused more than anything on three things. They want low cost energy. They want to be able to say that they've accomplished additionality from a decarbonization standpoint, which requires a new facility to be built, not an existing facility. And third piece is it's got to be in the right location, and it's got to have speed to market. And, there's obviously been a lot of talk about renewables and nuclear, and I do want to, I'm a little more of a skeptic, about nukes, and let me explain why that is. They're already in the ground. You can't move them. And if you look at the nuclear fleet, there's only 15 nuclear plants in this country that are west of the Mississippi. And when you think about the 15 that are west of the Mississippi, most of them already rate regulated or long-term contracted. So that really is just creating maybe an east coast opportunity for those that aren't rate regulated and that aren't contracted. I think that's a small subset of nuclear units that could perhaps satisfy east coast demand. But in our discussions with data center providers, getting access to cloud capacity for Silicon Valley, Santa Clara in particular, is critical. I mean, we can all count on one or two fingers how many nuclear plants are located in those regions. Not many. And you just can't move a nuclear plant. And so the thing we bring to the table is a lot of flexibility and speed to market. We can put the renewable project exactly where it needs to be. And SMRs, I hear a lot of talk about SMRs. SMRs are still, a decade to 15 years away. Not only do you have, nine OEMs that are really struggling to access capital. If we pass a sanctions bill against Russia, a nuclear fuel that's going to limit conversion and enrichment capacity in the U.S. for sourcing of nuclear fuel for these SMRs, which also is going to require a real step up in technology to get them done, and you're also dealing with undercapitalized fuel providers. I'm a real skeptic on SMRs really coming into the picture to satisfy data center demand anytime in the near future. And so when you put all of that together, I think the right answer is renewables. In our discussions with data center developers and providers, their first focus is renewables. And I hear a lot about the reliability concerns and, well, what do you do when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and the four hour battery is done enough? We can overbuild the battery. We can also help work with them to design a clean energy solution where if they do have a grid by, we can green it up with wrecks, from our green desk. We have technology and tools, which we showcased back in March, where we can identify partners in the country that not only the best resource areas, but also the best fiber connectivity, the best water resource. And those are the areas that we're locking up. And we have the sites and we have the relationships. And so I don't think anybody's better positioned to capitalize on data center demand than NextEra's. And I'm very excited about what the future opportunities hold for us there. But the other thing I would say, and we'll talk a lot more about this at our investor conference in June, is this electricity demand is real. We've been in a period of static demand for decades, and the demand is not only coming from data centers, it's coming from decoupling from China, creating more domestic manufacturing around industry, around chip manufacturing. Oil and gas industry continues to electrify. We continue to, even beyond data centers, see significant electric demand. We have the tools. We have the sites. We have the relationships, and we are chasing those opportunities. And look, we're coming off our second best origination quarter ever. I think the results speak for themselves. Good morning Shahriar. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. A few comments that I'll make on it. One is we have talked about private capital raise potentially being a solution to address back in CEPFs for NEP. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in that, just given NextEra's stature in the market, NextEra Energy Partner stature in the market. And so those discussions continue to move forward. We don't have anything to say about them right now. We may not have anything to say about them at the Analyst Day. I wouldn't expect us to make a whole lot of comments at the Analyst Day about NEP, when we do have something to say about NEP. As these discussions continue to evolve, we will address them at that point. Yes, I think the way I look at it, Shahriar is plain and simple. FEC voted. They voted to close the matter. We're now moving on, and I think this is behind us. Thank you."
